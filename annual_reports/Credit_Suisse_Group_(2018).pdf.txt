We have delivered on the \nstrategy we defined in 2015 of creating a leading wealth manager with \nstrong investment banking capabilities. \n\nDear shareholders, clients and colleagues\n\nWhen we launched our restructuring program three years ago, \nour objective was to become a leading, resilient wealth manager \nwith strong investment banking capabilities. We are pleased to \nreport that we have delivered on the goals we set ourselves in \n2015. \n\nsaw quite extreme market conditions not seen in many years. We \nachieved the highest fourth quarter adjusted* income before taxes \nsince 2013 in the fourth quarter of 2018, our ninth consecutive \nquarter of year-on-year growth. Income before taxes for 2018 \nwas CHF\xc2\xa03.37 billion, up 88% year on year, and on an adjusted* \nbasis, income before taxes rose 52% year on year to CHF\xc2\xa04.19 \nbillion. \n\nOur restructuring was aimed at taking advantage of the growing \nglobal wealth by profitably growing our wealth management activi-\nties as well as making the Group more resilient by reducing risks, \ncutting costs and strengthening our capital base. We wanted to \ngrow our Wealth Management-related revenues, and within that \ncategory, our recurring income streams. We wanted to establish \na culture of generating profitable, sustainable, compliant growth. \nWe also set out to right-size our Global Markets (GM) business. \nLast but not least, we wanted to deal resolutely with our key \nlegacy issues. These objectives have broadly been achieved, and \nour performance in 2018, in a challenging market environment, \nwith severe stresses particularly in the final quarter of the year, \nillustrates the progress we have made since 2015. \n\nIn our Wealth Management-related businesses, we intend to con-\ntinue to follow a balanced approach between mature and emerg-\ning markets and focus on ultra-high net worth (UHNW), high \nnet worth (HNW) and entrepreneur clients in our core markets. \nWe will serve these clients\xe2\x80\x99 private wealth and business finan-\ncial needs across our suite of products and services, working to \ndeliver an integrated offering and delivering bespoke solutions in \nour efforts to help them grow and protect their wealth and busi-\nness needs. Having both strong wealth management skills and \nstrong investment banking capabilities is therefore crucial for us \nand key to the success of our strategy. \n\nA strategy that delivers\nDuring 2018, we continued to deliver on our objectives in spite \nof significant market volatility during the year. In the first half of \n2018, markets were favorable, and we experienced strong cli-\nent activity. In the second half of the year, we faced more chal-\nlenging market conditions and a significant drop in client activity \nresulting from a combination of factors, including increasing trade \ntensions, concern about the potential impact of higher US inter-\nest rates and a rise in geopolitical uncertainty. Despite these \nchallenges, we operated profitably in every quarter on both a \nreported and adjusted basis, including the fourth quarter, which \n\nOur performance in 2018 is a testament to the actions we have \ntaken during our restructuring to create a Group that should now \nbe more resilient in the face of market turbulence. By dealing \nwith legacy issues effectively, reallocating capital towards our \nmore stable, capital-efficient and profitable Wealth Manage-\nment-related and Investment Banking & Capital Markets (IBCM) \nbusinesses and right sizing our GM activities, we have built what \nwe had set out to create: a leading wealth manager with strong \ninvestment banking capabilities. \n\nWe reported net income attributable to shareholders of CHF\xc2\xa02.02 \nbillion for 2018. This was our first annual post-tax profit since \n2014, despite a higher than expected effective tax rate of 40% \nfor the year. \n\nDriving profitable, compliant growth \nWe have made substantial progress in rebalancing the alloca-\ntion of our capital towards our Wealth Management-related and \nInvestment Banking & Capital Markets businesses. In 2015, we \nwere faced with a more market-dependent business that deliv-\nered volatile revenues and had high fixed costs combined with \nhigh and rising capital needs. We have since transformed the \nbusiness. We sought to gear the Group towards more recur-\nring revenues from our Wealth Management-related businesses. \nWe did this by allocating more capital to the Swiss Universal \nBank (SUB), International Wealth Management (IWM) and Asia \nPacific Wealth Management & Connected (APAC WM&C). We \nalso focused on increasing collaboration across divisions; a prime \nexample of which is our International Trading Solutions (ITS) busi-\nness that brings together talent from across GM, IWM and SUB \nto deliver bespoke, institutional quality solutions to our UHNW \nand HNW clients. Since the start of this reshaping of our busi-\nness, our Wealth Management-related adjusted* net revenues \nhave grown at a 5% compound annual growth rate since 2015, \nan industry leading performance in a period marked by several \nsuccessive, severe market dislocations, such as in the last quarter \nof 2015 and in the last quarter of 2018.\n\n4\n\nMessage from the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nUrs Rohner, Chairman of the Board of Directors (left) and Tidjane Thiam, Chief Executive Officer.\n\nThe outlook for continued growth in wealth management remains \nattractive. The global pool of wealth has nearly doubled over the \nlast ten years and as it continues to grow, we are seeing posi-\ntive momentum across our Wealth Management-related busi-\nnesses, where thanks to our disciplined approach to growth, risk, \ncapital and costs, we have been able to produce higher profits \nand higher returns on capital since 2015. In 2018, we reported \nstrong Wealth Management net new assets of CHF\xc2\xa034.4 billion, \nthe result of net inflows in every quarter. Importantly, approxi-\nmately 75% of these net new assets came from UHNW clients \ncompared to approximately 50% in 2015. Across the Group, we \nattracted total net new assets of CHF\xc2\xa056.5 billion, up 49% year \non year. The Group has grown healthily throughout its restructur-\ning: since 2015, we have attracted more than CHF\xc2\xa0120 billion \nof net new assets. At the end of 2018, we reached a total of \nCHF\xc2\xa01.35 trillion in assets under management. \n\nIn our home market here in Switzerland, we made strong progress \nin SUB delivering an adjusted* income before taxes of CHF\xc2\xa02.2 \nbillion, up 18% year on year. Both Private Clients and Corporate \n& Institutional Clients delivered improved adjusted* income before \ntaxes in 2018, reflecting strong revenues and rigorous cost dis-\ncipline. SUB\xe2\x80\x99s increased full-year profitability was the result of \nboth an increase in adjusted* net revenues to CHF\xc2\xa05.5 billion, \nwith increased recurring commissions and fees and net interest \nincome, and cost reductions. \n\nIn IWM, we had a successful year with adjusted* income before \ntaxes up 21% year on year, reaching our target of CHF\xc2\xa01.8 bil-\nlion. This step change in profitability was achieved in a chal-\nlenging environment. IWM achieved adjusted* net revenues of \nCHF\xc2\xa05.4 billion in 2018, growing 4% year on year. In Private \nBanking, adjusted* income before taxes was up 24% at CHF\xc2\xa01.4 \nbillion, driven by 7% revenue growth, with higher revenues across \nall major categories, and in Asset Management, adjusted* income \nbefore taxes grew by 12% to CHF\xc2\xa0427 million. \n\nMessage from the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer\n\n5\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nIn APAC, we generated adjusted* income before taxes of \nCHF\xc2\xa0804 million in 2018, slightly higher than the prior year. Our \nperformance in the division reflects the resilience of our wealth \nmanagement strategy and our leading business franchises within \nthe region as 2018 was marked by significant market dislocation \nacross Asia, reporting the worst fourth quarter for Asian equity \nmarkets since 2008. APAC WM&C\xe2\x80\x99s adjusted* income before \ntaxes of CHF\xc2\xa0797 million in 2018 was down 3%. APAC Markets \nreported an adjusted* income before taxes of CHF\xc2\xa07 million in \n2018, an improvement from the adjusted* loss before taxes of \nCHF\xc2\xa028 million in 2017, despite market conditions.\n\nIn IBCM, we delivered 4% year on year growth with adjusted* \nincome before taxes of CHF\xc2\xa0429 million in 2018. This result \nwas driven by a 2% increase in net revenues, resulting from \nstrong performance in advisory, particularly M&A, which was \npartially offset by lower financing activity, in line with the Street1. \nTotal global advisory and underwriting revenues for 2018 were \nUSD\xc2\xa04.0 billion, down 2% year on year, but outperforming the \nStreet2 in a challenging market environment. \n\nIn GM, we demonstrated strict resource and risk discipline in a \nchallenging operating environment characterized by high levels \nof volatility and widening credit spreads. GM was profitable in \n2018 with an adjusted* income before taxes of CHF\xc2\xa0406 mil-\nlion. We maintained a dynamic approach to capital management \nand decreased our leverage exposure by 13%. Additionally, our \nadjusted* total operating expenses decreased by 7% year on year \nto CHF\xc2\xa04.6 billion. \n\nDelivering value to our shareholders post-restructuring\nAt our Investor Day in December 2018, we announced our inten-\ntion to distribute at least 50% of net income to shareholders in \n2019 and 2020. \n\nWe also announced that the Board of Directors approved a buy-\nback of Group ordinary shares of up to CHF\xc2\xa01.5 billion for 2019 \nand that we anticipate to buy back at least CHF\xc2\xa01 billion of shares \nthis year, subject to market and economic conditions. In addition, \nwe said that we would expect a similar buyback program in 2020, \nsubject to approval by the Board of Directors. We are pleased to \ninform you that we have effectively started our buyback program \nfor 2019. As of March 7, 2019, we repurchased 21.3 million \nshares, worth CHF\xc2\xa0261 million.\n\nFinally, at the same 2018 Investor Day, we informed you, our \nshareholders, that we expect to generate a sustainable ordinary \ndividend and to increase it by at least 5% per annum. At the pre-\nsentation of our full year and fourth quarter 2018 results in Feb-\nruary 2019, we told the market that the Board of Directors will \npropose to shareholders at our Annual General Meeting on April \n26, 2019 a distribution of CHF\xc2\xa00.2625 per share out of capital \ncontribution reserves for the financial year 2018. The distribu-\ntion will be free of Swiss withholding tax and will not be subject to \nincome tax for Swiss resident individuals holding the shares as a \nprivate investment. The distribution will be payable in cash.\n\nWe are pleased that the Group is now on a strong footing and in \na position to deliver tangible returns to our shareholders through \nthe return of capital, following the completion of our restructuring \nand the continued execution of our successful strategy.\n\nWith a much reduced cost base, focusing now on produc-\ntivity gains and investment \nThanks to our focus on costs and on our strategic approach to \ncost management, we were able to exceed our target for the \nreduction of our adjusted* operating cost base, which stood at \nCHF\xc2\xa016.5 billion in 2018, at the end our restructuring program, \nCHF\xc2\xa00.5 billion below our target of less than CHF\xc2\xa017 billion. \nSince the end of 2015 we have recorded cumulative net cost \nsavings of CHF\xc2\xa04.6 billion, exceeding our target of a reduction \nof greater than CHF\xc2\xa04.2 billion. All these costs are measured at \nconstant foreign exchange rates fixed at the end of 2015 to pro-\nvide transparency and to allow our shareholders to monitor the \neffectiveness of our cost program during the Group\xe2\x80\x99s restructur-\ning. A significant proportion of our sustainable cost savings was \nachieved through strategic decisions about our portfolio of busi-\nnesses, a number of which were exited or reduced in scale. At \nthe same time we have made substantial investments, focusing \nin particular on risk and compliance, within our corporate func-\ntions, as well as rebuilding our equities franchise with a number of \nsenior hires. Talent management has remained an essential focus \nduring the restructuring as a part of our efforts to ensure we have \nthe right people in the right roles across our business.\n\nAs we said at our 2018 Investor Day, we have effectively trans-\nformed our cost base, and we are pleased with the gains we have \nmade in returning the Group to efficiency. \n\nWe expect to continue operating efficiently in 2019 and beyond, \nas is standard practice for any business. We will continue to allo-\ncate capital to the divisions that we expect will deliver recurring \nrevenues by seeking to invest in talent, subject to market and \neconomic conditions, and further transforming our technology \nthrough digitalization, robotics and automation.\n\nStronger capital position with significantly lower risk\nWe substantially strengthened our capital position in 2018 as \nwe exceeded our targets for common equity tier 1 (CET1) and \nleverage ratios. We delivered a CET1 ratio of 12.6% and a Tier 1 \nleverage ratio of 5.2%\n\nThese capital and leverage ratios are already above the levels \nprescribed by the Swiss requirements that enter into force in \n2020. In addition, and most importantly, we have strengthened \nour business by significantly reducing the Group\xe2\x80\x99s risk manage-\nment value-at-risk since 2015. \n\nAlso, our US intermediate holding company completed its first \npublic Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review stress test in \n2018, with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Sys-\ntem not objecting to the company\xe2\x80\x99s 2018 capital plan. \n\n6\n\nMessage from the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nGiven the uncertain macro-economic environment over the last \nthree years, these achievements underscore both the balance \nand resilience of our new operating model. \n\nCompleted the wind down of legacy assets\nAt the same time as growing our revenues and reducing costs, \nwe have reduced the overall level of risk at Credit Suisse and \ndealt effectively with our key legacy issues. \n\nThe Strategic Resolution Unit (SRU), which we set up in 2015 \nto help us dispose of and de-risk our legacy positions, closed on \nschedule at the end of 2018. It recorded an adjusted* loss before \ntaxes of CHF\xc2\xa01.2 billion for the year, down from CHF\xc2\xa02.9 billion \nin 2016. The residual portfolio has been transferred to the Asset \nResolution Unit and will be separately disclosed within the Corpo-\nrate Center as of January 1, 2019. The closure of the SRU was a \nkey milestone in the completion of our restructuring program. \n\nEmbedding a culture of compliance \nOne of the key goals we set ourselves at the start of the restruc-\nturing program was to significantly upgrade our risk and compli-\nance controls and improve our culture. Regulation has changed \nthe face of banking over the last decade and we believe in these \nchanges and embrace them fully. We have aligned ourselves, as \nan organization, to the rules and regulations across the jurisdic-\ntions in which we operate, making our operations more resilient \nand our business stronger. In September 2018, FINMA said it \nhad identified deficiencies in Credit Suisse AG\xe2\x80\x99s anti-money laun-\ndering due diligence obligations as well as shortcomings in our \ncontrol mechanisms and risk management. We have continuously \nenhanced our compliance and control framework over the last \nthree years \xe2\x80\x93 independent of this review. FINMA acknowledged \nthe numerous proactive measures we have adopted since the end \nof 2015 to strengthen our compliance procedures. As a further \nmeasure, the Group took a decisive step in the fourth quarter \nof 2018 to enhance its compliance oversight at the Board level \nthrough the establishment of a new Board committee. The Con-\nduct and Financial Crime Control Committee became effective in \nearly 2019 and assumes responsibility for the supervision of the \nGroup\xe2\x80\x99s financial crime compliance programs and related conduct \nand ethics initiatives. We believe the set-up of this new Board \ncommittee, combined with the many improvements implemented \nand continuous efforts by management, firmly signals the Group\xe2\x80\x99s \ncommitment to rigorously address financial crime risk and ensure \nthat the highest standards of conduct and vigilance are main-\ntained throughout the Group.\n\nIn February 2019, we made a series of changes to our Group \nExecutive Board to reflect the quality of talent available at Credit \nSuisse. Among these was the appointment of Lara Warner to the \nrole of Group Chief Risk Officer. Lara was previously the Group\xe2\x80\x99s \nChief Compliance & Regulatory Officer, a position that was cre-\nated in 2015 when we set up our Compliance and Regulatory \nAffairs function. Lara\xe2\x80\x99s contribution to the Executive Board and \nGroup over the past three years has been outstanding, as she \nhas overseen the development of industry leading compliance \n\ncapabilities in an area crucial to our growth strategy. She has cre-\nated a modern, technology-enabled compliance organization with \ncutting-edge tools that aim to identify and detect threats across \nour entire platform while also engaging in efforts to strengthen \nrelationships with our key regulators around the world.\n\nWe also announced that Lydie Hudson has been appointed to \nthe role of Chief Compliance Officer, joining the Group Execu-\ntive Board. Lydie has been with the firm for eleven years, serving \nmost recently as Chief Operating Officer of GM; she has been \ninstrumental in reshaping of the division during the restructuring \nperiod. At the same time, Antoinette Poschung was appointed as \nGlobal Head of Human Resources, joining the Group Executive \nBoard. Since joining Credit Suisse in 2008, Antoinette has played \na key role in talent development across the organization as well as \nheading a number of Human Resources functions for the Group. \n\nOur compliance and regulatory affairs function has now been split \ngiven the growing importance of our relationship with regulators. \nRegulatory Affairs has been integrated into the CEO office, and \nthe Global Head of Regulatory Affairs will continue maintaining \nclose interaction with our key regulators around the world.\n\nFinally, as part of our restructuring program, we have invested \nsignificantly in upgrading our compliance and control frameworks. \nWe increased our headcount in compliance by over 40% over \nthe last three years. We also completed a significant review of \nover 30,000 legacy clients and over 10,000 control issues and \nimprovements were implemented across the Group. We used cut-\nting edge technology, as previously mentioned, to move from 12 \nlegacy platforms to one strategic platform. Since late 2015, we \nhave rolled out new compliance tools Group-wide, including our \nSingle Client View which now covers 99% of our wealth manage-\nment clients. Additionally, we rolled out Trader Holistic Surveil-\nlance covering all traders globally and Relationship Manager \nHolistic Surveillance covering approximately 80% of relationship \nmanagers. \n\nBanks propel global economic activity\nThroughout our restructuring, we remained acutely conscious of \nour purpose and role as a global financial services group. Banks \nplay an integral role in the local, regional and global economies. \nWe are where people should turn to for safety, trust and reliability. \nWe are meant to offer individuals and companies the comfort of \ndepositing savings safely, to manage their payments securely and \nto act as financial intermediaries, connectors across markets and \neconomies, bringing borrowers and lenders together, being the \ncatalysts for opportunity and growth. \n\nAs banks, we have a duty to our communities and societies as \nour businesses and activities are often intertwined, even deeply \nrooted, in the prosperity of others. As a result, Credit Suisse \nalways strives to carry out all its activities in accordance with clear \nprinciples and values \xe2\x80\x93 particularly our commitment to operating \nresponsibly and with integrity in the interests of our stakeholders. \n\nMessage from the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer\n\n7\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nIn 2017, we announced the establishment of Impact Advisory \nand Finance (IAF), a department that aims to facilitate projects \nand initiatives for clients that have a positive economic and social \nimpact, while generating a financial return. IAF is generating sig-\nnificant momentum across both wealth management as well as \ncorporate and investment banking. The department has success-\nfully helped seed impact investing funds in several parts of the \nworld, partnered with the world\xe2\x80\x99s leading international organiza-\ntions working on furthering investment in this space, and contin-\nues to drive our international green finance underwriting efforts. \n\nOutlook\nWe experienced widespread volatility and lower client activity \nlevels across the market in 2018, particularly in the second half. \nLooking at 2019, while sentiment did improve slightly at the start \nof the year, as signs of normalization returned to both equity and \ndebt markets, investor concerns continue to weigh on the envi-\nronment and a cautious approach to investing prevails. \n\nThe uncertain political climate in a number of major world econo-\nmies as well as potential disruptions to world trade continue to be \nclear concerns. However, with our lower cost base, the reduc-\ntion of our exposure to risk, our flexible and diversified model and \nthe benefits flowing from the closure of our SRU, we expect to \nremain resilient in the face of strong headwinds and believe we \nare well positioned to take advantage of any potential upside.\n\nLooking to the future of Credit Suisse in 2019 and beyond, we \nbelieve that the Group will benefit greatly from its position post-\nrestructuring and from its strategic focus on wealth management \ncombined with strong investment banking capabilities. Our target \nis\xc2\xa0to achieve a Group reported return on tangible equity of between \n10% and 11% for 2019 and between 11% and 12% for 2020, \nassuming a flat revenue environment and capitalizing on factors \nunder our control. We aim to achieve higher returns with  continued \nrevenue growth in our Wealth Management-related businesses \nand IBCM, cost efficiencies and lower funding costs, as well as by \nselect strategic investments, subject to market conditions. \n\nWe are now, more than ever before, well positioned to take \nadvantage of a number of macro trends that we believe will \nremain supportive over the long term. We believe that global \nwealth will continue to grow; entrepreneurs will continue to require \nthe services of our leading investment banking franchise; Switzer-\nland will remain an attractive banking market; sales and trading \nrevenue pools will continue to stagnate or decline worldwide; and \nboth emerging and mature markets will offer attractive growth \ndynamics over the long term. \n\nAt the conclusion of our restructuring, we would like to thank our \nteam of close to 46,000 employees worldwide for their hard work \nand commitment throughout this period of transformation. We \ncould not have delivered on our goals and objectives without their \ndedication, effort and time. We would also like to express our \nthanks to our clients and shareholders for their continued trust \nand support over the last three years and into the future.\n\nBest regards\n\nUrs Rohner\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0  Tidjane Thiam\nChairman of the\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0  Chief Executive Officer\nBoard of Directors\n\nMarch 2019\n\n1  Source: Dealogic data (Americas and EMEA) for the period ending December 31, 2018.\n2  Source: Dealogic data (Global) for the period ending December 31, 2018.\n\nImportant Information\n*   Adjusted results are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain items included in our reported results.

Together with Tidjane \nThiam who assembled a new manage-\nment team, we embarked on an ambitious \nplan to fundamentally alter the structure \nand activities of Credit Suisse \xe2\x80\x93 right down \nto the individual businesses. As a global \nbank with more than 48,000 employees in \n2015 and operations in over 50 countries, \nthat was no small undertaking. I think we \nhave every reason to be satisfied with \nwhat we have achieved over the last few \nyears. Credit Suisse is today a very differ-\nent bank to when we started that journey \nand is certainly a great deal more resilient.\n\nCEO: I am pleased for our colleagues as \nthey are now starting to see the tangible \nresults of their hard work. The last few \nyears were an intense period for us all, and \nwe faced many headwinds along the way. \nAt the start of the restructuring process \nin 2015, we identified the most pressing \nproblems we had to tackle. We wanted to \nachieve sustainable, compliant and profit-\nable growth \xe2\x80\x93 shifting our focus to wealth \nmanagement and leveraging our strong \ninvestment banking capabilities. It was also \nimperative for us to reduce both risks and \ncosts as well as substantially strengthen \nour balance sheet. We had significant \nlegacy issues to address, and we needed \nto upgrade our risk and compliance capa-\nbilities. We can say that, after three years \nof continuous effort, we have broadly \nachieved these objectives. That is a satis-\nfying outcome for all of us at the bank, not \nto mention our clients and shareholders.\n\nCredit Suisse recently announced new \nappointments to the Executive Board \nand senior leadership team. Can you \nexplain the reasons for these changes \n\xe2\x80\x93 and why they are being made at this \npoint in time?\n\nCEO: The organisational structure we \nestablished in 2015 has worked well, pro-\nducing strong results in our three regionally-\nfocused businesses \xe2\x80\x93 Swiss Universal Bank \n\n(SUB), International Wealth Management \n(IWM) and Asia Pacific Wealth Manage-\nment & Connected \xe2\x80\x93 in terms of revenue \nand profit growth, with approximately \nCHF\xc2\xa0100 billion of Wealth Management \nnet new assets acquired over three years. \nWith the transformation of Credit Suisse \nnow complete, we are ready to move into \nthe next phase of our development and are \ntaking the necessary steps to prepare for \nit. In February 2019, we made a number of \nnew appointments to functional roles on the \nExecutive Board and in our senior leader-\nship team. It is very important for us to be \nsuccessful in this post restructuring phase \nwe are entering, and we want to ensure \nthat our Group corporate functions are well \naligned with our model as they support and \ninteract with our divisions both in terms of \neffectiveness and efficiency. The recent \nchanges will ensure we continue to make \nprogress on that journey of improvement.\n\nChairman: The Board of Directors \napproved these appointments and fully \nsupports the organizational changes, \nwhich should allow us to make continued \nprogress on our journey of improvement. \nIn particular, they are designed to ensure \nthat key Group corporate functions \xe2\x80\x93 Risk, \nCompliance, Human Resources, Regula-\ntory Affairs and Investor Relations, Corpo-\nrate Communications, Marketing & Brand-\ning \xe2\x80\x93 are better aligned with our strategic \nmodel so they can interact with the busi-\nnesses and support them as efficiently \nand effectively as possible. Overall, the \nGroup corporate functions are instrumen-\ntal in helping us to make the right decision \nfor our business as we work towards our \nlong-term goals. \n\nHow would you rate Credit Suisse\xe2\x80\x99s \nperformance in 2018? Which areas of \nthe business did especially well? \n\nCEO: We performed well in 2018. With \nCHF\xc2\xa03.37 billion of Group reported pre-\ntax income in 2018, our income rose by \n88% year on year. Net income attribut-\nable to shareholders was CHF\xc2\xa02.02 bil-\nlion \xe2\x80\x93 marking our first annual post-tax \nprofit since 2014. Many of our businesses \nare achieving strong, profitable, com-\npliant growth, especially in our wealth \nmanagement-focused divisions SUB, IWM \n\nand Asia Pacific (APAC). We attracted \nCHF\xc2\xa034.4 billion of Wealth Management \nnet new assets in 2018 alone, with net \ninflows reported each quarter. SUB saw \na further acceleration in its profitability \nin 2018, with adjusted* pre-tax income \ngrowth of 18% to CHF\xc2\xa02.2 billion. In IWM, \nwe outperformed our closest peers in all \nour markets, exceeding our adjusted pre-\ntax income target of CHF\xc2\xa01.8 billion. I was \nsatisfied with the results of our APAC divi-\nsion, given the significant market disloca-\ntion we saw towards the end of the year. \nOur performance in that region shows \nall the value of our innovative integrated \nmodel delivering private banking, invest-\nment banking and financing services to \nour clients. We also made considerable \nprogress in Investment Banking & Capital \nMarkets (IBCM), and in Global Markets \n(GM), which has demonstrated strict \nresource and risk discipline in a challeng-\ning environment. \n\nHow do you explain the disappoint-\ning performance of the Credit Suisse \nshare price over the past 12\xc2\xa0months? \nDo you view this as part of a broader \ntrend affecting European financials?\n\nChairman: \nIndeed, our share price and the bank-\ning sector as a whole have suffered major \nlosses. Of course, this is anything but \npleasing, whether for shareholders, the \nmanagement team or other employees \nwho would like to see their performance \nreflected in the value of the company \nand who are also partly paid in shares. \nHowever, we must bear in mind that our \nshare price was impacted by a number of \nforces which were prevalent across the \nEuropean banking landscape, and mar-\nkets as a whole, for most of 2018. With \nthe improvements in profitability manage-\nment has achieved, we are confident that \nreturns for the Group can continue to \nimprove in 2019 and in the future, sub-\nject to market conditions, and should be \nreflected in a higher share price over time. \nWe expect that in 2019, our sharehold-\ners should begin to see the benefits of the \nrestructuring \xe2\x80\x93 both through the antici-\npated return of capital and aimed increase \nin tangible book value per share as capital \ngeneration strengthens. \n\nInterview with the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer\n\n9\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nOn the subject of returning capital to \nshareholders, can you explain the rea-\nson for the buyback you announced in \nDecember 2018?\n\nCEO: At the end of last year, the Board \nof Directors approved a share buyback \nprogramme of Group ordinary shares of \nup to CHF\xc2\xa01.5 billion in 2019 because we \nare committed to returning capital to our \nshareholders. Credit Suisse began repur-\nchasing shares in January, and we expect \nto repurchase at least CHF\xc2\xa01.0 billion this \nyear, subject to market and economic \nconditions. Buybacks are core to satisfy-\ning our commitment to shareholders. Our \nfocus is on generating capital and then to \ndistribute at least 50% of net income to \nshareholders. The reason we favour share \nbuybacks over dividends is they give the \ncompany greater flexibility and will allow \nus to reduce some of the dilution that \noccurred due to previous capital increases, \nwhich were indispensable to eliminate \nour legacy issues, restructure the Group \nand return to growth, but were costly for \nshareholders.\n\nIs your Swiss home market still as \nimportant for Credit Suisse in 2019 \nas it was in the past? How Swiss is \ntoday\xe2\x80\x99s Credit Suisse?\n\nChairman: Yes, absolutely. Switzer-\nland is our home. Our Swiss roots are \nreflected in our name, and they are just as \nimportant today as they were when Alfred \nEscher established the bank more than \n160 years ago. Our decision to create \nthe Swiss Universal Bank division back in \n2015 underscores our strong commitment \nto this market, and it is today the largest \ncontributor to our profits. If you consider \nthat around one in five people and over \n100,000 businesses in Switzerland bank \nwith Credit Suisse, and we have more \nthan CHF\xc2\xa0160 billion of loans outstand-\ning to Swiss clients, it shows the close ties \nbetween our bank and the Swiss econ-\nomy. Let\xe2\x80\x99s not forget that we are also one \nof the country\xe2\x80\x99s largest employers, with \n15,840 members of our workforce based \nhere. I would also say that compared to \nother international companies based in \nSwitzerland, Credit Suisse is a very Swiss \n\ninstitution. One-third of the members of \nour Executive Board are Swiss and a sig-\nnificant proportion of them reside here in \nSwitzerland. We have always made sure \nthat overall, the Board of Directors retains \nits Swiss nature. In short, our strategy and \nour ambitions for our Swiss home market \nremain unchanged.\n\nCEO: I have always believed that in busi-\nness, like in sport, it is crucially important \nto be able to \xe2\x80\x98win at home\xe2\x80\x99. Creating our \nSwiss Universal Bank and emphasising the \nimportance of Switzerland was an integral \npart of my vision for Credit Suisse. Being \nnamed \xe2\x80\x98Best Bank in Switzerland\xe2\x80\x99 both by \n\xe2\x80\x98The Banker\xe2\x80\x99 magazine and by Euromoney \nis something we set out to achieve and of \nwhich we are all very proud.\n\nAt the start of the restructuring, you \nunderscored the scale of the wealth \nmanagement opportunity in Asia. Do \nyou still believe the region offers the \nsame potential?\n\nCEO: I actually underscored the scale of \nthe opportunity both in mature economies \nlike Switzerland, where we have effec-\ntively been able to grow since 2015, and \nin emerging economies in general, which \nincludes Asia, yes, but also Latin America, \nthe Middle East and Eastern Europe. \nFocusing on Asia for a moment, it is worth \nnoting that in 2018, the Asia region had \naround 800 billionaires, an increase of \naround one-third from the prior year. That \nis a staggering pace of growth \xe2\x80\x93 and yet \nthe private banking market in Asia is still \nin its infancy. The total volume of wealth in \nour target segment \xe2\x80\x93 ultra-high-net worth \nclients and entrepreneurs \xe2\x80\x93 is estimated at \naround USD\xc2\xa05,000 billion. At present, as \ndemonstrated by our 2018 results, Credit \nSuisse is a leader in wealth management \nin Asia, ranking third in Asia in terms of \nassets under management, but we still \nhave only a small percentage of the poten-\ntial market. I see three ways of growing \nour business in the region. First, our exist-\ning clients are becoming ever wealthier, \nwhich means our recurring revenue from \nmanaging their assets should increase. \nSecond, we can grow our market share \nwith each client \xe2\x80\x93 often by offering them \n\n10\n\nInterview with the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer\n\nsolutions to specific opportunities they \nsee or challenges they face. And third, \nwe hope that a good proportion of these \nnew billionaires that are emerging will be \nattracted by what Credit Suisse can do \nfor them. That\xe2\x80\x99s not to say that we didn\xe2\x80\x99t \nsee challenges across the Asian markets \nin 2018, with trade tensions and other \nmacro issues impacting client sentiment \nand risk appetite. However, we continue to \nbelieve in the long term attractiveness of \nthe region.\n\nYou recently proposed the election of \na new Board member from Asia, Shan \nLi. What kind of insights into the Asia \nregion do you hope to gain from him? \nAnd with regard to the second new \nBoard member, Christian Gellerstad, \nwhere do you seek to leverage his \nexpertise and experience?\n\nChairman: I believe both Board members \nwill ideally complement the strengths of \nthe Board with their excellent capabili-\nties and will contribute their expertise to \nthe future development of our strategy. \nShan Li has an excellent track record in \nthe financial services industry \xe2\x80\x93 especially \nin the Chinese market, which is of key \nimportance for Credit Suisse. In China, \nthe focus is shifting from industry and \nmanufacturing goods to consumption and \nservices. The healthcare and Information \nTechnology sectors are booming, and we \ncan see plenty of potential for our strat-\negy of being the global \xe2\x80\x9cBank for Entre-\npreneurs\xe2\x80\x9d for our onshore China clients. \nWe are positioning our franchise for an \neventual full China market opening, and \nwe expect Shan Li\xe2\x80\x99s experience will be a \nsignificant benefit as we move towards this \ngoal. Christian Gellerstad is a well-rec-\nognized wealth management expert. His \nmore than two decades of industry experi-\nence and leadership expertise in running \na private banking business in mature and \ndeveloping markets should make him ide-\nally positioned to support our growth initia-\ntives in wealth management. \n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nWhat would you describe as the key \ningredients of a successful client rela-\ntionship? How is this changing as a \nresult of digitalization?\n\nChairman: I think trust is the most vital \ningredient for a successful client relation-\nship. In fact, our entire business works \non the basis of trust. Our clients entrust \nus with their assets and turn to us for \nadvice because they have confidence in \nour financial expertise and our ability to \ndeliver good performance, as well as in our \nfinancial solidity and resilience as a bank. \nAt the same time, we know that for many \nof our clients, reputation is as important \nas performance in their choice of financial \npartner. We therefore work according to \nclear conduct and ethics standards and \nexpect our employees to act responsi-\nbly and with integrity under any circum-\nstances. Last year, Credit Suisse attracted \nover CHF\xc2\xa056 billion of net new assets. I \nsee that as clear evidence of the trust that \nclients around the globe place in Credit \nSuisse.\n\nCEO: I agree that we must earn our cli-\nents\xe2\x80\x99 trust day after day to build strong \nrelationships with them. I also believe that \nwe must strive to be a professional and \nreliable partner and deliver our full range \nof expertise to them \xe2\x80\x93 whether it is by \nproviding the best possible investment \nadvice, ensuring best execution of their \ntransactions or protecting and growing \ntheir assets. Naturally, we also have to \nkeep pace with their changing needs. With \nthe advance of technology, we are seeing \na tectonic shift in what individual clients \nwant and expect from us. For example, \nmillennials drastically differ from previous \ngenerations of clients in their consumer \nbehavior. They are technology natives and \nare purpose-driven. They are demand-\ning faster and more convenient access to \nour services via their preferred channels, \nand they want banking to be truly mobile. \nIn response, we are continuing to develop \nand expand our digital offering along the \nclient lifecycle and are creating user inter-\nfaces and consumer touch points that \nmake sense for them. Anticipating and \nacting on our clients\xe2\x80\x99 changing needs is \nunquestionably a key part of being a suc-\ncessful financial partner.\n\nCredit Suisse has underscored its \nefforts to resolve legacy issues and to \nimplement a robust compliance and \ncontrol framework, as well as bring-\ning about a change of culture within \nthe Group. Which concrete steps have \nyou taken? What role does the Board \nof Directors play in influencing our \ncorporate culture? \n\nChairman: Resolving legacy issues and \nupgrading our compliance and control \nframework with enhanced processes were \nintegral parts of the restructuring process. \nWe also said that we wanted to transform \nthe Group\xe2\x80\x99s culture. We have delivered \non these objectives through a series of \ntargeted measures. Let me give you a \ncouple of examples: First, to build a culture \nof integrity and fairness, we recognized \nthe need to have a single set of values \nfor employees across all our businesses \nand regions. We therefore launched our \nGroup-wide Conduct and Ethics Stan-\ndards, which promote a shared under-\nstanding and expectations in terms of our \nvalues and conduct. Naturally, our Code of \nConduct, which is endorsed by the Board \nof Directors and Executive Board, and is \nbinding for all employees as well as Board \nmembers, is of key importance in this \ncontext. Second, in terms of reinforcing \ncompliance, Credit Suisse fully embraced \nthe regulatory and legislative changes \nthat were introduced over the last decade \nto remedy the industry\xe2\x80\x99s shortcomings. \nToday, our Compliance unit operates as \nan independent Executive Board-level \nfunction, underscoring its high level of \nimportance within Credit Suisse. As part \nof the organizational changes I mentioned \nbefore, the Regulatory Affairs function \nnow reports directly to the CEO \xe2\x80\x93 reflect-\ning the growing importance of our relation-\nship with regulators. In addition, in early \n2019, the Board of Directors established \nthe Conduct and Financial Crime Control \nCommittee to monitor and assess the \neffectiveness of our financial crime com-\npliance programs and initiatives that are \nfocused on further improving conduct and \nvigilance as part of our efforts to combat \nfinancial crime and firmly embed a strong \ncompliance culture in the Group. \n\nCredit Suisse is today placing a strong \nemphasis on sustainable finance and \nimpact investing \xe2\x80\x93 why is this area so \nimportant to you? \n\nCEO: Because it is simply the right thing \nto do. It is therefore not surprising that \nthere has been a notable increase in the \ndemand for sustainable and impact invest-\ning products in recent years as more and \nmore investors seek ways of using their \ncapital to have a positive impact on the \nworld while also producing a financial \nreturn. Credit Suisse has been active in \nthis space for more than a decade, and \nwe are working hard to meet this growing \ndemand. In 2017, I established the Impact \nAdvisory & Finance (IAF) department, \nwhich reports directly to me. It aims to \nfacilitate projects and initiatives for clients \nthat have a positive economic and social \nimpact while delivering financial returns. \nIAF generated significant momentum \nacross both wealth management and cor-\nporate and investment banking in 2018. \nIt is also playing a part in codifying this \nrelatively new but rapidly growing sector. \nThrough these activities, we can contribute \nto the development of the global economy \nand support social progress and environ-\nmental sustainability. These are topics that \nare important to me. \n\nTechnology has already transformed \nmuch of what Credit Suisse does. \nIn which areas do you expect to see \nthe greatest technological benefits in \nthe coming years? What are the main \ncyber risks facing the industry and \nwhat steps are you taking to protect \nCredit Suisse and its clients?\n\nChairman: Technology catalyzes disrup-\ntive change and drives progress in our \nindustry. That is why, in 2015, the Board \nestablished an Innovation and Technology \nCommittee, an interdisciplinary advisory \ngroup to discuss the progress we are mak-\ning at Credit Suisse in terms of innova-\ntion and technology initiatives as well as to \nconsider industry-wide technology trends. \nThe Group\xe2\x80\x99s leadership regularly examines \nthe role that innovation and technology will \nplay in the future of banking, and how we \ncan most effectively deploy them across \nour divisions. In the coming years, I expect \n\nInterview with the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer\n\n11\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\non Latin America, to name a few. These \ndevelopments are especially challeng-\ning due to their potential adverse impact \non investor confidence and client activity \nlevels. The continuation of the ultra-low \ninterest rate environment in many coun-\ntries also places a burden on our business. \nNevertheless, I am confident that Credit \nSuisse can remain resilient in the face of \nthese pressures thanks to our lower cost \nbase, reduced risk exposures, our flexible \nand diversified business model and the \nbenefits flowing from the closure of our \nStrategic Resolution Unit. And, of course, \nwe are well positioned to take advantage \nof any potential upside going forward. \n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0\n\nto see an uptick in the use of technological \ninnovations in banking, leveraging amongst \nmuch else the cloud, distributed ledger, \nautomation, robotics and machine-learning \nas well as data science more generally. Of \ncourse, rapid technological development \nalso brings new challenges, for example \nin the field of cybersecurity, which will be \na serious concern across our industry for \nthe foreseeable future. Regulators and \ncompanies are working to understand how \nbest to protect banks\xe2\x80\x99 data and the integ-\nrity of the financial services ecosystem. \nWe continue to invest significantly in our \ninformation and cybersecurity programs, \nand we regularly assess the effectiveness \nof our key controls. In addition, we rou-\ntinely conduct employee training to embed \na mature cyber risk management culture \nwithin the organization. \n\n2019 marks the 200th anniversary of \nthe birth of Credit Suisse\xe2\x80\x99s founder \nAlfred Escher.  What do you find most \ninspiring about him? To what extent is \nhis vision of entrepreneurship still rel-\nevant today?\n\nChairman: What I find most inspiring \nabout Alfred Escher is his incredible entre-\npreneurial spirit and his desire to bring \nabout lasting change \xe2\x80\x93 benefiting the \neconomy and society. In the 19th century, \nEscher almost single-handedly developed \n\npart of the infrastructure of modern Swit-\nzerland, including its rail network and the \nfamous Gotthard tunnel. And of course, \nhe founded Credit Suisse in 1856 to raise \ncapital for his infrastructure projects. I am \ninspired by the courage he showed in pur-\nsuing his vision at a time when many of his \nideas were met with skepticism. He was \nrelentless in his efforts to drive progress \nand prosperity. Today, Escher still inspires \nus with his foresight and determination to \nmake things happen. What we can learn \nfrom his vision of entrepreneurship is the \nimportance of anticipating future trends, \nhaving the courage of your convictions and \nthinking creatively to formulate innovative \nsolutions. A portrait of our founder hangs \nin the boardroom here at our head office \nin Zurich and is a constant reminder of his \ngreat\xc2\xa0legacy. \n\nWhat do you expect to be the greatest \nchallenges for Credit Suisse in 2019?\n\nCEO: I believe the main headwinds we \nwill face in 2019 relate to heightened \nglobal geopolitical and macroeconomic \nuncertainties. These include the potential \ndisruptions to world trade due to tensions \nbetween the US and China and other \nuncertainties in the world whether it is the \nsituation in the Middle East in general, the \nUK\xe2\x80\x99s anticipated withdrawal from the EU \nor the impact of the situation in Venezuela \n\n*  Adjusted results are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain items included in our reported results.

We seek to follow a balanced approach with our \nwealth management activities, aiming to capitalize on both the large pool of wealth within mature markets as well as the signifi-\ncant growth in wealth in Asia Pacific and other emerging markets. Founded in 1856, we today have a global reach with opera-\ntions in about 50 countries and 45,680 employees from over 150 different nations. Our broad footprint helps us to generate a \n geographically  balanced stream of revenues and net new assets and allows us to capture growth opportunities around the world. \nWe serve our clients through three regionally focused divisions: Swiss Universal Bank, International Wealth Management and Asia \nPacific. These regional businesses are supported by two other divisions specializing in investment banking capabilities: Global \n Markets and  Investment  Banking & Capital Markets. The Strategic Resolution Unit consolidated the remaining portfolios from the \nformer non- strategic units plus additional businesses and positions that did not fit with our strategic direction. Our business divisions \ncooperate closely to provide holistic financial solutions, including innovative products and specially tailored advice.\n\n \nSwiss  \nUniversal Bank\n\n International \nWealth \nManagement\n\n \nAsia  \nPacific\n\nThe Swiss Universal Bank division \noffers comprehensive advice and a \nwide range of financial solutions to pri-\nvate, corporate and institutional clients \nprimarily domiciled in our home market \nSwitzerland, which offers attractive \ngrowth opportunities and where we can \nbuild on a strong market position across \nour key businesses. Our Private  Clients \nbusiness has a leading franchise in \nour Swiss home market and serves \nultra-high-net-worth individual, high-\nnet-worth individual, affluent and retail \nclients. Our Corporate & Institutional \nClients business serves large corporate \nclients, small and medium-sized enter-\nprises, institutional clients, external \nasset managers, financial institutions \nand commodity traders.\n\nThe International Wealth Management \ndivision through its Private Banking \nbusiness offers comprehensive advisory \nservices and tailored investment and \nfinancing solutions to wealthy private \nclients and external asset managers \nin Europe, the Middle East, Africa and \nLatin America, utilizing comprehensive \naccess to the broad spectrum of Credit \nSuisse\xe2\x80\x99s global resources and capa-\nbilities as well as a wide range of pro-\nprietary and third-party products and \nservices. Our Asset Management busi-\nness offers investment solutions and \nservices globally to a broad range of cli-\nents, including pension funds, govern-\nments, foundations and endowments, \ncorporations and individuals.\n\nIn the Asia Pacific division, our wealth \nmanagement, financing and underwrit-\ning and advisory teams work closely \ntogether to deliver integrated advisory \nservices and solutions to our target \nultra-high-net-worth, entrepreneur and \ncorporate clients. Our Wealth Manage-\nment & Connected business combines \nour activities in wealth management \nwith our financing, underwriting and \nadvisory activities. Our Markets busi-\nness represents our equities and fixed \nincome sales and trading businesses, \nwhich support our wealth management \nactivities, but also deals extensively \nwith a broader range of institutional \nclients. \n\n14\n\nCredit Suisse at a glance\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\n \nGlobal  \nMarkets\n\nInvestment \nBanking & \nCapital Markets\n\nStrategic \nResolution  \nUnit\n\nThe Global Markets division offers a \nbroad range of financial products and \nservices to client-driven businesses and \nalso supports Credit Suisse\xe2\x80\x99s global \nwealth management businesses and \ntheir clients. Our suite of products and \nservices includes global securities sales, \ntrading and execution, prime broker-\nage and comprehensive investment \nresearch. Our clients include financial \ninstitutions, corporations, governments, \ninstitutional investors, such as pension \nfunds and hedge funds, and private \nindividuals around the world.\n\nThe Investment Banking & Capital \nMarkets division offers a broad range \nof investment banking services to cor-\nporations, financial institutions, finan-\ncial sponsors and ultra-high-net-worth \nindividuals and sovereign clients. Our \nrange of products and services includes \nadvisory services related to mergers \nand acquisitions, divestitures, takeover \ndefense mandates, business restruc-\nturings and spin-offs. The division also \nengages in debt and equity underwrit-\ning of public securities offerings and \nprivate placements.\n\nThe Strategic Resolution Unit was \n created to facilitate the immediate \nright-sizing of our business divisions \nfrom a capital perspective and included \nremaining portfolios from former non-\nstrategic units plus transfers of addi-\ntional exposures from the business \ndivisions. The unit\xe2\x80\x99s primary focus was \non facilitating the rapid wind-down \nof capital usage and costs to reduce \nthe negative impact on the Group\xe2\x80\x99s \nperformance. Repositioned as a \nseparate division, this provided clearer \naccountability, governance and report-\ning. Beginning in 2019, the Strategic \n Resolution Unit has ceased to exist as \na separate division of the Group. \n\nCredit Suisse at a glance\n\n15\n\n\x0c \n\nStrategy\n\n \n\nCredit Suisse strategy\n\nOur strategy is to be a leading wealth manager with strong invest-\nment banking capabilities. \n\nWe believe wealth management is one of the most attractive seg-\nments in banking. Global wealth has grown significantly over the \nlast ten years and is projected to continue to grow faster than \nGDP over the next several years, with both emerging markets \nand mature markets offering attractive growth opportunities. We \nseek to follow a balanced approach with our wealth management \nactivities, aiming to capitalize on both the large pool of wealth \nwithin mature markets as well as the significant growth in wealth \nin Asia Pacific and other emerging markets.\n\nIn the wealth management sector, we expect that emerging mar-\nkets will account for nearly 60% of the growth in global wealth in \nthe coming years, with more than 60% of that additional wealth \nexpected to be created in Asia Pacific. Wealth is highly concen-\ntrated in emerging markets, with wealth creation mostly tied to \nfirst and second generation entrepreneurs. We believe that posi-\ntioning ourselves as the \xe2\x80\x9cBank for Entrepreneurs\xe2\x80\x9d by leveraging \nour strengths in wealth management and investment banking will \nprovide us with key competitive advantages to succeed in these \nmarkets as we provide clients with a range of services to protect \nand grow their wealth and offer an integrated approach across \ntheir private and corporate financial needs. We are scaling up our \nwealth management franchise in emerging markets by recruiting \nand retaining high-quality relationship managers while prudently \nmanaging our lending exposure, building on our strong investment \nand advisory offering and global investment banking capabilities. \nAt the same time we are investing in our risk management and \ncompliance functions.\n\nDespite slower growth, mature markets are still expected to \nremain important and account for more than half of global wealth \nby 2022. We plan to capitalize on opportunities in markets such \nas Western Europe, with a focused approach to building scale \ngiven the highly competitive environment.\n\nSwitzerland, as our home market, provides compelling opportuni-\nties for Credit Suisse. Switzerland remains the country with the \nhighest average wealth and highest density of affluent clients \nglobally. Switzerland benefits from its highly developed and tradi-\ntionally resilient economy, where many entrepreneurial small and \nmedium-sized enterprises continue to drive strong export perfor-\nmance. We provide a full range of services to private, corporate \nand institutional clients with a specific focus on becoming the \n\xe2\x80\x9cBank for Entrepreneurs\xe2\x80\x9d and plan to further expand our strong \nposition with Swiss private, corporate and institutional clients as \nwell as take advantage of opportunities arising from consolidation.\n\nWe have simplified and de-risked our Global Markets business \nmodel, reducing complexity and cost while continuing to sup-\nport our core institutional client franchises and maintaining strong \npositions in our core franchises. We aim to further strengthen our \n\nInternational Trading Solutions business, our product manufactur-\ning and distribution platform relating to our Global Markets, Swiss \nUniversal Bank and International Wealth Management divisions. \nWe have right-sized our operations and reduced risk in a focused \nway by exiting or downsizing selected businesses consistent with \nour return on capital objectives and lower risk profile. \n\nIn our Investment Banking & Capital Markets division, we have \nfocused on rebalancing our product mix towards advisory and \nequity underwriting while maintaining our leading leveraged \nfinance franchise. Our objective is to align, and selectively invest \nin, our coverage and capital resources with the largest growth \nopportunities and where our franchise is well-positioned. We \nbelieve this will help us to strengthen our market position, con-\ntribute to a revenue mix that is more diversified and less volatile \nthrough the market cycle and achieve returns in excess of our \ncost of capital. We will continue to leverage Investment Banking \n& Capital Markets\xe2\x80\x99 global connectivity with our other divisions and \nits platform to drive opportunities for the Group.\n\nWe intend to continue with a disciplined approach to cost man-\nagement across the Group, focusing on continuous productivity \nimprovements that can release resources for growth investments \nwhile maintaining a strong operating leverage. \n\nCompletion of the three-year restructuring plan\n\nWe have successfully completed our ambitious three-year restruc-\nturing plan outlined at the Investor Day on October 21, 2015. \n\nDelivered profitable growth \nOver the last three years we have rebalanced the allocation \nof capital towards our high-quality and high-returning Wealth \nManagement-related and Investment Banking & Capital Markets \nbusinesses. This has led to a significant shift in our business mix \nwith more than two-thirds of our capital, excluding the Corporate \nCenter and the Strategic Resolution Unit, allocated to our Wealth \nManagement-related and Investment Banking & Capital Markets \nbusinesses. References to our Wealth Management-related busi-\nnesses mean our Swiss Universal Bank division, our International \nWealth Management division and our Wealth Management & \nConnected business within our Asia Pacific division or their com-\nbined results.\n\nSince 2015, we have attracted CHF\xc2\xa0100.9 billion of net new \nassets in Wealth Management, leading to assets under manage-\nment of CHF\xc2\xa0757.2 billion. Our balanced approach in Wealth \nManagement has contributed to positive inflows in mature mar-\nkets as well as strong inflows in emerging markets. Our focus \non growing our entrepreneur and ultra-high-net-worth (UHNW) \nfranchise has been successful with Wealth Management net new \nassets of CHF\xc2\xa034.4 billion in 2018, an increase of 90% since \n2015.

We have grown our Wealth Management-related and \nInvestment Banking & Capital Markets revenues by CHF\xc2\xa02.0 bil-\nlion since 2015, which represents a compound annual growth \nrate of 5%. Our focus on delivering positive operating leverage \nhas continuously driven returns higher in our Wealth Manage-\nment-related and Investment Banking & Capital Markets busi-\nnesses as we have achieved an income before taxes of CHF\xc2\xa04.9 \nbillion in 2018, an increase of 159% since 2015 and adjusted \nincome before taxes of CHF\xc2\xa05.2 billion in 2018, an increase of \n75% since 2015. \n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cWealth Management-related businesses and Investment Banking & \nCapital Markets \xe2\x80\x93 Reconciliation of adjusted results\xe2\x80\x9d for further information.\n\nImproved the resilience of our business model \nA key focus of our strategy has been to make the bank more \nresilient in challenging market conditions while preserving our \nability to benefit when markets are more favorable.\n\nOver the last three years we have significantly lowered the break-\neven point of the Group. In 2015, we announced our strate-\ngic cost transformation program with the aim of reducing our \nadjusted operating cost base measured at constant 2015 foreign \nexchange rates to below CHF\xc2\xa017 billion, in order to achieve net \nsavings of more than CHF\xc2\xa04.2 billion. We successfully completed \nthe program at the end of this year, achieving reported total oper-\nating expenses of CHF\xc2\xa017.3 billion and an adjusted operating cost \nbase of CHF\xc2\xa016.5 billion. \n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cOperating cost base \xe2\x80\x93 Reconciliation of adjusted results\xe2\x80\x9d for further \n\ninformation.\n\nSince 2015, we have substantially lowered the risk profile of our \nbusiness activities. On a Group level we have reduced average \nValue-at-Risk by 41% and reduced level 3 assets by 50%. In our \nGlobal Markets business we have successfully restructured our \nbusiness portfolio while maintaining our core franchise strengths \nand reducing risk-weighted assets and leverage exposure since \nthe third quarter of 2015. \n\nWe have significantly strengthened our capital position since the \nthird quarter of 2015 with look-through common equity tier 1 \n(CET1) capital of CHF\xc2\xa035.9 billion and Tier 1 capital of CHF\xc2\xa046.1 \nbillion as of year-end 2018. Our look-through CET1 ratio has \nincreased from 10.2% in the third quarter of 2015 to 12.6% at \nyear-end 2018 and our look-through Tier 1 leverage ratio has \nincreased from 3.9% in the third quarter of 2015 to 5.2% as of \nyear-end 2018. \n\nIn addition we have established a dedicated compliance function \nin 2015 and made sizeable investments to upgrade our compli-\nance and control frameworks as well as strengthened our risk \nmanagement function.\n\nResolved legacy issues and wound-down our Strategic \nResolution Unit\nOver the last three years, we have resolved major litigation issues \nincluding the US Department of Justice (DOJ) residential mort-\ngage-backed securities (RMBS) matter. \n\nAt year-end 2018 the Strategic Resolution Unit was wound down \nas a separate division. We achieved the targets we set for the \nStrategic Resolution Unit in 2015, releasing significant capi-\ntal for the Group and substantially reducing the negative impact \non income before taxes. The residual portfolio remaining as of \nDecember 31, 2018 is now managed in an Asset Resolution \nUnit (ARU) and will be separately disclosed within the Corporate \nCenter.\n\nStrategy\n\n17\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nReconciliation of adjusted results\nAdjusted results referred to in this document are non-GAAP \nfinancial measures that exclude certain items included in our \nreported results. Management believes that adjusted results pro-\nvide a useful presentation of our operating results for purposes of \nassessing our Group and divisional performance consistently over \ntime, on a basis that excludes items that management does not \nconsider representative of our underlying performance. \n\nThe adjusted operating cost base at constant foreign exchange \nrates from 2015 includes adjustments as made in all our dis-\nclosures for restructuring expenses, major litigation provisions, \n\nexpenses related to business sales and a goodwill impairment \ntaken in the fourth quarter of 2015 as well as adjustments \nfor debit valuation adjustments (DVA) related volatility, foreign \nexchange impacts and for certain accounting changes which \nhad not been in place at the launch of the cost savings program. \nAdjustments for certain accounting changes have been restated \nto reflect grossed up expenses in the Corporate Center and, \nstarting in the first quarter of 2018, also include adjustments \nfor changes from ASU 2014-09 \xe2\x80\x9cRevenue from Contracts with \nCustomers\xe2\x80\x9d.

We \nconfirmed our RoTE target of 10 \xe2\x80\x93 11% for 2019 and 11 \xe2\x80\x93 12% for \n2020 and announced a target of above 12% beyond 2020.\n\nFor 2019 and 2020, we plan to distribute at least 50% of net \nincome to shareholders, primarily through share buybacks and \nthe distribution of a sustainable ordinary dividend, which dividend \namount we expect to increase by at least 5% per annum. For \n2019, the Board of Directors of the Group approved a share buy-\nback program of Group ordinary shares of up to CHF\xc2\xa01.5 billion. \nWe expect to buy back at least CHF\xc2\xa01.0 billion in 2019, subject \nto market and economic conditions. For 2020, we expect a simi-\nlar share buyback program as in 2019, subject to approval by the \nBoard of Directors. The level of the share buyback for 2020 will \nbe set in light of our capital plans and will be subject to prevailing \nmarket conditions, but is expected to be in line with our intention \nto distribute at least 50% of net income. We commenced the \nshare buyback program on January\xc2\xa014, 2019.\n\nOur estimates and targets often include metrics that are non-\nGAAP financial measures and are unaudited. A reconciliation of \nthese estimates and targets to the nearest GAAP measures is \nunavailable without unreasonable efforts. Adjusted results exclude \ngoodwill impairment, major litigation charges, real estate gains \nand other revenue and expense items included in our reported \nresults, which are unavailable on a prospective basis.

The program was approved \nby the Board of Directors of the Group and certain elements \nrequired final approval by FINMA and other global regulators.\n\nProducts and services \nPrivate banking offerings and wealth management \nsolutions\n\nWe offer a wide range of private banking and wealth manage-\nment solutions tailored for our clients in our Swiss Universal Bank, \nInternational Wealth Management and Asia Pacific divisions.\n\nClient segment specific value propositions\nOur wide range of wealth management solutions is tailored to \nspecific client segments.

Switzerland has one of the highest millionaire densities \nworldwide and is expected to continue to have one of the high-\nest average levels of wealth per adult. We remain well-positioned \nin the Swiss market with strong market shares across our client \nsegments.\n\nThe corporate and institutional clients business continues to offer \nattractive opportunities, supported by the expected steady growth \nof the Swiss economy. We are a leading provider of banking ser-\nvices to corporate and institutional clients in Switzerland, utilizing \nour market-leading investment banking capabilities in Switzerland \nfor local execution while leveraging Investment Banking & Capital \nMarkets\xe2\x80\x99 international reach and Global Markets\xe2\x80\x99 placing power.\n\nStructurally, the industry continues to undergo significant change. \nRegulatory requirements for investment advisory services continue \nto increase, including in the areas of suitability and appropriateness \nof advice, client information and documentation. This is expected to \ndrive further consolidation of smaller banks due to the higher critical \nsize necessary to fulfill business and regulatory requirements. We \ncontinue to believe that we are well-positioned to opportunistically \ntake advantage of this potential market consolidation. We have \nmade additional progress in adapting to the changing regulatory \nenvironment and are continuing to dedicate significant resources to \nensure our business is compliant with regulatory standards.\n\nBusiness strategy\n\nSwitzerland, our home market, has always been and is expected \nto remain a key market for our Group and is core to our over-\nall strategy. Within Swiss Universal Bank, we combine all the \nstrengths and critical mass of our Swiss retail, wealth manage-\nment, corporate, institutional and investment banking activities. \nThe division is well-positioned to meet the needs of our clients, \nboth individual and corporate, with a broad suite of customized \nproducts and services. \n\nIn order to further cement our standing as a leading Swiss bank, \nwe continue to focus on the following four key priorities:\n\nBank for Switzerland\nWe are committed to our Swiss home market and to all our clients in \nSwitzerland \xe2\x80\x93 we are a universal bank that serves private, corporate \nand institutional client segments. We intend to expand our market \nshare and continue to be a responsible partner in Swiss society.\n\n22\n\nDivisions\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nThe reduction of management hierarchies and increased scope of \ncontrol at local market levels, introduced in 2017, were fully real-\nized in 2018. Those measures resulted in more efficient priority-\nsetting and faster decision-making in those markets leading to \nincreased client satisfaction. As a consequence of changing client \nneeds, we opened our first digital advisory branch in Switzerland. \nOur digital advisory branch format is designed to work without the \nclassic teller function, but with innovative elements such as a digi-\ntal bar and a lounge area. We continue to see potential in devel-\noping the HNWI and the UHNWI business, which are both wealth \nmarket segments that are growing significantly and remain highly \nattractive. Our holistic offering and the collaboration across the divi-\nsion and across the bank are the bases for our efforts to capture \nfurther growth in both market segments. Our efforts and commit-\nment to Switzerland have been recognized by Euromoney (Best \nBank in Switzerland 2018) and The Banker (Bank of the Year 2018 \nSwitzerland).\n\nBank for Entrepreneurs\nEntrepreneurship has always been important for Credit Suisse, \nand entrepreneurial thinking is one of our core principles. We have \ngrown and will seek to continue to significantly grow our business \nwith entrepreneurs and their companies across all businesses within \nSwiss Universal Bank, including by leveraging our international con-\nnectivity in investment banking and asset management. It is our \nambition to be recognized as the \xe2\x80\x9cBank for Entrepreneurs\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nWe strengthened our focus on being recognized as the \xe2\x80\x9cBank for \nEntrepreneurs\xe2\x80\x9d by launching joint client coverage for private and cor-\nporate clients in 2015. In this context, we increased the number of \nEntrepreneurs & Executives relationship managers and now cover \nthe Swiss market with 15 locations. Our broad range of expertise \nand capabilities enabled us to execute a large number of investment \nbanking transactions in 2018 and we were again recognized as the \nnumber one investment bank in Switzerland.\n\nBank for the Digital World\nWe are transforming the way we serve and advise our clients \nin an increasingly digital society and economy. We expect new \ntechnologies and business models to emerge and must adapt our \nefforts to be successful. To this end, we are investing in digital \ncapabilities with a focus on client engagement, self-service capa-\nbilities and frontline productivity. Digitalization, automation and \ndata management will be key drivers to continuously improve our \ncost position and drive our competitiveness with the possibility to \nfundamentally change the way we work.\n\nDuring 2018, various digital solutions for private, corporate \nand institutional clients as well as relationship managers were \nlaunched. We enhanced our self-service capabilities including \nthrough the introduction of digital client onboarding for corporate \nclients, which allows those clients to identify themselves and open \nan account through a computer or mobile device. This offering \ncomplements the similar online opening capabilities we launched for \nprivate clients in 2017. In 2018 we managed to further improve the \nproductivity of client-facing employees and completed our front-\nto-back digitalization program, which digitalized approximately \n200 processes. The whole program helped us increase our effi-\nciency by reducing manual processes and physical paper forms. \nFurthermore, we have improved client satisfaction through a sig-\nnificant reduction of transaction processing times.\n\nBank for the Next Generation\nWhile we are always mindful of the needs of all clients, we partic-\nularly aim to support the next generation in Switzerland in achiev-\ning their ambitions. Supertrends such as an aging population are \nexpected to fundamentally change our country in coming years \nand will open opportunities for us to make a difference to our \nclients across generations. Developing our own young talents in \ntheir careers with various programs will complement this process \nand is part of our long-term commitment to the next generation in \nSwitzerland.\n\nWe successfully launched Viva Kids in 2017, a new offering dedi-\ncated to our youngest clients. With over 25,000 clients enrolled \nsince its inception, we have exceeded our ambitious expectations. \nViva Kids is designed to help parents in the financial education of \ntheir children and we believe it will be an important contributor for \nour future client base. \n\nAwards and market share momentum \n\nCredit Suisse was highly placed in a number of key industry \nawards in 2018, including: \np  Best Bank in Switzerland \xe2\x80\x93 Euromoney Awards for Excellence \n\n2018\n\np  Best Bank for Wealth Management in Western Europe \xe2\x80\x93 Euro-\n\nmoney Awards for Excellence 2018\n\np  Best Investment Bank in Switzerland \xe2\x80\x93 Euromoney Awards for \n\nExcellence 2018\n\np  Bank of the Year in Switzerland \xe2\x80\x93 The Banker\np  Best Trade Finance Bank in Switzerland \xe2\x80\x93 Global Finance\n\nDivisions\n\n23\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nInternational Wealth \nManagement\n\nBusiness profile \n\nIn International Wealth Management, we cater to the needs of \nour private, corporate and institutional clients by offering expert \nadvice and a broad range of financial solutions. \n\nOur Private Banking business provides comprehensive advi-\nsory services and tailored investment and financing solutions to \nwealthy private clients and external asset managers in Europe, \nthe Middle East, Africa and Latin America. We serve our clients \nthrough 1,110 relationship managers in 43 cities in 25 countries, \nutilizing comprehensive access to the broad spectrum of Credit \nSuisse\xe2\x80\x99s global resources and capabilities as well as a wide range \nof proprietary and third-party products and services.\n\nOur Asset Management business offers investment solutions \nand services globally to a broad range of clients, including pen-\nsion funds, governments, foundations and endowments, corpora-\ntions and individuals, along with our private banking businesses. \nOur asset management capabilities span across a diversified \nrange of asset classes, with a focus on traditional and alternative \nstrategies. \n\nKey data \xe2\x80\x93 International Wealth Management\n\n  \n\xc2\xa0 \n\n       \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nKey data \nNet revenues (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \nIncome before taxes (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \nAssets under management (CHF billion)\xc2\xa0 \n\xe2\x80\x93 Private Banking\xc2\xa0 \n\xe2\x80\x93 Asset Management\xc2\xa0 \nNumber of employees\xc2\xa0 \n\nin / end of \n2016 \n\n2018  \n\n2017   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5,414  \n1,705  \n  \n357.5  \n388.7  \n10,210  \n\n5,111   \n1,351   \n   \n366.9   \n385.6   \n10,250   \n\n4,698 \n1,121 \n \n\n323.2 \n321.6 \n10,300 \n\nBusiness environment\n\nholding around 20% of the world\xe2\x80\x99s wealth. In addition, it is \nexpected that demographic developments relating to an aging \npopulation, such as funding pressure in the public pension sys-\ntems and a transfer of wealth to the next generation, will present \nimportant opportunities in the European private banking markets.\n\nThe asset management industry continues to evolve and grow \nwith positive support from increasing global wealth. At the same \ntime, managers face a number of challenges, including regulatory \ncomplexities and revenue and margin compression. The contin-\nued rise of passive and low-fee products reflects ongoing fee \nsensitivity from investors and although fees for alternative strate-\ngies have been more resilient, market pressure has led to a need \nfor more innovative products. In this environment, managers must \ndemonstrate differentiating capabilities including not only strong \ninvestment performance, but also other value-add capabilities \nsuch as risk management and controls, compliance, client report-\ning, and data security.\n\nFor most of 2018 the wealth and asset management industry \nfaced continued uncertainties, in particular in relation to monetary \npolicy tightening and political uncertainties around the anticipated \nwithdrawal of the UK from the European Union. In addition, inves-\ntors were confronted with a number of unexpected challenges as \nthe US took a more conservative stance on trade relationships \nand the market generally experienced high volatility as well as \nincreasingly challenging conditions towards the end of the year. \nWhile facing structural pressure from industry-specific regulatory \nchanges, the sector saw the continued pursuit of new opportuni-\nties and efficiencies arising from digital technology advancements \nand front-to-back process improvements.\n\nBusiness strategy \n\nOur private banking and asset management businesses are \namong the industry\xe2\x80\x99s leaders by size and reputation in our target \nmarkets and regions. International Wealth Management continues \nto contribute significantly to Credit Suisse\xe2\x80\x99s strategic and finan-\ncial ambitions. The following three strategic priorities guide our \ndecisions:\n\nThe private banking industry continues to benefit from attractive \ngrowth prospects in the European and emerging markets cov-\nered by International Wealth Management, where private bank-\ning assets are expected to grow by approximately 5% annually \nthrough 2022. Regionally, private banking assets are expected \nto grow by approximately 7% in Russia and Central & Eastern \nEurope, by approximately 8% in the Middle East & Africa and by \napproximately 6% in Latin America. This growth is expected to \nbe fueled by an increase in population, entrepreneurial wealth \ncreation and technological advancements. Although wealth is \nexpected to grow at a slower pace in Europe (by approximately \n3% annually), this region continues to be of crucial importance, \n\nDeliver client value\nWe focus on deploying solutions and products that are tailored to \nour clients\xe2\x80\x99 needs, holistically advising them on their assets and \nliabilities. We are leveraging our investment strategy and research \ncapabilities, including the Credit Suisse House View, as part of \nour approach to further optimize the risk/return profiles of our \nclients\xe2\x80\x99 investment portfolios. Our Asset Management business \ncontinues to strengthen its partnership with our wealth manage-\nment businesses to provide customized products and solutions to \nour clients. We are addressing our clients\xe2\x80\x99 sophisticated financing \nneeds by broadening our lending services and leveraging addi-\ntional resources.\n\n24\n\nDivisions\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nEnhance client proximity\nOur focus on enhancing client proximity is intended to capture \nmarket share, which we are facilitating by hiring predominantly \nexperienced relationship managers. In addition, we are strength-\nening and adapting our footprint with technology investments in \nour key hubs, while selectively investing in onshore locations in \nmarkets with attractive growth prospects. To facilitate collabora-\ntion and improve the breadth and depth of solutions offered to our \ntargeted strategic UHNWI and entrepreneur clients, we operate \na strategic clients business, consisting of senior coverage offi-\ncers, who are fully embedded in our client coverage organization \nand highly connected across the Group.

According to Credit \nSuisse Research Institute\xe2\x80\x99s Global Wealth Report 2018, in the 12 \nmonths to mid-2018, Asia Pacific represented the largest wealth \nregion, with China having the second largest household wealth \nbehind the US. An increase in wealth held by UHNWIs and \nHNWIs is expected to result in larger capital pools for investment \nand enhanced opportunities for entrepreneur-led activity, notwith-\nstanding short-term market cyclicality and pressures.\n\nDivisions\n\n25\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nDespite positive long term dynamics, the banking environment \nin Asia Pacific grew increasingly challenging during the course \nof 2018 as trade tensions and geopolitical developments led to \nhigher market volatility, generally cautious investor sentiment and \nlower risk appetite. As a result, asset prices and client transaction \nactivities contracted, particularly in the second half of the year.\n\nBusiness strategy \n\nOur business strategy remains steadfast despite short term mar-\nket cyclicality and pressures and is centered on the growth of \nwealth and financial markets in Asia, as well as on our ambition \nto be \xe2\x80\x9cThe Bank for Entrepreneurs in Asia Pacific\xe2\x80\x9d. Our divisional \nmodel and integrated delivery are key differentiators that support \nour client-centric strategy. Our consistent focus on maintaining a \ndiversified footprint and leading market positions has been critical \nto meet our clients\xe2\x80\x99 needs, attract strong talent and foster a part-\nnership culture that can deliver attractive returns and growth with \ndisciplined risk management.\n\nDespite challenging market conditions during 2018, our business \ndemonstrated resilient performance, supported by strong net new \nasset generation, higher recurring revenues and a culture of col-\nlaboration. Our diversified platform across a mix of clients, countries \nand products is essential to effectively and sustainably compete in a \nregion as dynamic as Asia Pacific, with its variety of economic, busi-\nness and client characteristics.\n\nLooking ahead, our strategic focus continues to be on deepening \nkey client relationships, further growing our recurring revenues, \nmaintaining our market leading franchises across Asia Pacific and \ncontinuing to enhance our productivity and risk controls.\n\nSignificant transactions \n\np  In South East Asia, we advised Equis Pte.

Market conditions were more favorable in 2018 for equity \ntrading, particularly in equity derivatives, as a return of volatil-\nity and higher volumes resulted in increased client activity. Credit \nmarket conditions were challenging compared to the prior year, \ncharacterized by rising interest rates, significant widening of credit \nspreads and higher volatility, which led to lower client activity, par-\nticularly in our securitized products and credit trading and under-\nwriting businesses. In addition, our leveraged finance and invest-\nment grade underwriting businesses declined in 2018, reflecting \nlower issuance activity. \n\nBusiness strategy\n\nIn 2018, we successfully completed our three-year Credit Suisse \nGroup restructuring, creating a more cost efficient and capital \nlight business with a reduced risk profile. We made consistent \nprogress towards our goals of reducing earnings volatility and \nproviding a differentiated platform to our wealth management and \ninstitutional clients. While the revenue environment was challeng-\ning during the year, we reduced operating expenses significantly \ncompared to 2017 as a result of our continued cost discipline by \neliminating duplication across functions and optimizing our New \nYork and London footprint. As a result, we achieved our end-\n2018 ambition of less than USD 4.8 billion in operating expenses, \non an adjusted basis. As of the end of 2018, we also operated \nunder our thresholds of USD 60 billion in risk-weighted assets \nand USD 290 billion in leverage exposure.\n\nDuring the year we rationalized part of our macro and emerg-\ning markets businesses, which allowed us to continue to invest in \nour International Trading Solutions (ITS) and equities platforms, \nas we pivot towards supporting our wealth management clients. \nIn ITS, we began to see the benefits from our investments in the \nplatform as evidenced by an increase in ITS revenues compared \nto 2017, reflecting improved collaboration. In addition, we main-\ntained strong positions in our credit businesses, which generate \nhigh returns and drive profits for the Global Markets division.\n\nLooking ahead, the division continues to focus on further increas-\ning cross-divisional collaboration to drive revenue growth with \nour core institutional, corporate and wealth management clients, \nincreasing operating leverage with ongoing cost controls and \nattracting top talent. In addition, we are investing in key talent \nacross the franchise and will remain focused on defending our \nleading market positions across equities and fixed income prod-\nucts. With regard to costs, we will continue to focus on productiv-\nity cost savings, including increasing efficiencies from consoli-\ndating redundant platforms and eliminating duplication across \nfunctions. We believe that the combination of increased revenues \nand greater cost controls have the potential to help us support the \noverall Group return on tangible equity attributable to sharehold-\ners target of 10%-11% by year-end 2019.\n\nDivisions\n\n27\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nInvestment Banking &  \nCapital Markets\n\nBusiness profile \n\nThe Investment Banking & Capital Markets division offers a broad \nrange of investment banking products and services which include \nadvisory services related to M&A, divestitures, takeover defense \nstrategies, business restructurings and spin-offs, as well as debt \nand equity underwriting of public offerings and private place-\nments.

Persistent geopolitical tensions surrounding global trade and \nnegotiations related to the withdrawal of the UK from the EU had a \nconsiderable impact on financial markets. Capital markets slowed \ndown with volatility fueled by an equity markets correction. The \nunderwriting activity across both equity and debt products declined \nwith the industry-wide fee pool down 11% compared to 2017. In \ncontrast, global M&A activity was strong in 2018 with announced \nvolumes up 19% compared to 2017, driven by mega deals across \nmany sectors. \n\nBusiness strategy \n\nOur strategy focuses on leveraging our global structuring and \nexecution expertise to develop innovative financing and advisory \nsolutions for our clients. Our divisional strategy is designed to \ngenerate sustainable, profitable growth and continue delivering \nreturns in excess of our cost of capital. Our key strategic priori-\nties include: achieving a balanced product mix, optimizing the \nclient coverage model and using our global platform to meet our \nclients\xe2\x80\x99 needs for cross-border expertise in developed and emerg-\ning markets. \n\n28\n\nDivisions\n\nA key element of our strategy is rebalancing our product mix to \ngenerate stronger results in M&A advisory and equity underwrit-\ning, while maintaining our leading leveraged finance franchise. We \nexpect that refocusing our efforts on these products will not only \nallow us to better support our clients\xe2\x80\x99 strategic goals, but will also \ncontribute to a revenue mix that is more diversified and less vola-\ntile through the market cycle.\n\nWe continue to optimize our client strategy in order to deliver effi-\ncient and effective client coverage. Our strategic objective is to \nalign, and selectively invest in, our coverage and capital resources \nwith the largest growth opportunities and where our franchise is \nwell-positioned.

For further information, \nrefer to the Development of the Strategic Resolution Unit section \nbelow.\n\nThe Strategic Resolution Unit was established to facilitate the \neffective and rapid wind-down of capital usage and reduce the \ndrag on the Group pre-tax income results through the reduction \nof costs. The Strategic Resolution Unit included remaining port-\nfolios from former non-strategic units and transfers of additional \nexposures from the business divisions. \n\nKey data \xe2\x80\x93 Strategic Resolution Unit\n\n  \n\xc2\xa0 \n\n       \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nKey data \nNet revenues (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \nIncome/(loss) before taxes (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \nNumber of employees\xc2\xa0 \n\nin / end of \n2016 \n\n2018  \n\n2017   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(708)  \n(1,381)  \n1,320  \n\n(886)   \n(2,135)   \n1,530   \n\n(1,271) \n(5,759) \n1,830 \n\nComposition\nOur Strategic Resolution Unit contained specific wind-down activi-\nties and positions. For reporting purposes, the Strategic Resolu-\ntion Unit was split into the following categories: restructuring of \nselect onshore businesses which contained the onshore reposi-\ntioning in select Western European countries and the US; legacy \ncross-border and small markets businesses which included the \nrepositioning of cross-border businesses; legacy asset manage-\nment positions which included portfolio divestitures and discontin-\nued operations; legacy investment banking portfolios; and legacy \nfunding costs relating to non-Basel III compliant debt instruments.\n\nNon-controlling interests without significant economic inter-\nest were reflected in the Strategic Resolution Unit and included \nrevenues and expenses from the consolidation of certain private \nequity funds and other entities in which we had non-controlling \ninterests without significant economic interest.\n\nDevelopment of the Strategic Resolution Unit\nAs part of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s strategy announced in the fourth quar-\nter of 2015, we formed the Strategic Resolution Unit to oversee \nthe effective wind-down of businesses and positions that did not \nfit our strategic direction in the most efficient manner possible. At \nthat time the Strategic Resolution Unit was created to facilitate \nthe immediate right-sizing of our business divisions from a capi-\ntal perspective and included remaining portfolios from our former \nnon-strategic units plus additional transfers from the business divi-\nsions. The expectation at that time was that the Strategic Resolu-\ntion Unit\xe2\x80\x99s risk-weighted assets and leverage exposure would be \nreduced by approximately 80% by 2020, excluding operational risk. \nIn March 2016 we updated our expectation of the timing of the \n\n80% reduction of the division\xe2\x80\x99s risk-weighted assets and leverage \nexposure to year-end 2019, excluding operational risk. In the first \nquarter of 2017, we announced an acceleration of the release of \ncapital from the Strategic Resolution Unit and a plan to complete \nthe wind-down of the division by the end of 2018.\n\nAt our Investor Day in 2017 we announced that we estimated \nadjusted operating expenses in the Strategic Resolution Unit \nwould amount to approximately USD\xc2\xa0500 million and USD\xc2\xa0250 \nmillion in 2018 and 2019, respectively. We further announced our \nadjusted pre-tax loss targets of approximately USD\xc2\xa01,400 million \nand USD\xc2\xa0500 million in 2018 and 2019, respectively. The alloca-\ntion of costs to the Strategic Resolution Unit was conducted pur-\nsuant to a Group-wide allocation methodology, i.e., the Strategic \nResolution Unit was subject to the same cost allocation meth-\nodology as the strategic divisions; however reductions in service \nusage during the course of the wind-down of the division reduced \nallocated costs. We targeted a reduction of the Strategic Reso-\nlution Unit\xe2\x80\x99s risk-weighted assets (excluding operational risk) to \nUSD\xc2\xa011 billion and leverage exposure to USD\xc2\xa040 billion by year-\nend 2018.\n\nAs of the end of 2018, risk-weighted assets (excluding opera-\ntional risk) in the Strategic Resolution Unit had been reduced \nto USD\xc2\xa07 billion and leverage exposure had been reduced to \nUSD\xc2\xa030 billion. Reported pre-tax loss had been reduced to \nCHF\xc2\xa01,381 million and adjusted pre-tax loss had been reduced to \nCHF\xc2\xa01,240 million as of the end of 2018.\n > Adjusted results are non-GAAP financial measures.

The residual portfo-\nlio remaining as of December 31, 2018 is now managed in an \nAsset Resolution Unit and will be separately disclosed within the \nCorporate Center. Certain activities such as legacy funding costs \nand noncontrolling interests without significant economic interest, \nwhich were previously part of the Strategic Resolution Unit, have \nbeen moved into the Corporate Center and will not be reflected in \nthe Asset Resolution Unit. At our Investor Day in 2018 we con-\nfirmed our estimate that the Asset Resolution Unit would have an \nadjusted pre-tax loss of approximately USD\xc2\xa0500 million in 2019.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cFinancial goals\xe2\x80\x9d in Strategy \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse strategy for further infor-\nmation on the reconciliation of our estimates and targets to the nearest GAAP \nmeasures.\n\nOn occasion, the reduction of exposures in the Strategic Reso-\nlution Unit involved the maturation of lending facilities or other \ntransactions that wholly or partially may have been renewed or \nextended by our strategic business divisions, such as Global Mar-\nkets or International Wealth Management. Similarly, there may \nhave been occasions where strategic business divisions would \nenter into new transactions with counterparties resulting in expo-\nsures that may have had similar characteristics to those recorded \nin the Strategic Resolution Unit. This was aligned with the \nGroup\xe2\x80\x99s risk appetite and that of the relevant strategic divisions.\n\nDivisions\n\n29\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nIn 2017, we amended and enhanced our risk appetite frame-\nwork in an effort to provide additional governance and controls \nto ensure all new business activities are scrutinized to distinguish \nbetween those types of business exposures held in the Strategic \nResolution Unit that will be allowed for execution in our strategic \ndivisions and those that will be prohibited or for which we have \nlimited risk appetite.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2018, after a business reassessment, the \nExecutive Board and the Audit Committee approved the trans-\nfer of twelve counterparty relationships and associated financ-\ning transactions from the Strategic Resolution Unit to the Global \nMarkets and Investment Banking & Capital Markets divisions. The \nexecution of these transfers occurred in the first quarter of 2018. \nThe impact of these transfers on risk-weighted assets and lever-\nage exposure for the Strategic Resolution Unit was a decline of \napproximately USD\xc2\xa00.8 billion and USD\xc2\xa01.3 billion, respectively. \nRisk-weighted assets of USD\xc2\xa00.7 billion and leverage exposure \nof USD\xc2\xa01.2 billion were transferred to Global Markets and risk-\nweighted assets of USD\xc2\xa00.1 billion and leverage exposure of \nUSD\xc2\xa00.1 billion were transferred to Investment Banking & Capital \nMarkets.\n\nA reassessment in the first quarter of 2018 of certain assets \nunder management and assets under custody recorded in the \nStrategic Resolution Unit resulted in a change in the estimate of \nthe expected outflows in connection with the tax regularization \nof client assets. The estimate of the expected outflows declined \nby approximately CHF\xc2\xa01.9 billion for assets under management, \nand CHF\xc2\xa01.1 billion, CHF\xc2\xa00.6 billion and CHF\xc2\xa00.2 billion of such \nassets under management were transferred to Asia Pacific, Inter-\nnational Wealth Management and Swiss Universal Bank, respec-\ntively. In addition, CHF\xc2\xa00.6 billion of assets under custody were \ntransferred to International Wealth Management. The transfers \nwere in line with the original transfer of such assets to the Stra-\ntegic Resolution Unit and as such were reflected as a structural \neffect in our asset under management disclosures, with no impact \nto net new assets.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2018, after a business reassessment \nin connection with our planning relating to the withdrawal of the \nUK from the EU, the Audit Committee approved the transfer \nof assets and liabilities relating to Credit Suisse (Deutschland) \nAktiengesellschaft from the Strategic Resolution Unit to the \nInvestment Banking & Capital Markets division. The execution of \nthis transfer occurred in the second quarter of 2018. The impact \nof the transfer on risk-weighted assets for the Strategic Resolu-\ntion Unit was a decline of approximately USD\xc2\xa00.2 billion.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2018, a reassessment of certain assets \nunder management and assets under custody recorded in the \nStrategic Resolution Unit resulted in a change in the estimate of \nthe expected outflows in connection with the tax regularization \nof client assets. The estimate of the expected outflows declined \nby approximately CHF\xc2\xa01.9 billion for assets under management, \nand CHF\xc2\xa01.5 billion and CHF\xc2\xa00.4 billion of such assets under \nmanagement were transferred to International Wealth Manage-\nment and Swiss Universal Bank, respectively. The transfers were \nin line with the original transfer of such assets to the Strategic \nResolution Unit and as such were reflected as a structural effect \nin our asset under management disclosures, with no impact to net \nnew assets. Additionally, the impact of these transfers on lever-\nage exposure for the Strategic Resolution Unit was a decline of \napproximately USD\xc2\xa00.1 billion, transferred to International Wealth \nManagement. In addition, after a business reassessment, the \nAudit Committee approved a transfer of 11 third-party fund inter-\nests from the Strategic Resolution Unit to International Wealth \nManagement.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cUpdate to the risk appetite framework\xe2\x80\x9d in III \xe2\x80\x93 Treasury, Risk, Bal-\n\nance sheet and Off-balance sheet \xe2\x80\x93 Risk management \xe2\x80\x93 Risk appetite frame-\nwork for further information.\n\n30\n\nDivisions\n\n\x0c \n\nRegulation and supervision\n\n \n\nOverview \n\nOur operations are regulated by authorities in each of the jurisdic-\ntions in which we have offices, branches and subsidiaries.\n\nCentral banks and other bank regulators, financial services agen-\ncies, securities agencies and exchanges and self-regulatory orga-\nnizations are among the regulatory authorities that oversee our \nbusinesses. There is coordination among many of our regulators, \nin particular among our primary regulators in Switzerland, the US, \nthe EU and the UK as well as in the Asia Pacific region.\n\nThe supervisory and regulatory regimes of the countries in which \nwe operate determine to some degree our ability to expand into \nnew markets, the services and products that we are able to offer in \nthose markets and how we structure specific operations.\n\nGovernments and regulatory authorities around the world have \nresponded to the challenging market conditions beginning in 2007 \nby proposing and enacting numerous reforms of the regulatory \nframework for financial services firms such as the Group. In particu-\nlar, a number of reforms have been proposed and enacted by regula-\ntors, including our primary regulators, which could potentially have \na material effect on our business. These regulatory developments \ncould result in additional costs or limit or restrict the way we conduct \nour business. Although we expect regulatory-related costs and capi-\ntal requirements for all major financial services firms (including the \nGroup) to continue to be high, we cannot predict the likely impact \nof proposed regulations on our businesses or results. We believe, \nhowever, that overall we are well positioned for regulatory reform, \nas we have reduced risk and maintained strong capital, funding and \nliquidity.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cRisk factors\xe2\x80\x9d for further information on risks that may arise relating to \n\nregulation.\n\ngroup and the home country\xe2\x80\x99s approach to internal total loss-\nabsorbing capacity calibration.

(ISDA) published an ISDA 2018 US Resolution Stay \nProtocol (the ISDA US Protocol) to facilitate compliance with the \nfinal rules (the QFC Stay Rules) promulgated by the US banking \nregulators in 2017 requiring, among other things, the US opera-\ntions of non-US G-SIBs to include provisions in qualified financial \ncontracts (QFCs) that limit the ability of counterparties to exercise \n\xe2\x80\x9cdefault rights\xe2\x80\x9d arising in the context of a resolution of the G-SIB \nand ensure that actions taken under US resolution regimes are \nenforceable on a cross-border basis.

Under the statement of \npolicy, internal MREL requirements for UK material subsidiaries \nof non-UK global systemically important banks (G-SIBs), such as \nCredit Suisse, will be scaled between 75% and 90% of external \nMREL based on factors including the resolution strategy of the \n\nSupervision \nOn June 15, 2018, the Swiss Parliament adopted the Federal \nFinancial Services Act (FFSA) and the Financial Institutions Act \n(FinIA). The FFSA regulates the provision of financial services in \nSwitzerland, including to Swiss clients from abroad on a cross-bor-\nder basis, as well as the offering of financial instruments in or into, \nand the admission to trading of financial instruments in, Switzer-\nland. The FinIA governs the license requirements and provides for a \ndifferentiated supervisory regime for portfolio managers, trustees, \n\nRegulation and supervision\n\n31\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nmanagers of collective assets, fund management companies and \ninvestment firms (so-called financial institutions) as well as for \nSwiss branches and representative offices of foreign financial insti-\ntutions. The FinIA introduces prudential supervision of certain cat-\negories of asset managers that have previously not been subject to \nsupervision by special supervisory bodies. The FFSA and FinIA are \nexpected to enter into effect on January 1, 2020. The implement-\ning ordinances were published on October 24, 2018 for consulta-\ntion until February 6, 2019.\n\nOn July 18, 2018, FINMA published its revised Anti-Money Laun-\ndering Ordinance (AMLO-FINMA). For Swiss financial intermedi-\naries with branches or group companies outside of Switzerland, \nthe revised AMLO-FINMA sets out in detail the requirements \nfor global monitoring of money laundering and terrorist financ-\ning risks, in particular legal and reputational risks. The revised \nAMLO-FINMA also specifies the risk management measures to \nbe put in place if domiciliary companies or complex structures \nare used or if there are links with high-risk countries. The revised \nAMLO-FINMA will enter into effect on January 1, 2020.\n\nIn September 2018, FINMA announced the conclusion of two \nenforcement procedures against Credit Suisse AG. The first pro-\ncedure related to past interactions with the F\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9ration Internatio-\nnale de Football Association (FIFA), the Brazilian oil corporation \nPetr\xc3\xb3leo Brasileiro S.A. (Petrobras) and the Venezuelan oil corpo-\nration Petr\xc3\xb3leos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA). The second proce-\ndure related to a significant business relationship with a politically \nexposed person. FINMA identified deficiencies in anti-money \nlaundering processes for both of these procedures as well as \nshortcomings in Credit Suisse AG\xe2\x80\x99s control mechanisms and risk \nmanagement for the second procedure. The Bank has cooperated \nwith FINMA throughout this process and FINMA acknowledged the \nnumerous proactive measures the Bank has adopted since the end \nof 2015 to strengthen its compliance procedures in general as well \nas specific efforts to combat money laundering. FINMA recom-\nmended additional measures to complement these actions and to \naccelerate the implementation of the steps already initiated by the \nBank and will commission an independent third party to review the \nimplementation and effectiveness of these measures.\n\nTax \nOn September 28, 2018, the Tax Proposal 17 or the Federal Act \non Tax Reform and AHV Financing (TRAF) was adopted by the \nSwiss Parliament. The TRAF replaces the Corporate Tax Reform \nAct III (CTR III), which was rejected in a public vote on February \n12, 2017. Like the CTR III, the TRAF provides for an abolish-\nment of the cantonal tax privileges for holding companies, mixed \ncompanies and domicile companies. The TRAF includes, among \nother measures, a patent box that is mandatory for all cantons but \nnarrower than the one contained in CTR III, an optional surplus \nresearch and development allowance of 50%, a notional interest \ndeduction and a step-up in basis. Subject to certain exemptions, \nthe TRAF introduces a 50:50% distribution rule according to \nwhich withholding tax-free (and for Swiss resident private indi-\nviduals, income tax-free) distributions out of capital contribution \n\n32\n\nRegulation and supervision\n\nreserves made by companies listed in Switzerland shall only ben-\nefit from the tax-free treatment if and to the extent the company \ndistributes a taxable dividend in the same amount (provided that \nthe company has distributable profits and retained earnings). In \nJanuary 2019, the optional referendum on TRAF was called, and \nthe popular vote is scheduled for May 19, 2019. Unless the TRAF \nis rejected in the referendum, its main provisions will enter into \nforce on January 1, 2020, with some provisions having entered \ninto force already on January 1, 2019, including the provisions \non step-up. In connection with the tax reform, several cantons \nhad announced to cut their statutory corporate income tax rates \nto approximately 12%, subject to, and simultaneously with, the \neffectiveness of the reform.\n\nOn December 14, 2018, the Swiss Parliament adopted the bill \non the Federal Act on Calculation of the Participation Deduction \nfor \xe2\x80\x9cToo Big to Fail\xe2\x80\x9d Instruments. The bill is subject to an optional \nreferendum, which may be called until April 7, 2019. In March \n2019, the Federal Council determined that, if no referendum is \ncalled, the act will enter into force retroactively as of January 1, \n2019. Current legislation requires systemically relevant banks to \nissue contingent convertible bonds, write-off bonds and bail-in \nbonds through their top holding company from January 1, 2020 \nat the latest. Despite the top holding company on-lending the \nfunds internally to direct or indirect subsidiaries, current corporate \nincome tax laws require the top holding company to allocate inter-\nest paid under the contingent convertible bonds, write-off bonds \nor bail-in bonds to the participation exemption for dividends of the \ntop holding company. This reduces the participation exemption \nfor dividends of the top holding company of systemically relevant \nbanks and may lead to materially higher corporate income taxes \nfor such top holding company. This inadvertent consequence of \nhigher corporate income taxes is inconsistent with the \xe2\x80\x9cToo Big \nto Fail\xe2\x80\x9d legislation\xe2\x80\x99s objective of strengthening the equity capital \nof systemically relevant banks. If enacted, the proposed legisla-\ntion will permit systemically relevant banks to carve out interest \npaid in respect of such instruments for purposes of calculating tax \nexempt net participation income and thereby remedy the effect of \nhigher corporate income taxes from higher interest allocations.\n\nUS\n\nIn July 2010, the US enacted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform \nand Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), which provides \na broad framework for regulatory changes. Although rulemaking \nin respect of many of the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act has \nalready taken place, implementation will require further rulemak-\ning by different regulators, including the US Department of the \nTreasury (US Treasury), the Board of Governors of the Federal \nReserve System (Fed), the US Securities and Exchange Com-\nmission (SEC), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency \n(OCC), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Finan-\ncial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), and uncertainty remains \nabout the details of implementation.\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nSanctions\nAs a result of allegations concerning Russian acts related to \nUkraine, Syria, cybersecurity and electoral interference, in 2018 \nthe US Treasury\xe2\x80\x99s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) \ndesignated a number of Russian government officials, business \npeople and certain related companies as specially designated \nnationals (SDNs), which blocks their assets and prohibits deal-\nings within US jurisdiction by both the newly designated SDNs \nand entities owned 50% or more by one or more blocked per-\nsons. US law also authorizes the imposition of other restrictions \nagainst non-US entities which, among other activities, engage in \nsignificant transactions with or provide material support to such \nsanctioned persons. OFAC issued new general licenses concur-\nrently with the designations to provide a limited time period to \nwind down pre-existing contracts and divest or withdraw from \nbusiness relationships with many of the recently sanctioned per-\nsons and entities, but these licenses are temporary. Further sanc-\ntions related to Russia or additional Russian persons or entities \nare possible, and the potential effects of related disruptions may \ninclude an adverse impact on our businesses.\n\nSince 2017, OFAC has imposed, and in early 2019 continued to \nexpand, sanctions related to Venezuela that, among other restric-\ntions, block the assets of Venezuela\xe2\x80\x99s state-owned oil company \nand certain government officials, prohibit further dealings with \nthem within US jurisdiction and restrict the ability of US persons \nto purchase new debt of and certain bonds issued by the govern-\nment of Venezuela, subject to certain exceptions and licenses. \nFurther sanctions related to Venezuela or Venezuelan entities \nare possible, and the potential effects of related disruptions may \ninclude an adverse impact on our businesses.\n\nSupervision \nOn May 24, 2018, the US President signed into law the Eco-\nnomic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection \nAct (EGRRCPA). EGRRCPA raises the thresholds at which US \nenhanced prudential standards promulgated pursuant to the \nDodd-Frank Act would apply to large bank holding companies \n(BHCs) and foreign banking organizations (FBOs) with between \nUSD 50 billion and USD 250 billion in global consolidated assets. \nBecause our global consolidated assets are above USD 250 bil-\nlion, we do not expect to automatically benefit from the increase \nin thresholds. EGRRCPA also loosens the restrictions imposed by \nthe so-called \xe2\x80\x9cVolcker Rule\xe2\x80\x9d on a banking entity sharing a name \nwith a covered fund that it advises, although the name sharing \nrestriction would continue to prevent us from sharing the Credit \nSuisse name with a covered fund. The Volcker Rule limits the \nability of banking entities to sponsor or invest in certain private \nequity or hedge funds, broadly defined, and to engage in certain \ntypes of proprietary trading for their own account.\n\nOn June 14, 2018, the Fed issued a final rule establishing single \ncounterparty credit limits (SCCLs) for BHCs with total consoli-\ndated assets of USD 250 billion or more, US global systemically \nimportant bank holding companies, the US operations of FBOs \nwith global consolidated assets of USD 250 billion or more, and \nintermediate holding companies (IHCs) with total consolidated \n\nassets that equal or exceed USD 50 billion that are subsidiaries \nof such FBOs. The final rule limits aggregate net credit exposures \nto any single unaffiliated counterparty based on capital ratios. The \nfinal rule includes a regime of substituted compliance with home \ncountry rules for the combined US operations of FBOs (including \nour US IHC and New York Branch) that can certify that the FBO \nmeets, on a consolidated basis, large exposure standards estab-\nlished by their home-country supervisor that are consistent with \nthe large exposures framework established by the Basel Com-\nmittee on Banking Supervision (BCBS). IHCs, however, including \nour US IHC, are ineligible for the substituted compliance regime \nand remain subject to a separate SCCL requirement. Our US IHC \nwill be required to comply by July 1, 2020. If our combined US \noperations are unable to certify that they can meet the criteria to \nqualify for the regime of substituted compliance, our combined \nUS operations will be required to comply by January 1, 2020.\n\nResolution regime\nOn December 20, 2018, the FDIC and the Fed provided feed-\nback on the July 2018 resolution plans submitted by the four \nFBOs with large and complex US operations, including us. Our \nfeedback letter did not find any deficiencies in our July 2018 plan \nand noted meaningful improvements over our July 2015 plan, \nincluding reorganizations of our US operations, pre-positioning \nof total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) and liquidity in the US, \nshared services resiliency and greater operational capabilities. \nThe FDIC and the Fed noted shortcomings in the July 2018 \nplans of the FBOs, with ours relating to governance mechanisms, \nliquidity modelling and critical services mapping. A project plan to \nremediate these shortcomings is due by April 5, 2019. Our next \nresolution plan is due in July of 2020.\n\nInvestment services regulation\nOn June 21, 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the \nFifth Circuit issued its mandate vacating the US Department of \nLabor\xe2\x80\x99s final rules revising the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cfiduciary\xe2\x80\x9d for pur-\nposes of the US Employee Retirement Income Security Act of \n1974, as amended, and US Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as \namended, in their entirety. As a result, no revision of our policies, \nprocedures or practices related to the US Department of Labor\xe2\x80\x99s \nvacated rule is necessary.\n\nTax\nOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was enacted \nin the US, which revises US corporate income tax law by, among \nother things, introducing the base erosion and anti-abuse tax \n(BEAT), effective as of January 1, 2018. It is broadly levied on \ntax deductions created by certain payments, for example, for \ninterest and services, to affiliated group companies outside the \nUS, in the case where the calculated tax based on a modified \ntaxable income exceeds the amount of ordinary federal corporate \nincome taxes paid. The tax rates applicable for banks are 6% for \n2018, 11% for 2019 until 2025 and 13.5% from 2026 onward. \nOn the basis of the current analysis of the BEAT tax regime, \nfollowing the draft regulations issued by the US Treasury on \nDecember 13, 2018, we regard it as more likely than not that the \nGroup will be subject to this regime in 2018. The finalization of \n\nRegulation and supervision\n\n33\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nUS BEAT regulations is expected to occur in 2019. Prospectively, \nadditional tax regulations of the US tax reform relating to interest \ndeductibility may also impact Credit Suisse.\n\nEU \n\nThe EU, the UK and other national European jurisdictions have \nalso proposed and enacted a wide range of prudential, securities \nand governance regulations to address systemic risk and to fur-\nther regulate financial institutions, products and markets. These \nproposals are at various stages of the EU pre-legislative, legisla-\ntive rule-making and implementation processes, and their final \nform and cumulative impact remain uncertain.\n\nInvestment services regulation\nOn December 21, 2017, the European Commission decided to \nrecognize the equivalence of the Swiss legal and supervisory \nframework for trading venues with that of the EU for a temporary \nperiod of one year. On December 17, 2018, the European Com-\nmission extended the equivalence for six months. The decision \nallows European securities traders to meet the new Markets in \nFinancial Instruments Regulation (MiFIR) shares trading obligation \non Swiss exchanges until June 30, 2019.\n\nAnti-money laundering regulation\nOn June 19, 2018, the text of the Fifth Money Laundering Direc-\ntive (MLD5) was published in the Official Journal of the EU. \nMLD5 entered into force on July 9, 2018 and the laws of the \nEU member states must comply with the requirements of MLD5 \nby January 10, 2020. Among other things, MLD5 clarified the \nrequirements for enhanced due diligence measures and coun-\ntermeasures relating to high-risk third countries and introduced \na new obligation for EU member states to establish centralized \nmechanisms to identify holders and controllers of bank and pay-\nment accounts.\n\nPrudential regulation\nIn November 2016, the European Commission published its leg-\nislative proposals for the amendment of the Capital Requirements \nRegulation (CRR) (through an amending Regulation CRR II), the \nCapital Requirements Directive IV (CRD IV) (through an amend-\ning Directive CRD V) and the EU Bank Recovery and Resolu-\ntion Directive (BRRD) (through an amending Directive BRRD II). \nAfter trialogue negotiations between the EU Commission, Parlia-\nment and Council, political agreement on this legislative package \nwas reached in December 2018, and this legislative package is \nexpected to enter into force during the first quarter of 2019. Our \nEU banks and investment firms will be subject to CRR II, which \ncontains, among other things, proposed reforms to the CRR \nregarding international prudential standards based on the Basel III \nstandards and provisions relating to, among other things, leverage \nratio, market risk, counterparty credit risk and large exposures \nand implementing the Financial Stability Board\xe2\x80\x99s (FSB) TLAC \nstandard. The majority of the CRR II measures will apply begin-\nning in 2021. In addition, Credit Suisse will be expected to com-\nply with the CRD V proposal, which includes a requirement for \nnon-EU groups that are G-SIBs, which have two or more bank or \n\n34\n\nRegulation and supervision\n\ninvestment firm subsidiaries in the EU, to establish an interme-\ndiate parent undertaking in the EU, or two intermediate parent \nundertakings under certain specific circumstances, by 2023. \nSimilarly, Credit Suisse will be subject to BRRD II, which revises \nthe existing EU regime relating to MREL to align it with the TLAC \nstandard and to introduce, among other things, changes to the \ncontractual recognition of bail-in and a new moratorium power for \ncompetent authorities.\n\nTax\nOn May 25, 2018, the Council of the European Union adopted \nan amendment to the Directive on Administrative Cooperation \nin (direct) taxation in the EU, with respect to mandatory auto-\nmatic exchange of information in the field of taxation in relation to \nreportable cross-border arrangements, imposing reporting require-\nments on intermediaries in relation to certain arrangements. The \nprovisions of the amendment (DAC6) must be implemented into \neach EU member state\xe2\x80\x99s domestic law by the end of 2019, and \nwill apply from July 1, 2020. However, once DAC6 applies, the \nreporting requirements (where triggered) will capture arrange-\nments where the first step was implemented after June 25, 2018.\n\nUK\n\nUK-EU relationship\nOn June 23, 2016, voters in the UK voted to leave the EU in \na non-binding referendum. On March 16, 2017, the European \nUnion (Notification of Withdrawal) Bill was enacted and on March \n29, 2017, the UK government submitted the formal notification \nunder Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty to the European Council of \nthe intention of the UK to withdraw from the EU. In June 2018, \nthe European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (EUWA) was enacted \nin connection with the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from \nthe EU. The EUWA, among other things, preserves EU-derived \nUK legislation and incorporates directly applicable EU legisla-\ntion in UK law, as \xe2\x80\x9cretained EU law\xe2\x80\x9d, on March 29, 2019, and \ndelegates legislative powers to the UK government to prevent, \nremedy or mitigate any failure of retained EU law to operate \neffectively, or any other deficiency in retained EU law arising as a \nresult of the UK\xe2\x80\x99s withdrawal from the EU. A withdrawal agree-\nment was negotiated between the EU and UK and finalized on \nNovember 14, 2018, which included an agreement on a standstill \ntransition period until December 31, 2020 to further negoti-\nate the future relationship. During the transition period, the UK \nwould continue to implement new EU law that comes into effect \nand the UK would continue to be treated as part of the EU\xe2\x80\x99s \nsingle market in financial services. The UK Parliament has not yet \napproved the withdrawal agreement between the EU and the UK, \nand it appears likely that there will be a delay of the UK\xe2\x80\x99s with-\ndrawal from the EU for a period of time beyond March 29, 2019, \nalthough it is still possible that the UK could leave the EU without \nsuch an agreement in place. To prepare for withdrawal, HM Trea-\nsury is using its powers under the EUWA to remedy deficiencies \nin retained EU law relating to financial services, through statu-\ntory instruments. The statutory instruments are not intended to \nmake policy changes, other than to reflect the UK\xe2\x80\x99s new position \noutside the EU, and to smooth the transition to this situation. HM \n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nTreasury has also delegated powers to the UK\xe2\x80\x99s financial services \nregulators to address deficiencies in the regulators\xe2\x80\x99 rulebooks \narising as a result of exit, and to the EU Binding Technical Stan-\ndards that will become part of retained EU law.\n\nCredit Suisse is working to address the implications of the con-\nsequences of these changes and to minimize disruption for our \nclients. Adverse changes to any of these arrangements, and even \nuncertainty over potential changes during any period of negotia-\ntion, could potentially impact our results in the UK or other mar-\nkets we serve.\n\nRegulatory framework\n\nThe principal regulatory structures that apply to our operations are \ndiscussed below.\n\nGlobal initiatives\n\nTotal Loss-Absorbing Capacity\nOn January 1, 2019, the final FSB TLAC standard for G-SIBs \nbecame effective, subject to a phase-in until January 1, 2022. \nThe purpose of the standard is to enhance the ability of regula-\ntors to recapitalize a G-SIB at the point of non-viability in a manner \nthat minimizes systemic disruption, preserves critical functions and \nlimits the exposure of public sector funds. TLAC-eligible instru-\nments include instruments that count towards satisfying minimum \nregulatory capital requirements, as well as long-term unsecured \ndebt instruments that have remaining maturities of no less than \none year, are subordinated by statute, corporate structure or con-\ntract to certain excluded liabilities, including deposits, are held \nby unaffiliated third parties and meet certain other requirements. \nExcluding any applicable regulatory capital buffers that are oth-\nerwise required, the minimum TLAC requirement is at least 16% \nof a G-SIB\xe2\x80\x99s RWA as of January 1, 2019, and will increase to at \nleast 18% as of January 1, 2022. In addition, the minimum TLAC \nrequirement must be at least 6% of the Basel III leverage ratio \ndenominator as of January 1, 2019, and at least 6.75% as of \nJanuary 1, 2022.\n\nIn Switzerland, effective July 1, 2016, the Swiss Federal Council \nadopted the revised Capital Adequacy Ordinance implementing the \nFSB\xe2\x80\x99s TLAC standard.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cLiquidity and funding management\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cCapital management\xe2\x80\x9d in III \n\xe2\x80\x93 Treasury, Risk, Balance sheet and Off-balance sheet for information regard-\ning our current regulatory framework and expected changes to this framework \naffecting capital and liquidity standards.\n\nIn the US, the Fed has adopted a final rule that implements \nthe FSB\xe2\x80\x99s TLAC standard. The final rule requires, among other \nthings, the US IHCs of non-US G-SIBs, such as Credit Suisse\xe2\x80\x99s \nUS IHC, to maintain minimum amounts of \xe2\x80\x9cinternal\xe2\x80\x9d TLAC, a \nTLAC buffer and long-term debt satisfying certain eligibility cri-\nteria, commencing January 1, 2019. The entity designated as \nCredit Suisse\xe2\x80\x99s US IHC is required to issue all TLAC debt instru-\nments to a foreign parent entity (a non-US entity that controls \nthe IHC) or another foreign affiliate that is wholly owned by its \n\nforeign parent. The final rules also impose limitations on the types \nof financial transactions in which the entity designated as Credit \nSuisse\xe2\x80\x99s US IHC can engage.\n\nIn the UK, the Bank of England published its statement of policy \non its approach to establishing the requirement under the BRRD \nfor certain UK entities, including Credit Suisse International (CSI) \nand Credit Suisse Securities Europe Limited (CSSEL), to main-\ntain the MREL requirement. Similar to the FSB\xe2\x80\x99s TLAC standard, \nthe MREL requirement obliges firms within the scope of the \nBRRD to maintain a minimum level of own funds and liabilities \nthat can be bailed in. The statement of policy reflects both the \nTLAC standards and the requirements of the European Banking \nAuthority (EBA)\xe2\x80\x99s Regulatory Technical Standards on MREL. It \ndoes not set TLAC requirements in addition to MREL. On June \n13, 2018, the Bank of England also published its final statement \nof policy on its approach to setting MREL, including its approach \non setting internal MREL. Under the statement of policy, inter-\nnal MREL requirements for UK material subsidiaries of non-UK \nG-SIBs, such as Credit Suisse, will be scaled between 75% and \n90% of external MREL based on factors including the resolu-\ntion strategy of the group and the home country\xe2\x80\x99s approach to \ninternal total loss-absorbing capacity calibration. Interim internal \nMREL requirements came into effect beginning January 1, 2019, \nand their full implementation will be phased in through January 1, \n2022.\n\nISDA Resolution Stay Protocols\nOn November 12, 2015, ISDA launched the ISDA 2015 Uni-\nversal Resolution Stay Protocol (ISDA 2015 Universal Protocol) \nand Credit Suisse voluntarily adhered to the ISDA 2015 Univer-\nsal Protocol at the time of its launch. By adhering to the ISDA \n2015 Universal Protocol, parties agree to be bound by, or \xe2\x80\x9copt \nin\xe2\x80\x9d, to certain existing and forthcoming special resolution regimes \nto ensure that cross-border derivatives and securities financ-\ning transactions are subject to statutory stays on affiliate-linked \ndefault and early termination rights in the event a bank counter-\nparty enters into resolution, regardless of its governing law. These \nstays are intended to facilitate an orderly resolution of a troubled \nbank. Statutory resolution regimes have been implemented in \nseveral jurisdictions, including Switzerland, the US and the EU. \nThese regimes provide resolution authorities with a broad set of \ntools and powers to resolve a troubled bank, including the ability \nto temporarily stay, and under certain circumstances permanently \noverride, the termination rights of counterparties of a bank and its \naffiliates in the event the bank enters into resolution. The ISDA \n2015 Universal Protocol introduces similar stays and overrides in \nthe event that an affiliate of an adhering party becomes subject \nto proceedings under the US Bankruptcy Code, under which no \nsuch stays or overrides currently exist.\n\nAlthough other large banking groups have also adhered to the \nISDA 2015 Universal Protocol, it is anticipated that buy-side or \nend-user counterparties of Credit Suisse will not voluntarily give \nup early termination rights and will therefore not adhere to the \nISDA 2015 Universal Protocol. In order to expand the scope of \nparties and transactions covered by the ISDA 2015 Universal \n\nRegulation and supervision\n\n35\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nProtocol or similar contractual arrangements, the G20 commit-\nted to introducing regulations requiring large banking groups to \ninclude ISDA 2015 Universal Protocol-like provisions in certain \nfinancial contracts when facing counterparties under foreign laws. \nCertain G20 member nations, including the US, introduced such \nrequirements in 2015, 2016 and 2017.\n\nIn Switzerland, the Swiss Federal Council introduced amend-\nments to the Ordinance on Banks and Savings Banks (Bank-\ning Ordinance) that require banks, including Credit Suisse, to \ninclude terms in certain of their contracts (and in certain con-\ntracts entered into by their subsidiaries) that are not governed by \nSwiss law or that provide for jurisdiction outside of Switzerland \nthat ensure that FINMA\xe2\x80\x99s stay powers under the Swiss Fed-\neral Act on Banks and Savings Banks of November 8, 1934, \nas amended (Bank Law), would be enforceable with respect to \nsuch contracts. These requirements have been set forth in the \nBanking Ordinance since January 1, 2016. A partial revision of \nthe Ordinance of FINMA on the Insolvency of Banks and Securi-\nties Dealers (FINMA Banking Insolvency Ordinance) entered into \neffect on April 1, 2017. The rule only affects an exhaustive list \nof contracts whose continued existence is essential for a bank \nrequiring restructuring. The listed contracts are customary in the \nfinancial market and include, in particular, contracts governing \nthe purchase, sale, lending and repurchase of certain underly-\ning securities. Contracts entered into by foreign group entities \nare only subject to the rule if, among other things, the respective \nfinancial contract is guaranteed or otherwise secured by a bank or \nsecurities dealer domiciled in Switzerland. Certain contracts, e.g. \ncontracts with individuals as well as for the placement of financial \ninstruments in the market, are excluded. The list of contracts is \ninternationally harmonized and broadly in line with the definition of \nfinancial contracts in accordance with the BRRD.\n\nIn the UK, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) published \nfinal rules in November 2015 requiring UK entities, including CSI \nand CSSEL, to ensure that their counterparties under a broad \nrange of financial arrangements are subject to the stays on early \ntermination rights under the UK Banking Act that would be appli-\ncable upon their resolution. UK entities have been required to \ncomply with these rules from June 1, 2016 for contracts where \nthe counterparty is a credit institution or an investment firm, \nand from January 1, 2017 in respect of contracts with all other \ncounterparties.\n\nISDA has developed another protocol, the ISDA Resolution Stay \nJurisdictional Modular Protocol to facilitate market-wide com-\npliance with these new requirements by both dealers, such as \nCredit Suisse, and their counterparties.\n\nIn the US, in 2017, the Fed, the FDIC and the OCC each issued \nfinal rules designed to improve the resolvability of US headquar-\ntered G-SIBs and the US operations of non-US G-SIBs, such \nas our US operations. These final rules require covered entities \nto modify their QFCs to obtain agreement of counterparties that \n(1) their QFCs are subject to the stays on early termination rights \nunder the Orderly Liquidation Authority and the Federal Deposit \n\n36\n\nRegulation and supervision\n\nInsurance Act, which is similar to requirements introduced in other \njurisdictions to which we are already subject, and (2) certain affil-\niate-linked default rights would be limited or overridden if an affili-\nate of the G-SIB entered proceedings under the US Bankruptcy \nCode or other insolvency or resolution regimes. Covered QFCs \nmust be conformed to the rules\xe2\x80\x99 requirements starting January 1, \n2019, with full compliance by January 1, 2020. ISDA has devel-\noped the ISDA US Protocol to facilitate compliance with the final \nrules. Credit Suisse\xe2\x80\x99s US operations are in the process of having \nall of their covered entities adhere to the ISDA US Protocol to \namend their QFCs with adhering counterparties to comply with \nthe final rules.\n\nSwitzerland\n\nBanking regulation and supervision\nAlthough Credit Suisse Group is not a bank according to the \nBank Law and the Banking Ordinance, the Group is required, \npursuant to the provisions on consolidated supervision of financial \ngroups and conglomerates of the Bank Law, to comply with cer-\ntain requirements for banks. Such requirements include capital \nadequacy, loss-absorbing capacity, solvency and risk concentra-\ntion on a consolidated basis, and certain reporting obligations. \nOur banks in Switzerland are regulated by FINMA on a legal \nentity basis and, if applicable, on a consolidated basis.\n\nOur banks in Switzerland operate under banking licenses granted \nby FINMA pursuant to the Bank Law and the Banking Ordinance. \nIn addition, certain of these banks hold securities dealer licenses \ngranted by FINMA pursuant to the Swiss Federal Act on Stock \nExchanges and Securities Trading (SESTA). \n\nFINMA is the sole bank supervisory authority in Switzerland \nand is independent from the Swiss National Bank (SNB). Under \nthe Bank Law, FINMA is responsible for the supervision of the \nSwiss banking system. The SNB is responsible for implementing \nthe government\xe2\x80\x99s monetary policy relating to banks and securi-\nties dealers and for ensuring the stability of the financial system. \nUnder the \xe2\x80\x9dToo Big to Fail\xe2\x80\x9d legislation, the SNB is also respon-\nsible for determining which banks in Switzerland are systemically \nrelevant banks and which functions are systemically relevant in \nSwitzerland. The SNB has identified the Group on a consolidated \nbasis as a systemically relevant bank for the purposes of Swiss \nlaw.\n\nOur banks in Switzerland are subject to close and continuous \nprudential supervision and direct audits by FINMA. Under the \nBank Law, our banks are subject to inspection and supervision \nby an independent auditing firm recognized by FINMA, which \nis appointed by the bank\xe2\x80\x99s shareholder meeting and required to \nperform annual audits of the bank\xe2\x80\x99s financial statements and to \nassess whether the bank is in compliance with laws and regu-\nlations, including the Bank Law, the Banking Ordinance and \nFINMA regulations.\n\nCredit Suisse is subject to the Basel III framework, as implemented \nin Switzerland, as well as Swiss legislation and regulations for \n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nsystemically important banks, which include capital, liquidity, lever-\nage and large exposure requirements, and rules for emergency \nplans designed to maintain systemically relevant functions in the \nevent of threatened insolvency.\n\nOur regulatory capital is calculated on the basis of accounting \nprinciples generally accepted in the US, with certain adjustments \nrequired by, or agreed with, FINMA.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cLiquidity and funding management\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cCapital management\xe2\x80\x9d in \nIII \xe2\x80\x93 Treasury, Risk, Balance sheet and Off-balance sheet for further informa-\ntion regarding our current regulatory framework and expected changes to this \nframework affecting capital and liquidity standards.\n\nUnder Swiss banking law, banks and securities dealers are \nrequired to manage risk concentration within specific limits. \nAggregated credit exposure to any single counterparty or a group \nof related counterparties must bear an adequate relationship \nto the bank\xe2\x80\x99s adjusted eligible capital (for systemically relevant \nbanks like us, to their core tier 1 capital) taking into account \ncounterparty risks and risk mitigation instruments.\n\nUnder the Bank Law and SESTA, Swiss banks and securi-\nties dealers are obligated to keep confidential the existence and \nall aspects of their relationships with customers. These cus-\ntomer confidentiality laws do not, however, provide protection \nwith respect to criminal offenses such as insider trading, money \nlaundering, terrorist financing activities, tax fraud or evasion or \nprevent the disclosure of information to courts and administrative \nauthorities.\n\nSwiss rules and regulations to combat money laundering and ter-\nrorist financing are comprehensive and require banks and other \nfinancial intermediaries to thoroughly verify and document cus-\ntomer identity before commencing business. In addition, these \nrules and regulations include obligations to maintain appropriate \npolicies for dealings with politically exposed persons and proce-\ndures and controls to detect and prevent money laundering and \nterrorist financing activities, including reporting suspicious activi-\nties to authorities.\n\nIn addition, Switzerland has stringent anti-corruption and anti-\nbribery laws related to Swiss and foreign public officials as well as \npersons in the private sector. \n\nCompensation design and its implementation and disclosure have \nbeen required to comply with standards promulgated by FINMA \nunder its Circular on Remuneration Schemes, as updated from \ntime to time.\n\nSecurities dealer and asset management regulation and \nsupervision \nOur securities dealer activities in Switzerland are conducted \nprimarily through the Bank and are subject to regulation under \nSESTA, which regulates all aspects of the securities dealer busi-\nness in Switzerland, including regulatory capital, risk concentra-\ntion, sales and trading practices, record-keeping requirements \nand procedures and periodic reporting procedures. Securities \ndealers are supervised by FINMA. On June 15, 2018, the Swiss \n\nParliament adopted the FinIA, which is expected to govern all \naspects of the securities dealer business in Switzerland instead of \nthe SESTA, beginning January 1, 2020.\n\nOur asset management activities in Switzerland, which include \nthe establishment and administration of mutual funds registered \nfor public distribution, are conducted under the supervision of \nFINMA. Effective January 1, 2020, our activities as asset man-\nager of collective assets will also be governed by the FinIA.\n\nResolution regime \nThe FINMA Banking Insolvency Ordinance governs resolution \n(i.e., restructuring or liquidation) procedures of Swiss banks and \nsecurities dealers, such as Credit Suisse AG and Credit Suisse \n(Schweiz) AG, and of Swiss-domiciled parent companies of finan-\ncial groups, such as Credit Suisse Group AG, and certain other \nunregulated Swiss-domiciled companies belonging to financial \ngroups. Instead of prescribing a particular resolution concept, the \nFINMA Banking Insolvency Ordinance provides FINMA with a \nsignificant amount of authority and discretion in the case of reso-\nlution, as well as various restructuring tools from which FINMA \nmay choose.\n\nFINMA may open resolution proceedings if there is an impend-\ning insolvency because there is justified concern that the relevant \nSwiss bank (or Swiss-domiciled parent companies of financial \ngroups and certain other unregulated Swiss-domiciled companies \nbelonging to financial groups) is over-indebted, has serious liquid-\nity problems or no longer fulfills capital adequacy requirements. \nResolution proceedings may only take the form of restructuring \n(rather than liquidation) proceedings if (i) the recovery of, or the \ncontinued provision of individual banking services by, the relevant \nbank appears likely and (ii) the creditors of the relevant bank are \nlikely better off in restructuring proceedings than in liquidation \nproceedings. All realizable assets in the relevant entity\xe2\x80\x99s posses-\nsion will be subject to such proceedings, regardless of where they \nare located.\n\nIf FINMA were to open restructuring proceedings with respect to \nCredit Suisse AG, Credit Suisse (Schweiz) AG or Credit Suisse \nGroup AG, it would have discretion to take decisive actions, \nincluding (i) transferring the assets of the banks or Credit Suisse \nGroup AG, as applicable, or a portion thereof, together with its \ndebt and other liabilities, or a portion thereof, and contracts, to \nanother entity, (ii) staying (for a maximum of two working days) \nthe termination of, and the exercise of rights to terminate net-\nting rights, rights to enforce or dispose of certain types of col-\nlateral or rights to transfer claims, liabilities or certain collateral, \nunder contracts to which the banks or Credit Suisse Group AG, \nas applicable, is a party, (iii) converting the debt of the banks or \nCredit Suisse Group AG, as applicable, into equity (debt-to-equity \nswap), and/or (iv) partially or fully writing off the obligations of the \nbanks or Credit Suisse Group AG, as applicable (haircut).\n\nPrior to any debt-to equity swap or haircut, outstanding equity \ncapital and debt instruments issued by Credit Suisse AG, Credit \nSuisse (Schweiz) AG or Credit Suisse Group AG that are part of \n\nRegulation and supervision\n\n37\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nits regulatory capital (including outstanding high trigger capital \ninstruments and low trigger capital instruments) must be con-\nverted or written off (as applicable) and cancelled. Any debt-\nto-equity swap, (but not any haircut) would have to follow the \nhierarchy of claims to the extent such debt is not excluded from \nsuch conversion by the FINMA Banking Insolvency Ordinance. \nContingent liabilities of Credit Suisse AG, Credit Suisse (Schweiz) \nAG or Credit Suisse Group AG such as guarantees could also \nbe subjected to a debt-to-equity swap or a haircut, to the extent \namounts are due and payable thereunder at any time during \nrestructuring proceedings.\n\nFor systemically relevant institutions such as Credit Suisse AG, \nCredit Suisse (Schweiz) AG and Credit Suisse Group AG, creditors \nhave no right to reject the restructuring plan approved by FINMA.\n\nSupervision\nThe Federal Act on Financial Market Infrastructure and Market \nConduct in Securities and Derivatives Trading (also known as \n\xe2\x80\x9cFMIA\xe2\x80\x9d) governs the organization and operation of financial mar-\nket infrastructures and the conduct of financial market partici-\npants in securities and derivatives trading. FMIA, along with the \nFinancial Market Infrastructure Ordinance (also known as \xe2\x80\x9cFMIO\xe2\x80\x9d) \ncame into effect on January 1, 2016. However, financial market \ninfrastructures and the operators of organized trading facilities \nwere granted different transitional periods to comply with various \nnew duties, including those associated with the publication of pre- \nand post-trade transparency information and with high-frequency \ntrading. Under the FMIA, FINMA was designated to determine \nthe timing of the introduction of a clearing obligation and to \nspecify the categories of derivatives covered. Accordingly, on \nSeptember 1, 2018, the revised Ordinance of the Swiss Financial \nMarket Supervisory Authority on Financial Market Infrastructures \nand Market Conduct in Securities and Derivatives Trading (FMIO-\nFINMA) entered into force, introducing a mandatory clearing obli-\ngation for standardized interest-rate and credit derivatives traded \nover the counter (OTC) and making effective, as of such date, the \ndeadlines for the first clearing obligations laid down in the FMIO, \ni.e., six months, twelve months or eighteen months, depending on \nthe categories of derivatives and the type of counterparty.\n\nTax\nAdministrative assistance in tax matters\nThe Multilateral Convention on Mutual Administrative Assistance \nin Tax Matters (MAC) entered into force and became applicable \nas of January 1, 2018. Under the MAC, Switzerland is required to \nexchange information in tax matters both spontaneously in certain \ncases as well as upon request. Furthermore, the revised Federal \nAct on International Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters and \nthe revised Federal Ordinance on International Administrative Assis-\ntance in Tax Matters (OIAA) entered into force, which provide the \nprocedural rules for international administrative assistance on tax \nmatters based on either the MAC or under bilateral double taxation \ntreaties of Switzerland. In exceptional cases, the Swiss legislation \npermits exchange of information before the taxpayer concerned is \ninformed. Under the MAC (and as clarified in the OIAA), Switzer-\nland commenced for tax periods from January 1, 2018 onwards to \n\n38\n\nRegulation and supervision\n\nautomatically exchange information on certain advance tax rulings \nwithin the scope of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation \nand Development (OECD) and the Group of Twenty (G20) project \nto combat base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS).\n\nOn June 10, 2016, the Swiss Federal Council submitted to the \nSwiss Parliament an amendment of the Federal Act on Interna-\ntional Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters for adoption to \nalso allow administrative assistance for requests based on stolen \ndata, however, only if the stolen data has been obtained by regu-\nlar administrative assistance or from public sources. The Swiss \nParliament has yet to debate the proposed new law. \n\nOn December 1, 2017, the Multilateral Competent Author-\nity Agreement on the Exchange of Country-by-Country Reports \n(CbCR) as well as the implementing Swiss federal legislation \nentered into force, which is the Federal Act on the International \nAutomatic Exchange of Country by Country Reports of Multina-\ntionals and the Federal Ordinance on the International Auto-\nmatic Exchange of Country by Country Reports of Multinationals. \nUnder the CbCR and the implementing legislation, multinational \ngroups of companies in Switzerland will have to prepare country-\nby-country reports for the first time for the 2018 tax year. The \nreports will be exchanged by Switzerland starting in 2020. On a \nvoluntary basis, multinational groups of companies may prepare, \nand are permitted to submit, country-by-country reports for the \n2016 and 2017 tax periods. Any such reports were exchanged \nfor the first time in 2018.\n\nAutomatic exchange of information in tax matters\nSwitzerland has concluded a multilateral agreement with the EU \non the international automatic exchange of information (AEOI) \nin tax matters (the AEOI Agreement), which applies to all 28 \nmember states and also Gibraltar. Further, Switzerland signed \nthe multilateral competent authority agreement on the automatic \nexchange of financial account information (MCAA), and based \non the MCAA, a number of bilateral AEOI agreements with other \ncountries also became effective. Based on the AEOI Agreement, \nthe bilateral AEOI agreements and the implementing laws of Swit-\nzerland, in 2017 Switzerland began to collect data in respect of \nfinancial assets held in, and income derived thereon and credited \nto, accounts or deposits with a paying agent in Switzerland for the \nbenefit of residents in a EU member state or Gibraltar or a treaty \nstate, and began to exchange such data in 2018. Switzerland has \nsigned and will sign further AEOI agreements with additional coun-\ntries. An up-to-date list of the AEOI agreements of Switzerland in \neffect or signed and becoming effective can be found on the web-\nsite of the State Secretariat for International Financial Matters.\n\nWithholding tax reforms\nOn January 1, 2017, the revised Withholding Tax Act entered \ninto force. It extends the exemption of interest paid on contin-\ngent convertible bonds and write-down bonds of banks or group \ncompanies of finance groups which were approved by FINMA \nand issued between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2016, \nto issuances between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2021. \nIt also exempts interest paid on TLAC instruments approved \n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nby FINMA for purposes of meeting regulatory requirements \nwhich have been or will be issued between January 1, 2017 and \nDecember 31, 2021, or have been issued prior to January 1, \n2017 where the foreign issuer thereof will be substituted for a \nSwiss issuer between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2021.\n\nStamp tax reforms\nOn January 1, 2017, the revised Stamp Tax Act entered into \nforce. The revision introduced an exemption from the 1% issu-\nance stamp tax for equity securities in banks or group compa-\nnies of a financial group issued in connection with the conversion \nof TLAC instruments into equity, in addition to the exemption for \nequity securities in banks issued from conversion capital.\n\nUS\n\nBanking regulation and supervision\nOur banking operations are subject to extensive federal and state \nregulation and supervision in the US. Our direct US offices are \ncomposed of our New York Branch and representative offices in \nCalifornia. Each of these offices is licensed with, and subject to \nexamination and regulation by, the state banking authority in the \nstate in which it is located.\n\nOur New York Branch is licensed by the New York Superinten-\ndent of Financial Services (Superintendent), examined by the \nNew York Department of Financial Services (DFS), and subject \nto laws and regulations applicable to a foreign bank operating a \nNew York branch. Under the New York Banking Law, our New \nYork Branch must maintain eligible assets with banks in the state \nof New York. The amount of eligible assets required, which is \nexpressed as a percentage of third-party liabilities, could increase \nif our New York Branch is no longer designated well rated by the \nSuperintendent.\n\nThe New York Banking Law authorizes the Superintendent to \nseize our New York Branch and all of Credit Suisse AG\xe2\x80\x99s business \nand property in New York State (which includes property of our \nNew York Branch, wherever it may be located, and all of Credit \nSuisse AG\xe2\x80\x99s property situated in New York State) under circum-\nstances generally including violations of law, unsafe or unsound \npractices or insolvency. In liquidating or dealing with our New York \nBranch\xe2\x80\x99s business after taking possession, the Superintendent \nwould only accept for payment the claims of depositors and other \ncreditors (unaffiliated with us) that arose out of transactions with \nour New York Branch. After the claims of those creditors were \npaid out of the business and property of the Bank in New York, \nthe Superintendent would turn over the remaining assets, if any, \nto us or our liquidator or receiver. \n\nUnder New York Banking Law and US federal banking laws, our \nNew York Branch is generally subject to single borrower lending \nlimits expressed as a percentage of the worldwide capital of the \nBank. Under the Dodd-Frank Act, lending limits take into account \ncredit exposure arising from derivative transactions, securities \nborrowing and lending transactions and repurchase and reverse \nrepurchase agreements with counterparties.\n\nOur operations are also subject to reporting and examination \nrequirements under US federal banking laws. Our US non-\nbanking operations are subject to examination by the Fed in its \ncapacity as our US umbrella supervisor. The New York Branch is \nalso subject to examination by the Fed and is subject to federal \nbanking law requirements and limitations on the acceptance and \nmaintenance of deposits. Because the New York Branch does \nnot engage in retail deposit taking, it is not a member of, and its \ndeposits are not insured by, the FDIC.\n\nUS federal banking laws provide that a state-licensed branch \n(such as the New York Branch) or agency of a foreign bank may \nnot, as a general matter, engage as principal in any type of activ-\nity that is not permissible for a federally licensed branch or agency \nof a foreign bank unless the Fed has determined that such activity \nis consistent with sound banking practice. In addition, regulations \nwhich the Fed may adopt (including at the recommendation of the \nFSOC) could affect the nature of the activities which the Bank \n(including the New York Branch) may conduct, and may impose \nrestrictions and limitations on the conduct of such activities.\n\nThe Fed may terminate the activities of a US branch or agency of \na foreign bank if it finds that the foreign bank: (i) is not subject to \ncomprehensive supervision in its home country; (ii) has violated \nthe law or engaged in an unsafe or unsound banking practice in \nthe US; or (iii) for a foreign bank that presents a risk to the stabil-\nity of the US financial system, the home country of the foreign \nbank has not adopted, or made demonstrable progress toward \nadopting, an appropriate system of financial regulation to mitigate \nsuch risk.\n\nCredit Suisse Group and the Bank became financial holding \ncompanies for purposes of US federal banking law in 2000 and, \nas a result, may engage in a broad range of non-banking activi-\nties in the US, including insurance, securities, private equity \nand other financial activities, in each case subject to regulatory \nrequirements and limitations. Credit Suisse Group is still required \nto obtain the prior approval of the Fed (and potentially other US \nbanking regulators) before acquiring, directly or indirectly, the \nownership or control of more than 5% of any class of voting \nshares of (or otherwise controlling) any US bank, bank holding \ncompany or many other US depositary institutions and their hold-\ning companies, and as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, before \nmaking certain acquisitions involving large non-bank companies. \nThe New York Branch is also restricted from engaging in cer-\ntain tying arrangements involving products and services, and in \ncertain transactions with certain of its affiliates. If Credit Suisse \nGroup or the Bank ceases to be well-capitalized or well-man-\naged under applicable Fed rules, or otherwise fails to meet any \nof the requirements for financial holding company status, it may \nbe required to discontinue certain financial activities or terminate \nits New York Branch. Credit Suisse Group\xe2\x80\x99s ability to undertake \nacquisitions permitted for financial holding companies could also \nbe adversely affected.\n\nAs mentioned above, Credit Suisse is also subject to the so-\ncalled \xe2\x80\x9cVolcker Rule\xe2\x80\x9d, which limits the ability of banking entities to \n\nRegulation and supervision\n\n39\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nsponsor or invest in certain private equity or hedge funds, broadly \ndefined, and to engage in certain types of proprietary trading \nfor their own account. These restrictions are subject to certain \nexclusions and exemptions, including with respect to underwrit-\ning, market-making, risk-mitigating hedging and certain asset and \nfund management activities, and with respect to certain transac-\ntions and investments occurring solely outside of the US. The \nVolcker Rule requires banking entities to establish an extensive \narray of compliance policies, procedures and quantitative metrics \nreporting designed to ensure and monitor compliance with restric-\ntions under the Volcker Rule. It also requires an annual attestation \neither by the CEO of the top-tier FBO or the senior management \nofficer in the US as to the implementation of a compliance pro-\ngram reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the Vol-\ncker Rule. The Volcker Rule\xe2\x80\x99s implementing regulations became \neffective in April 2014 and Credit Suisse was generally required \nto come into compliance with the Volcker Rule by July 2015, with \nthe exception of \xe2\x80\x9clegacy\xe2\x80\x9d investments in, and bank relationships \nwith, certain private funds, that were in place prior to December \n31, 2013, for which the Fed extended the compliance deadline \nto July 21, 2017. In April 2017, the Fed granted Credit Suisse \nan extended transition period to conform investments in certain \nilliquid funds under the Volcker Rule for an additional five years \n(i.e., until July 21, 2022). Credit Suisse has implemented a Vol-\ncker Rule compliance program reasonably designed to satisfy the \nrequirements of the Volcker Rule. The Volcker Rule\xe2\x80\x99s implement-\ning regulations are highly complex and may be subject to further \nrulemaking, regulatory interpretation and guidance, and its full \nimpact will not be known with certainty for some time. \n\nFed regulations implementing the Dodd-Frank Act required Credit \nSuisse to create a single US IHC to hold all of its US subsidiar-\nies with limited exceptions by July 1, 2017. The IHC requirement \ndoes not apply to the New York Branch. Credit Suisse\xe2\x80\x99s US IHC \nis subject to US risk-based capital and leverage requirements \nthat are largely consistent with the Basel III framework published \nby the BCBS, though they diverge in several important respects \ndue to the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act, and is subject \nto capital planning and capital stress testing requirements under \nthe Dodd-Frank Act and the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s annual Comprehensive Capital \nAnalysis and Review (CCAR). In June 2018, the Fed released \nresults of its annual CCAR stress tests, publicly releasing results \nfor Credit Suisse\xe2\x80\x99s US IHC for the first time. Credit Suisse\xe2\x80\x99s US \nIHC was projected to maintain capital ratios above minimum reg-\nulatory requirements in the adverse and severely adverse CCAR \nstress scenarios, and the Fed did not object to its proposed capi-\ntal plan. As part of the stress testing requirements of the Dodd-\nFrank Act, Credit Suisse\xe2\x80\x99s US IHC was also required to conduct \na mid-cycle stress test using a set of internally developed macro-\neconomic scenarios and submit the results to the Fed in October \n2018. As disclosed, Credit Suisse\xe2\x80\x99s US IHC was projected to \nmaintain capital ratios above minimum regulatory requirements \nunder the internally developed severely adverse scenario. \n\nUS operations of Credit Suisse (including Credit Suisse\xe2\x80\x99s US IHC \nand the New York Branch) are subject to other new prudential \nrequirements, including with respect to liquidity risk management, \nseparate liquidity buffers for each of Credit Suisse\xe2\x80\x99s US IHC \nand the New York Branch, liquidity stress testing and SCCLs. \nUnder proposals that remain under consideration, the combined \nUS operations of Credit Suisse may become subject to an early \nremediation regime which could be triggered by risk-based capi-\ntal, leverage, stress tests, liquidity, risk management and mar-\nket indicators. The Fed has also indicated that it is considering \nfuture rulemakings that could apply the US rules implementing \nthe Basel III liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable fund-\ning ratio (NSFR) to the US operations of certain large FBOs, and \nthat could further tailor the US prudential standards applicable to \nFBOs based on size, complexity and risk. \n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cLiquidity and funding management\xe2\x80\x9d in III \xe2\x80\x93 Treasury, Risk, Balance \n\nsheet and Off-balance sheet for further information on Basel III LCR and \nNSFR.\n\nA major focus of US policy and regulation relating to financial \ninstitutions has been to combat money laundering and terror-\nist financing. These laws and regulations impose obligations to \nmaintain appropriate policies, procedures and controls to detect, \nprevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing, verify \nthe identity of customers and comply with economic sanctions. \nAny failure to maintain and implement adequate programs to \ncombat money laundering and terrorist financing, and violations of \nsuch economic sanctions, laws and regulations, could have seri-\nous legal and reputational consequences. We take our obligations \nto prevent money laundering and terrorist financing in the US and \nglobally very seriously, while appropriately respecting and protect-\ning the confidentiality of clients. We have policies, procedures and \ntraining intended to ensure that our employees comply with \xe2\x80\x9cknow \nyour customer\xe2\x80\x9d regulations and understand when a client relation-\nship or business should be evaluated as higher risk for us.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires issuers with listed securities to \nestablish a claw-back policy to recoup erroneously awarded com-\npensation in the event of an accounting restatement but no final \nrules have been adopted.\n\nBroker-dealer and asset management regulation and \nsupervision \nOur US broker-dealers are subject to extensive regulation by US \nregulatory authorities. The SEC is the federal agency primar-\nily responsible for the regulation of broker-dealers, investment \nadvisers and investment companies. In addition, the US Treasury \nhas the authority to promulgate rules relating to US Treasury and \ngovernment agency securities, the Municipal Securities Rulemak-\ning Board (MSRB) has the authority to promulgate rules relating \nto municipal securities, and the MSRB also promulgates regula-\ntions applicable to certain securities credit transactions. In addi-\ntion, broker-dealers are subject to regulation by securities indus-\ntry self-regulatory organizations, including the Financial Industry \nRegulatory Authority (FINRA), and by state securities authorities. \n\nCredit Suisse\xe2\x80\x99s US IHC is also subject to additional requirements \nunder the Fed\xe2\x80\x99s final TLAC framework for IHCs, described above. \nIn addition, both Credit Suisse\xe2\x80\x99s US IHC itself and the combined \n\nOur US broker-dealers are registered with the SEC and our pri-\nmary US broker-dealer is registered in all 50 states, the District \n\n40\n\nRegulation and supervision\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nof Columbia, Puerto Rico and the US Virgin Islands. Our US reg-\nistered entities are subject to extensive regulatory requirements \nthat apply to all aspects of their business activity, including, where \napplicable: capital requirements; the use and safekeeping of \ncustomer funds and securities; the suitability of customer invest-\nments; record-keeping and reporting requirements; employee-\nrelated matters; limitations on extensions of credit in securities \ntransactions; prevention and detection of money laundering and \nterrorist financing; procedures relating to research analyst inde-\npendence; procedures for the clearance and settlement of trades; \nand communications with the public.\n\nOur US broker-dealers are also subject to the SEC\xe2\x80\x99s net capital \nrule, which requires broker-dealers to maintain a specified level of \nminimum net capital in relatively liquid form. Compliance with the \nnet capital rule could limit operations that require intensive use of \ncapital, such as underwriting and trading activities and the financ-\ning of customer account balances and also could restrict our ability \nto withdraw capital from our broker-dealers. Most of our US bro-\nker-dealers are also subject to additional net capital requirements \nof FINRA and, in some cases, other self-regulatory organizations.\n\nOur securities and asset management businesses include legal \nentities registered and regulated as a broker-dealer and invest-\nment adviser by the SEC. The SEC-registered mutual funds that \nwe advise are subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940. \nFor pension fund customers, we are subject to ERISA and similar \nstate statutes. \n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also requires broader regulation of hedge \nfunds and private equity funds, as well as credit rating agencies.\n\nDerivative regulation and supervision \nThe CFTC is the federal agency primarily responsible for the reg-\nulation of futures commission merchants, commodity pool opera-\ntors, commodity trading advisors and introducing brokers, among \nother regulatory categories. With the effectiveness of the Dodd-\nFrank Act, CFTC oversight was expanded to include persons \nengaging in a relevant activity with respect to swaps, and regis-\ntration categories were added for swap dealers and major swap \nparticipants. For derivatives activities, these CFTC registrants \nare subject to industry self-regulatory organizations, such as the \nNational Futures Association (NFA), which has been designated \nby the CFTC as a registered futures association.\n\nEach of CSI, CSSEL and Credit Suisse Capital LLC (CS Capital) \nis registered with the CFTC as a swap dealer as a result of its \napplicable swap activities and is therefore subject to requirements \nrelating to reporting, record-keeping, swap confirmation, swap \nportfolio reconciliation and compression, mandatory clearing, \nmandatory on-facility trading, swap trading relationship documen-\ntation, external business conduct, risk management, chief compli-\nance officer duties and reports and internal controls. However, \nwhere permitted by comparability determinations by the CFTC \nor in reliance on no-action letters issued by the CFTC, non-US \nswap dealers, including CSI and CSSEL, can comply with certain \nrequirements through substituted compliance with EU regulations. \n\nThe CFTC has also stated that it intends to grant new substi-\ntuted compliance and exemption orders and no-action letters at \nthe point of the UK\xe2\x80\x99s withdrawal from the EU, which would permit \nCSI and CSSEL to satisfy such requirements by complying with \nrelevant UK regulations.\n\nAs registered swap dealers that are not banks, CSSEL and CS \nCapital are also subject to the CFTC\xe2\x80\x99s margin rules for uncleared \nswaps. As a non-US swap dealer, CSSEL is only subject to these \nrules in connection with its uncleared swaps with US persons, \nnon-US persons guaranteed by US persons, and certain non-US \nswap dealer subsidiaries of US persons. As a registered swap \ndealer that is a foreign bank, CSI is subject to the margin rules \nfor uncleared swaps and security-based swaps of the Fed, and \nCSI likewise is only subject to these rules in connection with its \nuncleared swaps and security-based swaps with US persons, \nnon-US persons guaranteed by US persons, and certain non-US \nswap dealer subsidiaries of US persons. Both of these margin \nrules are following a phased implementation schedule. Since \nMarch 1, 2017, CSI, CSSEL and CS Capital have been required \nto comply with variation margin requirements with covered entities \nunder these rules, requiring the exchange of daily mark-to-market \nmargin with all such covered entities. Initial margin requirements \nbegan phasing in annually for different counterparties from Sep-\ntember 1, 2016, with remaining phases relating to the application \nof initial margin requirements to market participants with group-\nwide notional derivatives exposure during the preceding March, \nApril and May of at least USD\xc2\xa0750 billion or at least USD\xc2\xa08 billion \non September 1, 2019 or September 1, 2020, respectively. The \nbroad expansion of initial margin requirements on September 1, \n2020 could have a significant adverse impact on our OTC deriva-\ntives business because of the large number of affected coun-\nterparties that might need to enter into new documentation and \nupgrade their systems in order to comply.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also mandates that the CFTC adopt capital \nrequirements for non-bank swap dealers (such as CSSEL and CS \nCapital), and the CFTC continues to consider proposed rules in \nthis area. Under the CFTC\xe2\x80\x99s most recent proposal, CSSEL and \nCS Capital could elect whether to satisfy capital requirements \nbased on Fed rules implementing Basel capital requirements or \nSEC rules similar to the capital requirements currently applicable \nto US broker-dealers, but in each case they would be subject to \nan additional capital requirement based on 8% of the initial mar-\ngin required for their derivatives positions. If the CFTC found EU \ncapital requirements to be comparable, or, following the UK\xe2\x80\x99s \nwithdrawal from the EU, if the CFTC found relevant UK capital \nrequirements to be comparable, CSSEL could satisfy the CFTC\xe2\x80\x99s \nrequirements through \xe2\x80\x9csubstituted compliance\xe2\x80\x9d with the EU or UK \nrequirements, as applicable. If the CFTC did not grant that com-\nparability determination, however, CSSEL could face a signifi-\ncant competitive disadvantage relative to non-US competitors not \nsubject to CFTC capital requirements due to the additional capital \nthat may be required under the CFTC\xe2\x80\x99s rules as proposed and the \nburdens associated with satisfying duplicative capital regimes. In \ncontrast, the Fed thus far has declined to apply additional capital \nrequirements to swap dealers that are foreign banks, such as CSI.\n\nRegulation and supervision\n\n41\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nThe CFTC continues to consider proposed rules with potential \nrevisions to its framework for the cross-border application of swap \ndealer regulations. In the meantime, key aspects of that frame-\nwork, such as the application of certain CFTC rules to swaps \nbetween non-US persons, remain subject to temporary no-action \nletters. Expiration of any of these letters without modifications to \nthe CFTC\xe2\x80\x99s guidance or permitting substituted compliance with \nthe EU rules could reduce the willingness of non-US counterpar-\nties to trade with CSI and CSSEL, which could negatively affect \nour swap trading revenue or necessitate changes to how we \norganize our swap business. We continue to monitor these devel-\nopments and prepare contingency plans to comply with the final \nguidance or rules once effective.\n\nOne of our US broker-dealers, Credit Suisse Securities (USA) \nLLC, is also registered as a futures commission merchant and \nsubject to the capital, segregation and other requirements of the \nCFTC and the NFA.\n\nOur asset management businesses include legal entities regis-\ntered and regulated as commodity pool operators and commod-\nity trading advisors by the CFTC and the NFA and therefore are \nsubject to disclosure, recordkeeping, reporting and other require-\nments of the CFTC and the NFA.\n\nThe Dodd-Frank Act mandates that the CFTC establish aggre-\ngate position limits for certain physical commodity futures con-\ntracts and economically equivalent swaps, and the CFTC contin-\nues to consider proposed rules in this area. If the CFTC adopted \nits most recent proposal, these position limit rules would require \nus to develop a costly compliance infrastructure and could reduce \nour ability to participate in the commodity derivatives markets, \nboth directly and on behalf of our clients.\n\nIn addition, in late 2018 the SEC began again to solicit com-\nments on its rules implementing the derivatives provisions of \nthe Dodd-Frank Act, and it is possible that the SEC will finalize \nsome of these rules during 2019. However, the timing remains \nunclear. While the SEC\xe2\x80\x99s proposals have largely paralleled many \nof the CFTC\xe2\x80\x99s rules, significant differences between the final \nCFTC and SEC rules could materially increase the compliance \ncosts associated with, and hinder the efficiency of, our equity \nand credit derivatives businesses with US persons. For example, \nsignificant differences between the SEC rules regarding capital, \nmargin and segregation requirements for OTC derivatives and \nrelated CFTC rules, as well as the cross-border application of \nSEC and CFTC rules, could have such effects. In particular, SEC \nrules applying public transaction reporting and external business \nconduct requirements to security-based swaps between non-US \npersons that are arranged, negotiated or executed by US person-\nnel could discourage non-US counterparties from entering into \nsuch transactions, unless the SEC permits substituted compli-\nance with non-US reporting or business conduct requirements. \nThe SEC requirements, as currently finalized, would take effect \nupon or shortly after security-based swap dealer registration, \nwhich will not be required until after the SEC completes several \n\nother pending rulemakings relating to security-based swap dealer \nregulation.\n\nFATCA \nPursuant to an agreement with the US Internal Revenue Service \n(IRS) entered into in compliance with the US Foreign Account \nTax Compliance Act (FATCA), Credit Suisse is required to identify \nand provide the IRS with information on accounts held by US per-\nsons and certain US-owned foreign entities, as well as to with-\nhold tax on payments made to foreign financial institutions (FFIs) \nthat are not in compliance with FATCA and account holders who \nfail to provide sufficient information to classify an account as a \nUS or non-US account. Switzerland and the United States have \nentered into a \xe2\x80\x9cModel 2\xe2\x80\x9d intergovernmental agreement to imple-\nment FATCA, pursuant to which US authorities may ask Swiss \nauthorities for administrative assistance in connection with group \nrequests where consent to provide information regarding poten-\ntial US accounts is not provided to FFIs, such as Credit Suisse. \nThe Swiss Federal Council announced on October 8, 2014 that \nit intends to negotiate a Model 1 intergovernmental agreement \nthat would replace the existing agreement and that would instead \nrequire FFIs in Switzerland to report US accounts to the Swiss \nauthorities, who would in turn report that information to the IRS. \nIt is unclear when negotiations will continue for the Model 1 inter-\ngovernmental agreement and when any new regime would come \ninto force. We are continuing to follow developments regarding \nFATCA closely and are coordinating with all relevant authorities.\n\nResolution regime \nThe Dodd-Frank Act also established an \xe2\x80\x9cOrderly Liquidation \nAuthority\xe2\x80\x9d, a regime for the orderly liquidation of systemically \nsignificant non-bank financial companies, which could poten-\ntially apply to certain of our US entities. The Secretary of the US \nTreasury may under certain circumstances appoint the FDIC as \nreceiver for a failing financial company in order to prevent risks \nto US financial stability. The FDIC would then have the author-\nity to charter a \xe2\x80\x9cbridge\xe2\x80\x9d company to which it can transfer assets \nand liabilities of the financial company, including swaps and other \nQFCs, in order to preserve the continuity of critical functions of \nthe financial company. The FDIC has indicated that it prefers a \nsingle-point-of-entry strategy, although it retains the ability to \nresolve individual financial companies. On February 17, 2016, the \nFDIC and SEC proposed rules that would clarify the application \nof the Securities Investor Protection Act in a receivership for a \nsystemically significant broker-dealer under the Dodd-Frank Act\xe2\x80\x99s \nOrderly Liquidation Authority. \n\nIn addition, the Dodd-Frank Act and related rules promulgated by \nthe Fed and the FDIC require bank holding companies and com-\npanies treated as bank holding companies with total consolidated \nassets of USD 100 billion or more, such as us, and certain des-\nignated non-bank financial firms, to submit periodically to the Fed \nand the FDIC resolution plans describing the strategy for rapid \nand orderly resolution under the US Bankruptcy Code or other \napplicable insolvency regimes, though such plans may not rely on \nthe Orderly Liquidation Authority. The Fed and FDIC delayed our \n\n42\n\nRegulation and supervision\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\ndeadline for submission of our next US resolution plan until July \n2020.\n\nCybersecurity\nFederal and state regulators, including the DFS, FINRA and \nthe SEC, have increasingly focused on cybersecurity risks and \nresponses for regulated entities. For example, the DFS cyberse-\ncurity regulation applies to any licensed person, including DFS-\nlicensed branches of non-US banks, and requires each company \nto assess its specific risk profile periodically and design a program \nthat addresses its risks in a robust fashion. Each covered entity \nmust monitor its systems and networks and notify the superin-\ntendent of the DFS within 72 hours after it is determined that a \nmaterial cybersecurity event has occurred. Similarly, FINRA has \nidentified cybersecurity as a significant risk and will assess firms\xe2\x80\x99 \nprograms to mitigate those risks. In addition, the SEC has issued \nexpanded interpretative guidance that highlights requirements \nunder US federal securities laws that public operating companies \nmust pay particular attention to with respect to cybersecurity risks \nand incidents.\n\nEU\n\nFinancial services regulation and supervision\nOur EU banks, investment firms and fund managers are subject \nto extensive regulation by EU and national regulatory authorities, \nwhose requirements are increasingly imposed under EU directives \nand regulations aimed at increasing integration and harmonization \nin the European market for financial services. While regulations \nhave immediate and direct effect in EU member states, directives \nmust be implemented through national legislation. As a result, \nthe terms of implementation of directives are not always consis-\ntent from country to country. In response to the financial crisis \nand in order to strengthen European supervisory arrangements, \nthe EU established the European Systemic Risk Board, which \nhas macro-prudential oversight of the financial system. The EU \nhas also established three supervisory authorities responsible for \npromoting greater harmonization and consistent application of EU \nlegislation by national regulators: EBA,\xc2\xa0the European Securities \nand Markets Authority (ESMA) and the European Insurance and \nOccupational Pensions Authority.\n\nThe Basel III capital framework is implemented in the EU by the \nCRD IV and the CRR (together with CRD IV, the CRD IV pack-\nage). The CRD IV package comprises a single prudential rule \nbook for banks and investment firms and establishes corporate \ngovernance and remuneration requirements, including a cap on \nvariable remuneration for EU banks and investment firms. \n\nThe revised Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) \nand MiFIR have introduced a number of significant changes to \nthe regulatory framework established by the Markets in Financial \nInstruments Directive (MiFID I), and the European Commission \nhas adopted a number of delegated and implementing mea-\nsures, which supplement their requirements. In particular, MiFID \nII and MiFIR have introduced enhanced organizational and busi-\nness conduct standards that apply to investment firms, including \na number of Credit Suisse EU entities advising clients within the \nEuropean Economic Area. These provisions include standards \nfor managing conflicts of interest, best execution and enhanced \ninvestor protection. MiFID II has also enforced specific safeguards \nfor algorithmic and high-frequency trading and introduced a ban \non the receipt of investment research by portfolio managers and \nproviders of independent investment advice unless paid for by \nclients.\n\nThe Directive on payment services in the internal market (PSD2), \nthe main piece of legislation governing payment services in the \nEU, came into force on January 12, 2016 and was required to be \ntransposed into their national legislation by the member states by \nJanuary 13, 2018. Among other things, PSD2 extends the geo-\ngraphical scope of transparency and conduct of business require-\nments to payments to and from third countries where one of the \npayment service providers is located in the EU, and to transac-\ntions in non-EU currencies that have at least one leg in the EU. In \naddition, PSD2 has introduced more stringent requirements relat-\ning to operational and security risks. Further delegated legisla-\ntion will apply from September 14, 2019. In order to comply with \nthe new regime, financial institutions, such as Credit Suisse, may \nhave to make changes to their payment services terms and condi-\ntions, as well as to adapt their processes and IT systems.\n\nThe Benchmarks Regulation (BMR) introduces new rules aimed \nat ensuring greater accuracy and integrity of benchmarks in finan-\ncial instruments. The BMR sets out various requirements which \nwill govern the activities of benchmark administrators and sub-\nmitters. The majority of the provisions of the BMR have applied \nsince January 1, 2018. Certain requirements introduced by the \nBMR have applied to Credit Suisse in its capacity as a contribu-\ntor to certain critical benchmarks from June 30, 2016. A number \nof European Commission Delegated Regulations supplement-\ning the BMR entered into force in 2018. The regulations specify, \namong other things, the criteria for assessing whether certain \nevents would result in significant and adverse impacts on matters \nincluding the market integrity and financial stability of one or more \nmember states and the conditions to assess the impact resulting \nfrom the cessation of, or change to, existing benchmarks. \n\nWithin the eurozone, banks are supervised within the Single \nSupervisory Mechanism. This empowers the European Central \nBank (ECB) to act as a single direct supervisor for significant \nbanks in the 17 eurozone countries and for certain non-eurozone \ncountries which may choose to participate in the Single Supervi-\nsory Mechanism.\n\nOn January 4, 2017, the European Commission Delegated \nRegulation supplementing the European Market Infrastructure \nRegulation (also known as \xe2\x80\x9cEMIR\xe2\x80\x9d) with regard to regulatory \ntechnical standards for risk mitigation techniques for OTC deriva-\ntives not cleared by a central counterparty entered into force. \nThe delegated regulation imposes a requirement on financial \n\nRegulation and supervision\n\n43\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\ncounterparties and non-financial counterparties above the clear-\ning threshold to collect initial margin and variation margin in \nrespect of non-centrally cleared OTC derivative transactions. The \nrequirements relating to initial margin and variation margin have \napplied since February 4, 2017 in relation to the largest market \nparticipants. Other market participants have become or in the \nfuture will become subject to the requirements relating to initial \nmargin through a series of annual phase-in dates, starting Sep-\ntember 1, 2017. Requirements relating to variation margin have \napplied to all financial and non-financial counterparties above the \nclearing threshold since March 1, 2017.\n\nResolution regime \nThe BRRD establishes a framework for the recovery and resolu-\ntion of credit institutions and investment firms. The BRRD intro-\nduces requirements for recovery and resolution plans, provides \nfor bank resolution tools, including bail-in for failing banks, and \nestablishes country-specific bank resolution financing arrange-\nments. In addition, as part of their powers over banks in resolu-\ntion, resolution authorities are empowered to replace a bank\xe2\x80\x99s \nsenior management, transfer a bank\xe2\x80\x99s rights, assets and liabilities \nto another person, take a bank into public ownership, and close \nout and terminate a bank\xe2\x80\x99s financial contracts or derivatives con-\ntracts. Banks are required to produce recovery plans, describing \nproposed arrangements to permit them to restore their viability, \nwhile resolution authorities are empowered to produce resolution \nplans which describe how a bank may be resolved in an orderly \nmanner, were it to fail. \n\nUnder the BRRD, the resolution authority can increase the capi-\ntal of a failing or failed bank through bail-in: i.e., the write-down, \nreduction or cancellation of liabilities held by unsecured creditors, or \ntheir conversion to equity or other securities. All of a bank\xe2\x80\x99s liabili-\nties are subject to bail-in, unless explicitly excluded by the BRRD \nbecause they are, for example, covered deposits, secured liabilities, \nor liabilities arising from holding client assets or client money. \n\nThe BRRD also requires banks to hold a certain amount of bail-\ninable loss-absorbing capacity at both individual and consolidated \nlevels. This requirement is known as the MREL, and is conceptu-\nally similar to the TLAC framework. \n\nThe BRRD applies to all Credit Suisse EU entities, including \nbranches of the Bank. The Single Resolution Mechanism Regula-\ntion, which came into force on August 19, 2014, established the \nSingle Resolution Board as the resolution authority in charge of \nBanks in the eurozone. Since January 1, 2016, the Single Reso-\nlution Board has had full resolution powers, including bail-in.\n\nData protection regulation\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is now fully \napplicable and applies to the processing of personal data in the \ncontext of our EU establishments as well as in relation to the pro-\ncessing of personal data of individuals in the EU by our non-EU \nestablishments to the extent such non-EU establishments are \noffering products and/or services to EU customers or monitor-\ning their behavior in the EU. The GDPR requires us to take vari-\nous measures to ensure compliance with the regulation, including \nprocessing personal data in accordance with the data protection \nprinciples, maintaining records of data processing, ensuring ade-\nquate security for personal data, complying with data breach noti-\nfication requirements, and giving effect to data subjects\xe2\x80\x99 rights. \nFurthermore, in accordance with the GDPR, we have appointed \na Data Protection Officer who is responsible for monitoring our \ncompliance with the GDPR and providing advice in connection \nwith the regulation. The GDPR grants broad enforcement powers \nto data protection authorities, including the potential to levy sig-\nnificant administrative fines for non-compliance.\n\nUK\n\nBanking regulation and supervision \nThe principal statutory regulators of financial services activity \nin the UK are the PRA, a part of the Bank of England, which is \nresponsible for the micro-prudential regulation of banks and larger \ninvestment firms, and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), \nwhich regulates markets, the conduct of business of all financial \nfirms, and the prudential regulation of firms not regulated by the \nPRA. In addition, the Financial Policy Committee of the Bank of \nEngland is responsible for macro-prudential regulation. \n\nAs a member state of the EU, the UK is required to implement \nEU directives into national law. The regulatory regime for banks \noperating in the UK conforms to required EU standards, including \ncompliance with capital adequacy standards, customer protection \nrequirements, conduct of business rules and anti-money launder-\ning rules. These standards, requirements and rules are similarly \nimplemented, under the same directives, throughout the other \nmember states of the EU in which we operate. \n\nCSI, Credit Suisse (UK) Limited and Credit Suisse AG, London \nBranch are authorized to take deposits. We also have a number \nof entities authorized to conduct investment business and asset \nmanagement activities. In deciding whether to grant authorization, \nthe PRA must first determine whether a firm satisfies the thresh-\nold conditions for authorization, which include suitability and the \nrequirement for the firm to be fit and proper. \n\n44\n\nRegulation and supervision\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nOur London Branch is required to comply principally with Swiss \nhome country regulation. However, as a response to the global \nfinancial crisis, the PRA made changes to its prudential supervi-\nsion rules in its Handbook of Rules and Guidance, applying a \nprinciple of \xe2\x80\x9cself-sufficiency\xe2\x80\x9d, such that CSI, CSSEL and Credit \nSuisse (UK) Limited are required to maintain adequate liquidity \nresources, under the day-to-day supervision of the entity\xe2\x80\x99s senior \nmanagement, held in a custodian account in the name of the \nentity, unencumbered and attributed to the entity balance sheet. \nIn addition, the PRA requires CSI, CSSEL and Credit Suisse \n(UK) Limited to maintain a minimum capital ratio and to monitor \nand report large exposures in accordance with the rules imple-\nmenting CRD IV.\n\nWith effect from January 1, 2014, CRD IV replaced the previ-\nous CRD with new measures implementing Basel III and other \nrequirements. The PRA is also responsible for approval of certain \nmodels with respect to regulatory capital requirements of our UK \nsubsidiaries. \n\nThe PRA has implemented the requirements of CRD IV relating \nto staff remuneration and imposed a 1:1 cap on variable remuner-\nation which can rise to 1:2 with explicit shareholder approval.\n\nThe UK Financial Services Act 2013 (Banking Reform Act), \nenacted in December 2013, establishes a more stringent regu-\nlatory regime for senior managers and specified risk takers in a \nbank or PRA authorized investment firm; it also makes reckless \nmisconduct in the management of a bank a criminal offense. \nThese rules impact our UK entities, such as CSI and CSSEL.\n\nBroker-dealer and asset management regulation and \nsupervision\nOur London bank and broker-dealer subsidiaries are authorized \nunder the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA) and \nare subject to regulation by the PRA and FCA. In addition, our \nasset management companies are authorized under the FSMA \nand are subject to regulation by the FCA. In deciding whether to \nauthorize an investment firm in the UK, the PRA and FCA will \nconsider the threshold conditions, which include suitability and the \ngeneral requirement for a firm to be fit and proper. The PRA and \nFCA are responsible for regulating most aspects of an investment \nfirm\xe2\x80\x99s business, including its regulatory capital, sales and trading \npractices, use and safekeeping of customer funds and securi-\nties, record-keeping, margin practices and procedures, registra-\ntion standards for individuals carrying on certain functions, anti-\nmoney laundering systems and periodic reporting and settlement \nprocedures.\n\nResolution regime \nThe UK legislation related to the recovery and resolution of credit \ninstitutions such as Credit Suisse consists of the special resolu-\ntion regime (SRR), the PRA recovery and resolution framework \nand the FCA recovery and resolution requirements, which imple-\nment the BRRD in the UK. The UK Banking Act and the related \nsecondary legislation govern the application of the SRR, which \ngrants the UK authorities powers to handle systemically impor-\ntant firms, such as banks, in case of highly likely failure. The UK \nresolution authority is the Bank of England which is empowered, \namong other things, to direct firms and their parent undertakings \nto address or remove barriers to resolvability, to enforce resolu-\ntion actions and to carry out resolvability assessments of credit \ninstitutions.

We seek to main-\ntain available liquidity to meet our obligations in a stressed liquidity \nenvironment.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cLiquidity and funding management\xe2\x80\x9d in III \xe2\x80\x93 Treasury, Risk, Balance \n\nsheet and Off-balance sheet for information on our liquidity management.\n\nOur liquidity could be impaired if we were unable to \naccess the capital markets, sell our assets, our liquidity \ncosts increase or as a result of uncertainties regarding the \npossible discontinuation of benchmark rates\nOur ability to borrow on a secured or unsecured basis and the \ncost of doing so can be affected by increases in interest rates \nor credit spreads, the availability of credit, regulatory require-\nments relating to liquidity or the market perceptions of risk relat-\ning to us, certain of our counterparties or the banking sector as \na whole, including our perceived or actual creditworthiness. An \ninability to obtain financing in the unsecured long-term or short-\nterm debt capital markets, or to access the secured lending \nmarkets, could have a substantial adverse effect on our liquidity. \nIn challenging credit markets our funding costs may increase or \nwe may be unable to raise funds to support or expand our busi-\nnesses, adversely affecting our results of operations. Follow-\ning the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009, our costs of liquidity \nhave been significant and we expect to incur ongoing costs as a \nresult of regulatory requirements for increased liquidity. In addi-\ntion, in July 2017, the FCA, which regulates the London interbank \noffered rate (LIBOR), announced that the FCA will no longer per-\nsuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the \nLIBOR benchmark after 2021. As such, it appears highly likely \nthat LIBOR will be discontinued after 2021. Any such develop-\nments or future changes in the administration of benchmarks \ncould result in adverse consequences to the return on, value of \nand market for securities and other instruments whose returns or \ncontractual mechanics are linked to any such benchmark, includ-\ning those issued by the Group. For example, alternative reference \nrates may not provide a term structure and may require a change \nin contractual terms of products currently indexed on terms other \nthan overnight. The replacement of LIBOR or any other bench-\nmark with an alternative reference rate could negatively impact \nthe value of and return on existing securities and other contracts \nand result in mispricing and additional legal, financial, operational, \ncompliance, reputational or other risks to us, our clients and other \nmarket participants. In addition, any transition to alternative refer-\nence rates will require changes to our documentation, methodolo-\ngies, processes, controls, systems and operations, which would \nresult in increased effort and cost.\n\n46\n\nRisk factors\n\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cPotential replacement of interbank offered rates\xe2\x80\x9d in II \xe2\x80\x93 Operating \n\nand financial review \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse \xe2\x80\x93 Other information for further information.\n\nIf we are unable to raise needed funds in the capital markets \n(including through offerings of equity, debt and regulatory capi-\ntal securities), we may need to liquidate unencumbered assets \nto meet our liabilities. In a time of reduced liquidity, we may be \nunable to sell some of our assets, or we may need to sell assets \nat depressed prices, which in either case could adversely affect \nour results of operations and financial condition.\n\nOur businesses rely significantly on our deposit base for \nfunding\nOur businesses benefit from short-term funding sources, includ-\ning primarily demand deposits, inter-bank loans, time deposits \nand cash bonds. Although deposits have been, over time, a stable \nsource of funding, this may not continue. In that case, our liquidity \nposition could be adversely affected and we might be unable to \nmeet deposit withdrawals on demand or at their contractual matu-\nrity, to repay borrowings as they mature or to fund new loans, \ninvestments and businesses.\n\nChanges in our ratings may adversely affect our business \nRatings are assigned by rating agencies. They may lower, indicate \ntheir intention to lower or withdraw their ratings at any time. The \nmajor rating agencies remain focused on the financial services \nindustry, particularly on uncertainties as to whether firms pose \nsystemic risk in a financial or credit crisis, and on such firms\xe2\x80\x99 \npotential vulnerability to market sentiment and confidence, partic-\nularly during periods of severe economic stress. Any downgrades \nin our ratings could increase our borrowing costs, limit our access \nto capital markets, increase our cost of capital and adversely \naffect the ability of our businesses to sell or market their prod-\nucts, engage in business transactions \xe2\x80\x93 particularly financing \nand\xc2\xa0derivatives transactions \xe2\x80\x93 and retain our clients.\n\nMarket risk\n\nWe may incur significant losses on our trading and \ninvestment activities due to market fluctuations and \nvolatility\nAlthough we continued to strive to reduce our balance sheet and \nmade significant progress in implementing our strategy in 2018, \nwe continue to maintain large trading and investment positions \nand hedges in the debt, currency and equity markets, and in \nprivate equity, hedge funds, real estate and other assets. These \npositions could be adversely affected by volatility in financial and \nother markets, that is, the degree to which prices fluctuate over \na particular period in a particular market, regardless of market \n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nlevels. To the extent that we own assets, or have net long posi-\ntions, in any of those markets, a downturn in those markets could \nresult in losses from a decline in the value of our net long posi-\ntions. Conversely, to the extent that we have sold assets that we \ndo not own, or have net short positions, in any of those markets, \nan upturn in those markets could expose us to potentially sig-\nnificant losses as we attempt to cover our net short positions by \nacquiring assets in a rising market. Market fluctuations, down-\nturns and volatility can adversely affect the\xc2\xa0fair value of our posi-\ntions and our results of operations. Adverse market or economic \nconditions or trends have caused, and in the future may cause, a \nsignificant decline in our net revenues and profitability.\n\nOur businesses and organization are subject to the risk \nof loss from adverse market conditions and unfavorable \neconomic, monetary, political, legal, regulatory and other \ndevelopments in the countries in which we operate\nAs a global financial services company, our businesses are mate-\nrially affected by conditions in the financial markets, economic \nconditions generally and other developments in Europe, the US, \nAsia and elsewhere around the world. The recovery from the eco-\nnomic crisis of 2008 and 2009 continues to be sluggish in sev-\neral key developed markets. The European sovereign debt crisis \nas well as US debt levels and the federal budget process have not \nbeen permanently resolved. In addition, commodity price volatil-\nity and concerns about emerging markets have affected financial \nmarkets. Financial market volatility increased significantly during \n2018, and several global financial market indices declined sharply \nin the fourth quarter of 2018. Our financial condition and results \nof operations could be materially adversely affected if these con-\nditions do not improve, or if they stagnate or worsen. Further, \nvarious countries in which we operate or invest have experienced \nsevere economic disruptions particular to that country or region, \nincluding extreme currency fluctuations, high inflation, or low or \nnegative growth, among other negative conditions. Concerns \nabout weaknesses in the economic and fiscal condition of certain \nEuropean countries have continued, especially with regard to how \nsuch weaknesses might affect other economies as well as finan-\ncial institutions (including us) which lent funds to or did business \nwith or in those countries.\n\nContinued concern about European economies, including the \nrefugee crisis and political uncertainty as well as in relation to the \nUK\xe2\x80\x99s withdrawal from the EU, could cause disruptions in market \nconditions in Europe and around the world. UK Prime Minister \nTheresa May initiated the two-year process of negotiations for \nwithdrawal from the EU in March 2017, with an anticipated date \nof withdrawal in 2019 (subject to any transitional arrangements \nthat may be agreed between the EU and the UK). The results of \nthis negotiation and the macroeconomic impact of this decision \nare difficult to predict and are expected to remain uncertain for \na prolonged period. Among the significant global implications of \nthe UK referendum was the increased uncertainty concerning a \npotentially more persistent and widespread imposition by central \nbanks of negative interest rate policies. We cannot accurately \npredict the impact of the UK leaving the EU on Credit Suisse and \nsuch impact may negatively affect our future results of operations \n\nand financial condition. Our legal entities that are organized or \noperate in the UK could face limitations on providing services \nor otherwise conducting business in the EU following the UK\xe2\x80\x99s \nwithdrawal, which may require us, immediately or following any \napplicable transitional period, to implement potentially significant \nchanges to our legal entity structure and locations in which we \nconduct certain operations. \n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cUK-EU relationship\xe2\x80\x9d in Regulation and supervision \xe2\x80\x93 Recent regula-\n\ntory developments and proposals \xe2\x80\x93 UK for further information.\n\nWhile the execution of the program evolving the Group\xe2\x80\x99s legal \nentity structure to meet developing and future regulatory require-\nments has  substantially concluded, there remain a number of \nuncertainties that may affect the feasibility, scope and timing of \nthe intended results relating to the evolution of our legal entity \nstructure. Significant legal and regulatory changes affecting us \nand our operations may require us to make further changes in \nour legal structure. The implementation of these changes has \nrequired, and may further require, significant time and resources \nand has increased, and may potentially further increase, opera-\ntional, capital, funding and tax costs as well as our counterpar-\nties\xe2\x80\x99 credit risk. The environment of political uncertainty in con-\ntinental Europe may also affect our business. The popularity of \nnationalistic sentiments may result in significant shifts in national \npolicy and a decelerated path to further European integration. \nSimilar uncertainties exist regarding the impact of recent and \nproposed changes in US policies on trade, immigration, climate \nchange and foreign relations. Growing global trade tensions, \nincluding between key trading partners such as China, the US \nand the EU, may be disruptive to global economic growth and \nmay also negatively affect our business.\n\nEconomic disruption in other countries, even in countries in which \nwe do not currently conduct business or have operations, could \nadversely affect our businesses and results. Adverse market and \neconomic conditions continue to create a challenging operating \nenvironment for financial services companies. In particular, the \nimpact of interest and currency exchange rates, the risk of geo-\npolitical events, fluctuations in commodity prices and concerns \nabout European stagnation have affected financial markets and \nthe economy. In recent years, the low interest rate environment \nhas adversely affected our net interest income and the value \nof our trading and non-trading fixed income portfolios. Future \nchanges in interest rates, including increasing interest rates or \nchanges in the current negative short-term interest rates in our \nhome market, could adversely affect our businesses and results. \nIn addition, movements in equity markets have affected the value \nof our trading and non-trading equity portfolios, while the histori-\ncal strength of the Swiss franc has adversely affected our reve-\nnues and net income. Further, diverging monetary policies among \nthe major economies in which we operate, in particular among the \nFed, ECB and SNB, may adversely affect our results.\n\nSuch adverse market or economic conditions may reduce the \nnumber and size of investment banking transactions in which \nwe provide underwriting, mergers and acquisitions advice or \nother services and, therefore, may adversely affect our financial \n\nRisk factors\n\n47\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nadvisory and underwriting fees. Such conditions may adversely \naffect the types and volumes of securities trades that we execute \nfor customers and may adversely affect the net revenues we \nreceive from commissions and spreads. In addition, several of \nour businesses engage in transactions with, or trade in obliga-\ntions of, governmental entities, including supranational, national, \nstate, provincial, municipal and local authorities. These activities \ncan expose us to enhanced sovereign, credit-related, operational \nand reputational risks, including the risks that a governmental \nentity may default on or restructure its obligations or may claim \nthat actions taken by government officials were beyond the legal \nauthority of those officials, which could adversely affect our finan-\ncial condition and results of operations.\n\nUnfavorable market and economic conditions have affected our \nbusinesses over the last years, including the low interest rate \nenvironment, continued cautious investor behavior and changes \nin market structure. These negative factors have been reflected \nin lower commissions and fees from our client-flow sales and \ntrading and asset management activities, including commissions \nand fees that are based on the value of our clients\xe2\x80\x99 portfolios. \nInvestment performance that is below that of competitors or \nasset management benchmarks could result in a decline in assets \nunder management and related fees and make it harder to attract \nnew clients. There has been a fundamental shift in client demand \naway from more complex products and significant client delever-\naging, and our results of operations related to private banking and \nasset management activities have been and could continue to be \nadversely affected as long as this continues.\n\nAdverse market or economic conditions have also negatively \naffected our private equity investments and may negatively affect \nthem in the future since, if a private equity investment substan-\ntially declines in value, we may not receive any increased share of \nthe income and gains from such investment (to which we are enti-\ntled in certain cases when the return on such investment exceeds \ncertain threshold returns), may be obligated to return to inves-\ntors previously received excess carried interest payments and \nmay lose our pro rata share of the capital invested. In addition, it \ncould become more difficult to dispose of the investment as even \ninvestments that are performing well may prove difficult to exit.\n\nIn addition to the macroeconomic factors discussed above, other \nevents beyond our control, including terrorist attacks, cyber \nattacks, military conflicts, economic or political sanctions, dis-\nease pandemics, political unrest or natural disasters, could have a \nmaterial adverse effect on economic and market conditions, mar-\nket volatility and financial activity, with a potential related effect on \nour businesses and results.\n\nWe may incur significant losses in the real estate sector\nWe finance and acquire principal positions in a number of real \nestate and real estate-related products, primarily for clients, and \noriginate loans secured by commercial and residential properties. \nAs of December 31, 2018, our real estate loans as reported to \nthe SNB totaled approximately CHF 146 billion. We also securi-\ntize and trade in commercial and residential real estate and real \n\n48\n\nRisk factors\n\nestate-related whole loans, mortgages and other real estate and \ncommercial assets and products, including\xc2\xa0CMBS and\xc2\xa0RMBS. \nOur real estate-related businesses and risk exposures could be \nadversely affected by any downturn in real estate markets, other \nsectors and the economy as a whole. In particular, the risk of \npotential price corrections in the real estate market in certain \nareas of Switzerland could have a material adverse effect on our \nreal estate-related businesses.\n\nHolding large and concentrated positions may expose us \nto large losses\nConcentrations of risk could increase losses, given that we have \nsizeable loans to, and securities holdings in, certain custom-\ners, industries or countries. Decreasing economic growth in any \nsector in which we make significant commitments, for example, \nthrough underwriting, lending or advisory services, could also \nnegatively affect our net revenues.\n\nWe have significant risk concentration in the financial services \nindustry as a result of the large volume of transactions we rou-\ntinely conduct with broker-dealers, banks, funds and other finan-\ncial institutions, and in the ordinary conduct of our business we \nmay be subject to risk concentration with a particular counter-\nparty. We, like other financial institutions, continue to adapt our \npractices and operations in consultation with our regulators to \nbetter address an evolving understanding of our exposure to, and \nmanagement of, systemic risk and risk concentration to finan-\ncial institutions. Regulators continue to focus on these risks, and \nthere are numerous new regulations and government proposals, \nand significant ongoing regulatory uncertainty, about how best \nto address them. There can be no assurance that the changes in \nour industry, operations, practices and regulation will be effective \nin managing this risk.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cRegulation and supervision\xe2\x80\x9d for further information.\n\nRisk concentration may cause us to suffer losses even when eco-\nnomic and market conditions are generally favorable for others in \nour industry. \n\nOur hedging strategies may not prevent losses\nIf any of the variety of instruments and strategies we use to \nhedge our exposure to various types of risk in our businesses is \nnot effective, we may incur losses. We may be unable to pur-\nchase hedges or be only partially hedged, or our hedging strate-\ngies may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all \nmarket environments or against all types of risk.\n\nMarket risk may increase the other risks that we face\nIn addition to the potentially adverse effects on our businesses \ndescribed above, market risk could exacerbate the other risks \nthat we face. For example, if we were to incur substantial trading \nlosses, our need for liquidity could rise sharply while our access \nto liquidity could be impaired. In conjunction with another mar-\nket downturn, our customers and counterparties could also incur \nsubstantial losses of their own, thereby weakening their financial \ncondition and increasing our credit and counterparty risk exposure \nto them.\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nCredit risk\n\nWe may suffer significant losses from our credit exposures\nOur businesses are subject to the fundamental risk that bor-\nrowers and other counterparties will be unable to perform their \nobligations. Our credit exposures exist across a wide range of \ntransactions that we engage in with a large number of clients \nand counterparties, including lending relationships, commitments \nand letters of credit, as well as\xc2\xa0derivative, currency exchange and \nother transactions. Our exposure to credit risk can be exacer-\nbated by adverse economic or market trends, as well as increased \nvolatility in relevant markets or instruments. In addition, disrup-\ntions in the liquidity or transparency of the financial markets may \nresult in our inability to sell, syndicate or realize the value of our \npositions, thereby leading to increased concentrations. Any inabil-\nity to reduce these positions may not only increase the market \nand credit risks associated with such positions, but also increase \nthe level of\xc2\xa0risk-weighted assets on our balance sheet, thereby \nincreasing our capital requirements, all of which could adversely \naffect our businesses.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cCredit risk\xe2\x80\x9d in III \xe2\x80\x93 Treasury, Risk, Balance sheet and Off-balance \n\nsheet \xe2\x80\x93 Risk management \xe2\x80\x93 Risk coverage and management for information on \nmanagement of credit risk.\n\nOur regular review of the creditworthiness of clients and counter-\nparties for credit losses does not depend on the accounting treat-\nment of the asset or commitment. Changes in creditworthiness of \nloans and loan commitments that are fair valued are reflected in \ntrading revenues.\n\nManagement\xe2\x80\x99s determination of the provision for loan losses is \nsubject to significant judgment. Our banking businesses may \nneed to increase their provisions for loan losses or may record \nlosses in excess of the previously determined provisions if our \noriginal estimates of loss prove inadequate, which could have a \nmaterial adverse effect on our results of operations.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cCredit risk\xe2\x80\x9d in III \xe2\x80\x93 Treasury, Risk, Balance sheet and Off-balance \nsheet \xe2\x80\x93 Risk management \xe2\x80\x93 Risk coverage and management and \xe2\x80\x9cNote 1 \n\xe2\x80\x93 Summary of significant accounting policies\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cNote 9 \xe2\x80\x93 Provision for credit \nlosses\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cNote 19 \xe2\x80\x93 Loans, allowance for loan losses and credit quality\xe2\x80\x9d in \nVI \xe2\x80\x93 Consolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group for information \non provisions for loan losses and related risk mitigation.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, we may assume long-term credit \nrisk, extend credit against illiquid collateral and price derivative \ninstruments aggressively based on the credit risks that we take. \nAs a result of these risks, our capital and liquidity requirements \nmay continue to increase.\n\nDefaults by one or more large financial institutions could \nadversely affect financial markets generally and us \nspecifically\nConcerns or even rumors about or a default by one institution \ncould lead to significant liquidity problems, losses or defaults by \nother institutions because the commercial soundness of many \nfinancial institutions may be closely related as a result of credit, \ntrading, clearing or other relationships between institutions. This \nrisk is sometimes referred to as systemic risk. Concerns about \n\ndefaults by and failures of many financial institutions, particularly \nthose in or with significant exposure to the eurozone, continued in \n2018 and could continue to lead to losses or defaults by financial \ninstitutions and financial intermediaries with which we interact on \na daily basis, such as clearing agencies, clearing houses, banks, \nsecurities firms and exchanges. Our credit risk exposure will also \nincrease if the collateral we hold cannot be realized or can only \nbe liquidated at prices insufficient to cover the full amount of \nexposure.\n\nThe information that we use to manage our credit risk may \nbe inaccurate or incomplete\nAlthough we regularly review our credit exposure to specific cli-\nents and counterparties and to specific industries, countries and \nregions that we believe may present credit concerns, default \nrisk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to \nforesee or detect, such as fraud. We may also lack correct and \ncomplete information with respect to the credit or trading risks of \na counterparty or risk associated with specific industries, coun-\ntries and regions or misinterpret such information that is received \nor otherwise incorrectly assess a given risk situation. Additionally, \nthere can be no assurance that measures instituted to manage \nsuch risk will be effective in all instances.\n\nRisks relating to our strategy\n\nWe may not achieve all of the expected benefits of our \nstrategic initiatives \nIn October 2015, we announced a comprehensive new strate-\ngic direction, structure and organization of the Group, which we \nupdated in 2016, 2017 and 2018. Our ability to implement our \nstrategic direction, structure and organization is based on a num-\nber of key assumptions regarding the future economic environ-\nment, the economic growth of certain geographic regions, the \nregulatory landscape, our ability to meet certain financial goals \nand targets, anticipated interest rates and central bank action, \namong other things. If any of these assumptions (including but not \nlimited to our ability to meet certain financial goals and targets) \nprove inaccurate in whole or in part, our ability to achieve some \nor all of the expected benefits of this strategy could be limited, \nincluding our ability to meet our stated financial goals and targets \nand retain key employees. Factors beyond our control, including \nbut not limited to market and economic conditions, changes in \nlaws, rules or regulations, including the application of regulations \nto be issued by the US Internal Revenue Service related to BEAT, \nexecution risk related to the implementation of our strategy and \nother challenges and risk factors discussed in this report, could \nlimit our ability to achieve some or all of the expected benefits of \nthis strategy. If we are unable to implement our strategy success-\nfully in whole or in part or should the components of the strat-\negy that are implemented fail to produce the expected benefits, \nour financial results and our share price may be materially and \nadversely affected.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cStrategy\xe2\x80\x9d for further information on our strategic direction.\n\nRisk factors\n\n49\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nAdditionally, part of our strategy involves a change in focus within \ncertain areas of our business, which may have unanticipated neg-\native effects in other areas of the business and may result in an \nadverse effect on our business as a whole.\n\nThe implementation of our strategy may increase our exposure \nto certain risks, including but not limited to credit risks, mar-\nket risks, operational risks and regulatory risks. We also seek to \nachieve certain financial goals and targets, for example in relation \nto return on tangible equity, which may or may not be successful. \nThere is no guarantee that we will be able to achieve these goals \nand targets in the form described or at all. Finally, changes to the \norganizational structure of our business, as well as changes in \npersonnel and management, may lead to temporary instability of \nour operations.\n\nawards, modeling our risk exposure and calculating expenses and \nliabilities associated with our pension plans. These estimates are \nbased upon judgment and available information, and our actual \nresults may differ materially from these estimates.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cCritical accounting estimates\xe2\x80\x9d in II \xe2\x80\x93 Operating and financial review \n\nand \xe2\x80\x9cNote 1 \xe2\x80\x93 Summary of significant accounting policies\xe2\x80\x9d in VI \xe2\x80\x93 Consolidated \nfinancial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group for information on these estimates \nand valuations.\n\nOur estimates and valuations rely on models and processes to \npredict economic conditions and market or other events that \nmight affect the ability of counterparties to perform their obliga-\ntions to us or impact the value of assets. To the extent our models \nand processes become less predictive due to unforeseen market \nconditions, illiquidity or volatility, our ability to make accurate esti-\nmates and valuations could be adversely affected.\n\nIn addition, acquisitions and other similar transactions we under-\ntake  subject us to certain risks. Even though we review the \nrecords of companies we plan to acquire, it is generally not fea-\nsible for us to review all such records in detail. Even an in-depth \nreview of records may not reveal existing or potential problems or \npermit us to become familiar enough with a business to assess \nfully its capabilities and deficiencies. As a result, we may assume \nunanticipated liabilities (including legal and compliance issues), or \nan acquired business may not perform as well as expected. We \nalso face the risk that we will not be able to integrate acquisitions \ninto our existing operations effectively as a result of, among other \nthings, differing procedures, business practices and technology \nsystems, as well as difficulties in adapting an acquired company \ninto our organizational structure. We face the risk that the returns \non acquisitions will not support the expenditures or indebtedness \nincurred to acquire such businesses or the capital expenditures \nneeded to develop such businesses. We also face the risk that \nunsuccessful acquisitions will ultimately result in our having to \nwrite down or write off any goodwill associated with such transac-\ntions. We continue to have a significant amount of goodwill relat-\ning to our acquisition of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. and \nother transactions recorded on our balance sheet that could result \nin additional goodwill impairment charges.\n\nWe may also seek to engage in new joint ventures (within the \nGroup and with external parties) and strategic alliances. Although \nwe endeavor to identify appropriate partners, our joint venture \nefforts may prove unsuccessful or may not justify our investment \nand other commitments.\n\nRisks from estimates and \nvaluations\nWe make estimates and valuations that affect our reported \nresults, including measuring the\xc2\xa0fair value of certain assets and \nliabilities, establishing provisions for contingencies and losses \nfor loans, litigation and regulatory proceedings, accounting for \ngoodwill and intangible asset impairments, evaluating our ability \nto realize deferred tax assets, valuing equity-based compensation \n\nRisks relating to off-balance \nsheet entities\nWe enter into transactions with special purpose entities (SPEs) in \nour normal course of business, and certain SPEs with which we \ntransact business are not consolidated and their assets and liabili-\nties are off-balance sheet. We may have to exercise significant \nmanagement judgment in applying relevant accounting consoli-\ndation standards, either initially or after the occurrence of certain \nevents that may require us to reassess whether consolidation is \nrequired. Accounting standards relating to consolidation, and their \ninterpretation, have changed and may continue to change. If we \nare required to consolidate an SPE, its assets and liabilities would \nbe recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and we would \nrecognize related gains and losses in our consolidated statements \nof operations, and this could have an adverse impact on our \nresults of operations and capital and leverage ratios.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cOff-balance sheet\xe2\x80\x9d in III \xe2\x80\x93 Treasury, Risk, Balance sheet and Off-\nbalance sheet \xe2\x80\x93 Balance sheet and off-balance sheet for information on our \ntransactions with and commitments to SPEs. \n\nCountry and currency exchange \nrisk \n\nCountry risks may increase market and credit risks we \nface\nCountry, regional and political risks are components of market \nand credit risk. Financial markets and economic conditions gen-\nerally have been and may in the future be materially affected by \nsuch risks. Economic or political pressures in a country or region, \nincluding those arising from local market disruptions, currency cri-\nses, monetary controls or other factors, may adversely affect the \nability of clients or counterparties located in that country or region \nto obtain foreign currency or credit and, therefore, to perform \ntheir obligations to us, which in turn may have an adverse impact \non our results of operations.  \n\n50\n\nRisk factors\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nWe may face significant losses in emerging markets\nAn element of our strategy is to scale up our private banking busi-\nnesses in emerging market countries. Our implementation of that \nstrategy will necessarily increase our existing exposure to eco-\nnomic instability in those countries. We monitor these risks, seek \ndiversity in the sectors in which we invest and emphasize client-\ndriven business. Our efforts at limiting emerging market risk, \nhowever, may not always succeed. In addition, various emerging \nmarket countries, such as Brazil during 2017 and 2018, have \nexperienced and may continue to experience severe economic, \nfinancial and political disruptions  or slower economic growth than \nin prior years. In addition, sanctions have been imposed on cer-\ntain individuals and companies in Russia and further sanctions are \npossible. The possible effects of any such disruptions may include \nan adverse impact on our businesses and increased volatility in \nfinancial markets generally.\n\nCurrency fluctuations may adversely affect our results of \noperations\nWe are exposed to risk from fluctuations in exchange rates for \ncurrencies, particularly the US dollar. In particular, a substantial \nportion of our assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies \nother than the Swiss franc, which is the primary currency of our \nfinancial reporting. Our capital is also stated in Swiss francs, and \nwe do not fully hedge our capital position against changes in cur-\nrency exchange rates. The Swiss franc weakened slightly  against \nthe US dollar and strengthened against the euro in 2018.\n\nAs we incur a significant part of our expenses in Swiss francs \nwhile we generate a large proportion of our revenues in other cur-\nrencies, our earnings are sensitive to changes in the exchange \nrates between the Swiss franc and other major currencies. \nAlthough we have implemented a number of measures designed \nto offset the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our results \nof operations, the appreciation of the Swiss franc in particular and \nexchange rate volatility in general have had an adverse impact on \nour results of operations and capital position in recent years and \nmay have such an effect in the future.\n\nOperational risk\n\nWe are exposed to a wide variety of operational risks, \nincluding cybersecurity and other information technology \nrisks\nOperational risk is the risk of financial loss arising from inad-\nequate or failed internal processes, people or systems or from \nexternal events. In general, although we have business conti-\nnuity plans, our businesses face a wide variety of operational \nrisks, including technology risk that stems from dependencies on \ninformation technology, third-party suppliers and the telecom-\nmunications infrastructure as well as from the interconnectivity of \nmultiple financial institutions with central agents, exchanges and \nclearing houses. As a global financial services company, we rely \nheavily on our financial, accounting and other data processing \nsystems, which are varied and complex. Our business depends \non our ability to process a large volume of diverse and complex \n\ntransactions, including\xc2\xa0derivatives transactions, which have \nincreased in volume and complexity. We are exposed to opera-\ntional risk arising from errors made in the execution, confirma-\ntion or settlement of transactions or from transactions not being \nproperly recorded or accounted for. Cybersecurity and other infor-\nmation technology risks for financial institutions have significantly \nincreased in recent years. Regulatory requirements in these areas \nhave increased and are expected to increase further.\n\nInformation security, data confidentiality and integrity are of criti-\ncal importance to our businesses. Despite our wide array of \nsecurity measures to protect the confidentiality, integrity and \navailability of our systems and information, it is not always pos-\nsible to anticipate the evolving threat landscape and mitigate all \nrisks to our systems and information. We could also be affected \nby risks to the systems and information of clients, vendors, ser-\nvice providers, counterparties and other third parties. In addition, \nwe may introduce new products or services or change processes, \nresulting in new operational risk that we may not fully appreciate \nor identify.\n\nThese threats may derive from human error, fraud or malice, or \nmay result from accidental technological failure. There may also \nbe attempts to fraudulently induce employees, clients, third par-\nties or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information \nin order to gain access to our data or that of our clients.\n\nA cyber attack, information or security breach or technology \nfailure may result in operational issues, the infiltration of pay-\nment systems or the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, \nmisuse, loss or destruction of confidential, proprietary and other \ninformation relating to Credit Suisse, our clients, vendors, service \nproviders, counterparties or other third parties. Given our global \nfootprint and the high volume of transactions we process, the \nlarge number of clients, partners and counterparties with which \nwe do business, our growing use of digital, mobile and internet-\nbased services, and the increasing frequency, sophistication and \nevolving nature of cyber attacks, a cyber attack, information or \nsecurity breach or technology failure may occur without detection \nfor an extended period of time. In addition, we expect that any \ninvestigation of a cyber attack, information or security breach or \ntechnology failure will be inherently unpredictable and it may take \ntime before any investigation is complete. During such time, we \nmay not know the extent of the harm or how best to remediate \nit and certain errors or actions may be repeated or compounded \nbefore they are discovered and rectified, all or any of which would \nfurther increase the costs and consequences of a cyber attack, \ninformation or security breach or technology failure.\n\nIf any of our systems do not operate properly or are compromised \nas a result of cyber attacks, information or security breaches, \ntechnology failures, unauthorized access, loss or destruction of \ndata, unavailability of service, computer viruses or other events \nthat could have an adverse security impact, we could be subject \nto litigation or suffer financial loss not covered by insurance, a dis-\nruption of our businesses, liability to our clients, damage to rela-\ntionships with our vendors, regulatory intervention or reputational \n\nRisk factors\n\n51\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\ndamage. Any such event could also require us to expend signifi-\ncant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to \ninvestigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures. We \nmay also be required to expend resources to comply with new \nand increasingly expansive regulatory requirements related to \ncybersecurity.\n\nWe may suffer losses due to employee misconduct\nOur businesses are exposed to risk from potential non-compli-\nance with policies or regulations, employee misconduct or negli-\ngence and fraud, which could result in civil or criminal investiga-\ntions and charges, regulatory sanctions and serious reputational \nor financial harm. In recent years, a number of multinational finan-\ncial institutions have suffered material losses due to, for example, \nthe actions of traders performing unauthorized trades or other \nemployee misconduct. It is not always possible to deter employee \nmisconduct and the precautions we take to prevent and detect \nthis activity may not always be effective.\n\nRisk management\n\nWe have risk management procedures and policies designed to \nmanage our risk. These techniques and policies, however, may \nnot always be effective, particularly in highly volatile markets. We \ncontinue to adapt our risk management techniques, in particu-\nlar\xc2\xa0value-at-risk and economic capital, which rely on historical \ndata, to reflect changes in the financial and credit markets. No \nrisk management procedures can anticipate every market devel-\nopment or event, and our risk management procedures and hedg-\ning strategies, and the judgments behind them, may not fully miti-\ngate our risk exposure in all markets or against all types of risk.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cRisk management\xe2\x80\x9d in III \xe2\x80\x93 Treasury, Risk, Balance sheet and Off-\n\nbalance sheet for information on our risk management.\n\nLegal and regulatory risks \n\nOur exposure to legal liability is significant\nWe face significant legal risks in our businesses, and the volume \nand amount of damages claimed in litigation, regulatory proceed-\nings and other adversarial proceedings against financial services \nfirms continue to increase in many of the principal markets in \nwhich we operate.\n\nWe and our subsidiaries are subject to a number of material \nlegal proceedings, regulatory actions and investigations, and an \nadverse result in one or more of these proceedings could have a \nmaterial adverse effect on our operating results for any particular \nperiod, depending, in part, upon our results for such period.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cNote 39 \xe2\x80\x93 Litigation\xe2\x80\x9d in VI \xe2\x80\x93 Consolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 \n\nCredit Suisse Group for information relating to these and other legal and regu-\nlatory proceedings involving our investment banking and other businesses.\n\nIt is inherently difficult to predict the outcome of many of the \nlegal, regulatory and other adversarial proceedings involving our \nbusinesses, particularly those cases in which the matters are \nbrought on behalf of various classes of claimants, seek damages \n\n52\n\nRisk factors\n\nof unspecified or indeterminate amounts or involve novel legal \nclaims. Management is required to establish, increase or release \nreserves for losses that are probable and reasonably estimable \nin connection with these matters, all of which requires significant \njudgment.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cCritical accounting estimates\xe2\x80\x9d in II \xe2\x80\x93 Operating and financial review \n\nand \xe2\x80\x9cNote 1 \xe2\x80\x93 Summary of significant accounting policies\xe2\x80\x9d in VI \xe2\x80\x93 Consolidated \nfinancial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group for more information.\n\nRegulatory changes may adversely affect our business and \nability to execute our strategic plans\nAs a participant in the financial services industry, we are subject \nto extensive regulation by governmental agencies, supervisory \nauthorities and self-regulatory organizations in Switzerland, the \nEU, the UK, the US and other jurisdictions in which we operate \naround the world. Such regulation is increasingly more extensive \nand complex and, in recent years, costs related to our compliance \nwith these requirements and the penalties and fines sought and \nimposed on the financial services industry by regulatory authori-\nties have all increased significantly and may increase further. \nMoreover, a number of these requirements are currently being \nfinalized and their regulatory burden may further increase in the \nfuture. For example, the Basel III reforms are still being final-\nized and implemented and/or phased-in, as applicable, and new \ngone concern requirements may be introduced for Credit Suisse \nAG. These regulations often serve to limit our activities, including \nthrough the application of increased or enhanced capital, lever-\nage and liquidity requirements, the addition of capital surcharges \nfor risks related to operational, litigation, regulatory and similar \nmatters, customer protection and market conduct regulations and \ndirect or indirect restrictions on the businesses in which we may \noperate or invest. Such limitations can have a negative effect on \nour business and our ability to implement strategic initiatives. To \nthe extent we are required to divest certain businesses, we could \nincur losses, as we may be forced to sell such businesses at a \ndiscount, which in certain instances could be substantial, as a \nresult of both the constrained timing of such sales and the pos-\nsibility that other financial institutions are liquidating similar invest-\nments at the same time.\n\nSince 2008, regulators and governments have focused on the \nreform of the financial services industry, including enhanced capi-\ntal, leverage and liquidity requirements, changes in compensation \npractices (including tax levies) and measures to address systemic \nrisk, including ring-fencing certain activities and operations within \nspecific legal entities. We are already subject to extensive regula-\ntion in many areas of our business and expect to face increased \nregulation and regulatory scrutiny and enforcement. These vari-\nous regulations and requirements could require us to reduce \nassets held in certain subsidiaries or inject capital or other funds \ninto or otherwise change our operations or the structure of our \nsubsidiaries and the Group. We expect such increased regula-\ntion to continue to increase our costs, including, but not limited \nto, costs related to compliance, systems and operations, as well \nas affect our ability to conduct certain types of business, which \ncould adversely affect our profitability and competitive position. \nVariations in the details and implementation of such regulations \n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nmay further negatively affect us, as certain requirements currently \nare not expected to apply equally to all of our competitors or to be \nimplemented uniformly across jurisdictions.\n\nFor example, the additional requirements related to minimum \nregulatory capital, leverage ratios and liquidity measures imposed \nby\xc2\xa0Basel III, as implemented in Switzerland, together with more \nstringent requirements imposed by the Swiss\xc2\xa0legislation, and the \nrelated implementing ordinances and actions by our regulators, \nhave contributed to our decision to reduce risk-weighted assets \nand the size of our balance sheet, and could potentially impact \nour access to capital markets and increase our funding costs. In \naddition, the ongoing implementation in the US of the provisions \nof the Dodd-Frank Act, including the \xe2\x80\x9cVolcker Rule\xe2\x80\x9d, deriva-\ntives regulation, and other regulatory developments described \nin \xe2\x80\x9cRegulation and supervision\xe2\x80\x9d, have imposed, and will continue \nto impose, new regulatory burdens on certain of our operations. \nThese requirements have contributed to our decision to exit cer-\ntain businesses (including a number of our private equity busi-\nnesses) and may lead us to exit other businesses. Recent CFTC, \nSEC and Fed rules and proposals have materially increased, or \ncould in the future materially increase, the operating costs, includ-\ning margin requirements, compliance, information technology \nand related costs, associated with our derivatives businesses \nwith US persons, while at the same time making it more difficult \nfor us to transact derivatives business outside the US. Further, \nin 2014, the Fed adopted a final rule under the Dodd-Frank Act \nthat created a new framework for regulation of the US operations \nof foreign banking organizations such as ours. Certain aspects \nof the framework are still to be implemented. Implementation is \nexpected to continue to result in our incurring additional costs and \nto affect the way we conduct our business in the US, including \nthrough our US IHC. Certain of these proposals are not final or \nmay be subject to further modification or changes, and the ulti-\nmate impact of any final requirements cannot be predicted at this \ntime. Further, already enacted and possible future cross-border \ntax regulation with extraterritorial effect, such as FATCA, and \nother bilateral or multilateral tax treaties and agreements on the \nautomatic exchange of information in tax matters, impose detailed \nreporting obligations and increased compliance and systems-\nrelated costs on our businesses. In addition, the US tax reform \nenacted on December 22, 2017 introduced substantial changes \nto the US tax system, including the lowering of the corporate \ntax rate and the introduction of BEAT. Additionally, implementa-\ntion of CRD IV, MiFID II and MiFIR and their Swiss counterpart, \nthe Federal Financial Services Act (FFSA), and other reforms \nmay negatively affect our business activities. Whether or not the \nFFSA, together with supporting or implementing laws and regula-\ntions, will be deemed equivalent to MiFID II is uncertain. Swiss \nbanks, including us, may accordingly be limited from participat-\ning in businesses regulated by such laws. Finally, we expect \nthat TLAC requirements, which took effect on January 1, 2019 \nin Switzerland and the US, as well as in the UK, and are being \nfinalized in many other jurisdictions, including the EU, as well \nas new requirements and rules with respect to the internal total \n\nloss-absorbing capacity of G-SIBs and their operating entities \n(iTLAC), may increase our cost of funding and restrict our ability \nto deploy capital and liquidity on a global basis as needed when \nthey are implemented.\n\nFurther, following the formal notification by the UK of its deci-\nsion to leave the EU, negotiations have been carried out on the \nwithdrawal agreement and the final outcome remains uncertain. \nNegotiations include the renegotiation, either during a transitional \nperiod or more permanently, of a number of regulatory and other \narrangements between the EU and the UK that could directly \nimpact our business. Adverse changes to any of these arrange-\nments, and even uncertainty over potential changes during the \nremaining period of negotiation, could potentially impact our \nresults.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cUK-EU relationship\xe2\x80\x9d in Regulation and supervision \xe2\x80\x93 Recent regula-\n\ntory developments and proposals \xe2\x80\x93 UK for further information.\n\nIn addition, there have been frequent and complex changes in \nsanction regimes imposed on countries, entities and individuals \nin recent years. As a result, our costs of monitoring and comply-\ning with sanctions requirements have increased, and there is an \nincreased risk that we will not timely identify prohibited activity.\n\nWe expect the financial services industry and its members, \nincluding us, to continue to be affected by the significant uncer-\ntainty over the scope and content of regulatory reform in 2019 \nand beyond. The uncertainty about the future US regulatory \nagenda, which includes a variety of proposals to change existing \nregulations or the approach to regulation of the financial industry \nand potential changes in regulation following a UK withdrawal \nfrom the EU and the results of national elections in Europe may \nresult in significant changes in the regulatory direction and poli-\ncies applicable to us. Changes in laws, rules or regulations, or \nin their interpretation or enforcement, or the implementation of \nnew laws, rules or regulations, may adversely affect our results of \noperations.\n\nDespite our best efforts to comply with applicable regulations, \na number of risks remain, particularly in areas where applicable \nregulations may be unclear or inconsistent among jurisdictions or \nwhere regulators or international bodies, organizations or unions \nrevise their previous guidance or courts overturn previous rul-\nings. Additionally, authorities in many jurisdictions have the power \nto bring administrative or judicial proceedings against us, which \ncould result in, among other things, suspension or revocation of \nour licenses, cease and desist orders, fines, civil penalties, crimi-\nnal penalties or other disciplinary action which could materially \nadversely affect our results of operations and seriously harm our \nreputation.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cRegulation and supervision\xe2\x80\x9d for a description of our regulatory regime \nand a summary of some of the significant regulatory and government reform \nproposals affecting the financial services industry as well as to \xe2\x80\x9cLiquidity and \nfunding management\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cCapital management\xe2\x80\x9d in III \xe2\x80\x93 Treasury, Risk, Balance \nsheet and Off-balance sheet for information regarding our current regulatory \nframework and expected changes to this framework affecting capital and liquid-\nity standards.\n\nRisk factors\n\n53\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nSwiss resolution proceedings and resolution planning \nrequirements may affect our shareholders and creditors\nPursuant to Swiss banking laws, FINMA has broad powers and \ndiscretion in the case of resolution proceedings with respect to a \nSwiss bank, such as Credit Suisse AG or Credit Suisse (Schweiz) \nAG, and to a Swiss parent company of a financial group, such \nas Credit Suisse Group AG. These broad powers include the \npower to open restructuring proceedings with respect to Credit \nSuisse AG, Credit Suisse (Schweiz) AG or Credit Suisse Group \nAG and, in connection therewith, cancel the outstanding equity \nof the entity subject to such proceedings, convert such entity\xe2\x80\x99s \ndebt instruments and other liabilities into equity and/or cancel \nsuch debt instruments and other liabilities, in each case, in whole \nor in part, and stay (for a maximum of two business days) certain \nrights under contracts to which such entity is a party, as well as \nthe power to order protective measures, including the deferment \nof payments, and institute liquidation proceedings with respect to \nCredit Suisse AG, Credit Suisse (Schweiz) AG or Credit Suisse \nGroup AG. The scope of such powers and discretion and the \nlegal mechanisms that would be utilized are subject to develop-\nment and interpretation.\n\nWe are currently subject to resolution planning requirements in \nSwitzerland, the US and the UK and may face similar require-\nments in other jurisdictions. If a resolution plan is determined by \nthe relevant authority to be inadequate, relevant regulations may \nallow the authority to place limitations on the scope or size of our \nbusiness in that jurisdiction, require us to hold higher amounts of \ncapital or liquidity, require us to divest assets or subsidiaries or \nto change our legal structure or business to remove the relevant \nimpediments to resolution.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cRecent regulatory developments and proposals \xe2\x80\x93 Switzerland\xe2\x80\x9d and \n\xe2\x80\x9cRegulatory framework \xe2\x80\x93 Switzerland \xe2\x80\x93 Resolution regime\xe2\x80\x9d in Regulation and \nsupervision for a description of the current resolution regime under Swiss \nbanking laws as it applies to Credit Suisse AG, Credit Suisse (Schweiz) AG and \nCredit Suisse Group AG.\n\nAny conversion of our convertible capital instruments \nwould dilute the ownership interests of existing \nshareholders\nUnder Swiss regulatory capital rules, we are required to issue a \nsignificant amount of contingent capital instruments, certain of \nwhich would convert into common equity upon the occurrence of \nspecified triggering events, including our CET1 ratio falling below \nprescribed thresholds (7% in the case of high-trigger instru-\nments), or a determination by FINMA that conversion is neces-\nsary, or that we require extraordinary public sector capital sup-\nport, to prevent us from becoming insolvent. As of December 31, \n2018, we had 2,550.6 million common shares outstanding and \nwe had issued in the aggregate an equivalent of CHF\xc2\xa01.5 billion \nin principal amount of such contingent convertible capital instru-\nments, and we may issue more such contingent convertible capi-\ntal instruments in the future. The conversion of some or all of our \ncontingent convertible capital instruments due to the occurrence \nof any of such triggering events would result in the dilution of \n\nthe ownership interests of our then existing shareholders, which \ndilution could be substantial. Additionally, any conversion, or the \nanticipation of the possibility of a conversion, could depress the \nmarket price of our ordinary shares.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cContingent convertible capital instruments\xe2\x80\x9d in III \xe2\x80\x93 Treasury, Risk, \n\nBalance sheet and Off-balance sheet \xe2\x80\x93 Capital management \xe2\x80\x93 Capital instru-\nments for more information on the triggering events related to our contingent \nconvertible capital instruments. \n\nChanges in monetary policy are beyond our control and \ndifficult to predict\nWe are affected by the monetary policies adopted by the cen-\ntral banks and regulatory authorities of Switzerland, the US and \nother countries. The actions of the SNB and other central bank-\ning authorities directly impact our cost of funds for lending, capi-\ntal raising and investment activities and may impact the value of \nfinancial instruments we hold and the competitive and operat-\ning environment for the financial services industry. Many central \nbanks, including the Fed, have implemented significant changes \nto their monetary policy or have experienced significant changes \nin their management and may implement or experience further \nchanges. We cannot predict whether these changes will have \na material adverse effect on us or our operations. In addition, \nchanges in monetary policy may affect the credit quality of our \ncustomers. Any changes in monetary policy are beyond our con-\ntrol and difficult to predict.\n\nLegal restrictions on our clients may reduce the demand \nfor our services\nWe may be materially affected not only by regulations applicable \nto us as a financial services company, but also by regulations and \nchanges in enforcement practices applicable to our clients. Our \nbusiness could be affected by, among other things, existing and \nproposed tax legislation, antitrust and competition policies, cor-\nporate governance initiatives and other governmental regulations \nand policies, and changes in the interpretation or enforcement \nof existing laws and rules that affect business and the financial \nmarkets. For example, focus on tax compliance and changes in \nenforcement practices could lead to further asset outflows from \nour private banking businesses.\n\nCompetition \n\nWe face intense competition\nWe face intense competition in all financial services markets and \nfor the products and services we offer. Consolidation through \nmergers, acquisitions, alliances and cooperation, including as a \nresult of financial distress, has increased competitive pressures. \nCompetition is based on many factors, including the products and \nservices offered, pricing, distribution systems, customer service, \nbrand recognition, perceived financial strength and the willingness \nto use capital to serve client needs. Consolidation has created \na number of firms that, like us, have the ability to offer a wide \nrange of products, from loans and deposit-taking to brokerage, \n\n54\n\nRisk factors\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\ninvestment banking and asset management services. Some of \nthese firms may be able to offer a broader range of products than \nwe do, or offer such products at more competitive prices. Cur-\nrent market conditions have resulted in significant changes in the \ncompetitive landscape in our industry as many institutions have \nmerged, altered the scope of their business, declared bankruptcy, \nreceived government assistance or changed their regulatory sta-\ntus, which will affect how they conduct their business. In addition, \ncurrent market conditions have had a fundamental impact on cli-\nent demand for products and services. Some new competitors \nin the financial technology sector have sought to target existing \nsegments of our businesses that could be susceptible to disrup-\ntion by innovative or less regulated business models. Emerging \ntechnology may also result in further competition in the markets in \nwhich we operate. We can give no assurance that our results of \noperations will not be adversely affected.\n\nOur competitive position could be harmed if our reputation \nis damaged\nIn the highly competitive environment arising from globalization \nand convergence in the financial services industry, a reputation \nfor financial strength and integrity is critical to our performance, \nincluding our ability to attract and retain clients and employees. \nOur reputation could be harmed if our comprehensive procedures \nand controls fail, or appear to fail, to address conflicts of interest, \nprevent employee misconduct, produce materially accurate and \ncomplete financial and other information or prevent adverse legal \nor regulatory actions.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cReputational risk\xe2\x80\x9d in III \xe2\x80\x93 Treasury, Risk, Balance sheet and Off-\n\nbalance sheet \xe2\x80\x93 Risk management \xe2\x80\x93 Risk coverage and management for more \ninformation.\n\nWe must recruit and retain highly skilled employees\nOur performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts \nof highly skilled individuals. Competition for qualified employees \nis intense. We have devoted considerable resources to recruit-\ning, training and compensating employees. Our continued ability \nto compete effectively in our businesses depends on our ability \nto attract new employees and to retain and motivate our exist-\ning employees. The continued public focus on compensation \npractices in the financial services industry, and related regulatory \nchanges, may have an adverse impact on our ability to attract and \nretain highly skilled employees. In particular, limits on the amount \nand form of executive compensation imposed by regulatory initia-\ntives, including the Swiss Ordinance Against Excessive Compen-\nsation with respect to Listed Stock Corporations (Compensation \nOrdinance) in Switzerland and the implementation of CRD IV in \nthe UK, could potentially have an adverse impact on our ability to \nretain certain of our most highly skilled employees and hire new \nqualified employees in certain businesses.\n\nWe face competition from new trading technologies\nOur businesses face competitive challenges from new trading \ntechnologies, including trends towards direct access to auto-\nmated and electronic markets, and the move to more automated \ntrading platforms. Such technologies and trends may adversely \naffect our commission and trading revenues, exclude our busi-\nnesses from certain transaction flows, reduce our participation in \nthe trading markets and the associated access to market informa-\ntion and lead to the creation of new and stronger competitors. We \nhave made, and may continue to be required to make, significant \nadditional expenditures to develop and support new trading sys-\ntems or otherwise invest in technology to maintain our competitive \nposition.\n\nRisk factors\n\n55\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\n[this page intentionally left\xc2\xa0blank]\n\n56\n\nRisk factors\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nII \xe2\x80\x93 Operating and  \nfinancial review\n\nOperating environment  \n\nCredit Suisse \n\nSwiss Universal Bank \n\nInternational  \nWealth Management \n\nAsia Pacific \n\nGlobal Markets \n\nInvestment Banking & Capital Markets \n\nStrategic Resolution Unit \n\nCorporate Center \n\nAssets under management \n\nCritical accounting estimates \n\n \n\n58\n\n61\n\n72\n\n79\n\n86\n\n93\n\n96\n\n99\n\n102\n\n104\n\n107\n\n57\n\n\x0c \n\nOperating environment \n\n \n\nGlobal economic growth decelerated in 2018 as the year progressed. \nGlobal equity markets depreciated in the final quarter and ended the year \nlower and equity market volatility increased significantly.

In the fourth quar-\nter of 2018, the USD yield curve began to partially invert as a \nresult of a more cautious outlook on economic growth (refer to \nthe charts under \xe2\x80\x9cYield curves\xe2\x80\x9d). For the euro, yields gener-\nally decreased and for the Swiss franc, the yield curve steep-\nened. For global fixed income investment grade bonds (includ-\ning both government and credit), the year ended with a positive \nperformance of approximately 1.5% in US dollar hedged terms. \nIn credits, spreads generally widened from the historically tight \nlevel at the beginning of the year (refer to the charts under \xe2\x80\x9cCredit \nspreads\xe2\x80\x9d). Emerging market bonds and convertible bonds were \nthe weakest fixed income segments in 2018. \n\nAmong major currencies, the US dollar was one of the strongest \ncurrencies in 2018. It appreciated from weak levels at the begin-\nning of 2018, and benefited from the continued tightening of US \nmonetary policy and from global risk aversion. The euro depreci-\nated, despite the tapering of quantitative easing by the ECB, as \neconomic momentum slowed and political risks weighed on the \ncurrency, particularly following the Italian elections. The Swiss \nfranc also depreciated against the US dollar over the year, but \nappreciated against the euro as economic and political risks in the \neurozone dominated for large parts of the year. The British pound \nwas particularly under pressure in 2018, as uncertainty around \nthe process of the UK withdrawal from the EU led to a deteriora-\ntion in market sentiment and an increase in volatility. Most emerg-\ning market currencies weakened significantly against the US dol-\nlar in 2018, particularly the Argentine peso and the Turkish lira. \nThe Russian ruble, the Brazilian real and the South African rand \nalso weakened. The Mexican peso, however, held up relatively \nwell against the US dollar in 2018.\n\nThe Credit Suisse Commodities Benchmark ended the year with \na negative return of more than 11%, after substantial gains at the \nbeginning of 2018. Energy saw the most pronounced reversal as \nthe sector changed from being the clear outperformer up until the \nend of the third quarter of 2018 to being among the worst per-\nforming segments in the fourth quarter of 2018 after oil and gas \nprices plunged. Demand concerns and a stronger than expected \nsupply contributed to this weakness. Only industrial metals, which \nare particularly sensitive to growth and trade policies, fared worse \non a full-year comparison. Precious metals were also down for \nthe year amid a strong US dollar. Agricultural prices also declined.\n\nOperating environment \n\n59\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nMarket volumes (growth in % year on year)\n2018\xc2\xa0 \nEquity trading volume\xc2\xa01 \nAnnounced mergers and acquisitions\xc2\xa02 \nCompleted mergers and acquisitions\xc2\xa02 \nEquity underwriting\xc2\xa02 \nDebt underwriting\xc2\xa02 \nSyndicated lending \xe2\x80\x93 investment grade\xc2\xa02 \n\nGlobal   \n9   5\n19   \n13   \n(14)   \n(17)   \n31   \xe2\x80\x93\n\nEurope \n \n\n31 \n22 \n(34) \n(7) \n \n\n1 London Stock Exchange, Borsa Italiana, Deutsche B\xc3\xb6rse and BME.

At the end of 2018, world bank stocks traded more than \n17% lower compared to 2017 (refer to the charts under \xe2\x80\x9cEquity \nmarkets\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\nIn private banking, the industry has experienced a long-term fun-\ndamental growth trend fueled by economic growth and a gener-\nally supportive investment environment despite a market correc-\ntion led by equity markets in the fourth quarter of 2018. Against \nthese supportive market trends, challenges included political \ninstability, worry over the threat from greater protectionism among \nthe largest trade partners and the uncertainty over the impact of \ncentral banks\xe2\x80\x99 withdrawal from a policy of quantitative easing. In \naddition, the private banking sector continued to face pressure as \nit adapts to structural and regulatory changes while pursuing new \nopportunities and efficiencies arising from digital technology.\n\nIn investment banking, global equity trading volumes increased \n9% compared to 2017.

The 2017 results \nincluded income tax expenses of CHF\xc2\xa02,741 million, mainly \nreflecting the re-assessment of deferred tax assets with an associ-\nated tax charge of CHF\xc2\xa02.3 billion, primarily resulting from a reduc-\ntion in the US federal corporate tax rate following the enactment \nof the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in the US during the fourth quarter \nof 2017. In 2018, Credit Suisse reported income before taxes of \nCHF\xc2\xa03,372 million compared to CHF\xc2\xa01,793 million in 2017 and \nadjusted income before taxes of CHF\xc2\xa04,194 million compared to \nCHF\xc2\xa02,762 million in 2017.\n\n2017 results\nIn 2017, Credit Suisse reported a net loss attributable to share-\nholders of CHF\xc2\xa0983 million compared to a net loss attributable \nto shareholders of CHF\xc2\xa02,710 million in 2016. The 2017 results \nincluded income tax expenses of CHF\xc2\xa02,741 million, mainly \nreflecting the re-assessment of deferred tax assets due to the US \ntax reform. The 2016 results included net litigation provisions of \nCHF\xc2\xa02,986 million, primarily relating to the settlement with the \nUS Department of Justice (DOJ) regarding our legacy residential \nmortgage-backed securities (RMBS) business. In 2017, Credit \nSuisse reported income before taxes of CHF\xc2\xa01,793 million and an \nadjusted income before taxes of CHF\xc2\xa02,762 million.\n\n2018 results details\n\nNet revenues\nCompared to 2017, net revenues of CHF\xc2\xa020,920 million were \nstable, primarily reflecting higher net revenues in International \nWealth Management and Swiss Universal Bank and lower \n\nnegative net revenues in the Strategic Resolution Unit, partially \noffset by lower net revenues in Global Markets and Asia Pacific. \nThe increase in net revenues in International Wealth Manage-\nment reflected higher revenues across all revenue categories. \nThe increase in net revenues in Swiss Universal Bank was mainly \ndue to higher recurring commissions and fees, an increase in \nother revenues, reflecting a gain on the sale of its investment in \nEuroclear and gains on the sale of real estate, and slightly higher \nnet interest income. The decrease in negative net revenues in \nthe Strategic Resolution Unit was primarily driven by lower overall \nfunding costs and lower exit costs, partially offset by a reduction \nin fee-based revenues as a result of business exits and higher \nnegative valuation adjustments. The decrease in net revenues \nin Global Markets primarily reflected lower results across fixed \nincome trading and underwriting and reduced cash equities rev-\nenues due to less favorable market conditions, partially offset by \nincreased International Trading Solutions (ITS) performance due \nto substantially higher equity derivatives revenues. The decrease \nin net revenues in Asia Pacific was driven by lower revenues in its \nMarkets business across all revenue categories.\n\nProvision for credit losses\nIn 2018, we recorded provision for credit losses of CHF\xc2\xa0245 mil-\nlion, primarily reflecting provisions of CHF\xc2\xa0126 million in Swiss \nUniversal Bank, CHF\xc2\xa035 million in International Wealth Manage-\nment and CHF\xc2\xa035 million in Asia Pacific.\n\nTotal operating expenses\nWe reported total operating expenses of CHF\xc2\xa017,303 million in \n2018, a decrease of 8% compared to 2017, primarily due to a \n7% decrease in compensation and benefits and a 13% decrease \nin general and administrative expenses. The decrease in com-\npensation and benefits was mainly due to lower salaries and vari-\nable compensation. The decrease in general and administrative \nexpenses was primarily due to lower professional services and \nlower litigation provisions.\n\n62\n\nCredit Suisse\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nIncome tax expense\nIn 2018, we recorded income tax expense of CHF\xc2\xa01,361 million. \nThe Credit Suisse effective tax rate was 40.4% in 2018, com-\npared to 152.9% in 2017. The effective tax rate for 2018 mainly \nreflected the impact of the geographical mix of results, non-\ndeductible funding costs and tax on own credit gains. Overall, net \ndeferred tax assets decreased CHF\xc2\xa0623 million to CHF\xc2\xa04,505 \nmillion during 2018, mainly driven by earnings.\n\nUS tax reform \xe2\x80\x93 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act\nThe US tax reform enacted on December\xc2\xa022, 2017 resulted in a \nreduction of the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to \n21%, effective as of January\xc2\xa01, 2018. The reform also introduced \nthe US base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT), effective as of \nJanuary\xc2\xa01, 2018. It is broadly levied on tax deductions created by \ncertain payments, e.g. for interest and services, to affiliated group \ncompanies outside the US, in the case where the calculated tax \nbased on a modified taxable income exceeds the amount of ordi-\nnary federal corporate income taxes paid. The standard tax rates \napplicable under BEAT are 5% for 2018, 10% for 2019 until \n2025 and 12.5% from 2026 onward. For certain banking enti-\nties, which management believes will include Credit Suisse, these \nrates are increased by 1% resulting in rates of 6% for 2018, 11% \nfor 2019 until 2025 and 13.5% from 2026 onward. On the basis \nof the current analysis of the BEAT tax regime, following the draft \nregulations issued by the US Department of Treasury on Decem-\nber 13, 2018, Credit Suisse considers it as more likely than not \nthat the Group will be subject to this regime in 2018. On this \nbasis, CHF\xc2\xa065 million has been accrued in the fourth quarter of \n2018 in relation to BEAT. The finalization of US BEAT regulations \nis expected to occur in 2019, at which point the above BEAT \nposition for the tax year 2018 will need to be re-assessed. Pro-\nspectively, additional tax regulations of the US tax reform relating \nto interest deductibility may also impact Credit Suisse.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cNote 28 \xe2\x80\x93 Tax\xe2\x80\x9d in VI \xe2\x80\x93 Consolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit \n\nSuisse Group for further information.\n\nSubsequent event\nIn March 2019, the Group reached a tentative settlement related \nto an existing dispute. As a result, the Group increased its 2018 \nlitigation provision by CHF\xc2\xa033 million in the Corporate & Institu-\ntional Banking business within the Swiss Universal Bank division \nand decreased its estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably \npossible losses not covered by existing provisions from zero to \nCHF\xc2\xa01.5 billion to zero to CHF\xc2\xa01.4 billion.\n\n2017 results details\n\nNet revenues\nCompared to 2016, net revenues of CHF\xc2\xa020,900 million \nincreased 3%, primarily reflecting higher net revenues in Inter-\nnational Wealth Management and Investment Banking & Capital \nMarkets and lower negative net revenues in the Strategic Resolu-\ntion Unit, partially offset by lower net revenues in Swiss Universal \n\nBank. The increase in net revenues in International Wealth Man-\nagement was driven by higher recurring commissions and fees, \nhigher transaction- and performance-based revenues and higher \nnet interest income, partially offset by lower other revenues. The \nincrease in net revenues in Investment Banking & Capital Markets \nwas due to higher revenues from debt underwriting and equity \nunderwriting, partially offset by lower revenues in advisory and \nother fees. The decrease in negative net revenues in the Strate-\ngic Resolution Unit was driven by lower negative valuation adjust-\nments, a reduction in overall funding costs and lower exit losses \nprimarily related to the sale of loan and financing portfolios, \npartially offset by a reduction in fee-based revenues as a result \nof accelerated business exits. The decrease in net revenues in \nSwiss Universal Bank was mainly due to gains on the sale of real \nestate in 2016 of CHF\xc2\xa0366 million.\n\nProvision for credit losses\nIn 2017, we recorded provision for credit losses of CHF\xc2\xa0210 mil-\nlion, primarily reflecting provisions of CHF\xc2\xa075 million in Swiss \nUniversal Bank, CHF\xc2\xa032 million in the Strategic Resolution Unit, \nCHF\xc2\xa031 million in Global Markets and CHF\xc2\xa030 million in Invest-\nment Banking & Capital Markets.\n\nTotal operating expenses\nWe reported total operating expenses of CHF\xc2\xa018,897 million in \n2017, a decrease of 15% compared to 2016, primarily due to a \n31% decrease in general and administrative expenses and a 3% \ndecrease in compensation and benefits. The decrease in general \nand administrative expenses was primarily due to lower litiga-\ntion provisions, mainly due to the settlements in 2016 with the \nDOJ and the National Credit Union Administration Board (NCUA) \nregarding our legacy RMBS business, and lower professional \nservices fees. The decrease in compensation and benefits was \nmainly due to lower salaries and lower discretionary compensation \nexpenses.\n\nIncome tax expense\nIn 2017, we recorded income tax expense of CHF\xc2\xa02,741 mil-\nlion. The Credit Suisse effective tax rate was 152.9% in 2017, \ncompared to (19.5)% in 2016. The effective tax rate for 2017 \nmainly reflected the re-assessment of deferred tax assets, with \nan associated tax charge of CHF\xc2\xa02.3 billion primarily resulting \nfrom the US tax reform, the non-deductible penalty relating to \nthe settlement with the New York State Department of Financial \nServices (DFS) relating to certain areas of our foreign exchange \ntrading business and the impact from recognizing tax contingency \naccruals, partially offset by the impact of the geographical mix \nof results. Overall, net deferred tax assets decreased CHF\xc2\xa0571 \nmillion to CHF\xc2\xa05,128 million during 2017, mainly driven by the re-\nassessment of deferred taxes, earnings and a foreign exchange \nimpact, partially offset by the adoption of new accounting stan-\ndards relating to intra-entity asset transfers rules and share-\nbased payment. Net deferred tax assets on net operating losses \nincreased CHF\xc2\xa035 million to CHF\xc2\xa02,213 million during 2017.\n\nCredit Suisse\n\n63\n\n\x0c \n\nOverview of Results\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0

revenues of CHF\xc2\xa021,628 million were \nstable compared to 2017, primarily reflecting lower net revenues \nin Global Markets and Asia Pacific, partially offset by higher net \nrevenues in International Wealth Management and Swiss Univer-\nsal Bank. Provision for credit losses was CHF\xc2\xa0244 million, primar-\nily related to Swiss Universal Bank, International Wealth Manage-\nment and Asia Pacific. Total operating expenses of CHF\xc2\xa016,631 \nmillion decreased 6% compared to 2017, mainly reflecting a 7% \ndecrease in compensation and benefits and an 7% decrease in \ngeneral and administrative expenses, partially offset by a 52% \nincrease in restructuring expenses. The decrease in compensa-\ntion and benefits was primarily related to the Corporate Center, \nGlobal Markets and Asia Pacific. The decrease in general and \nadministrative expenses was mainly related to the Corporate Cen-\nter, Swiss Universal Bank and International Wealth Management. \nIn 2018, we incurred CHF 605 million of restructuring expenses, \nprimarily related to Global Markets, International Wealth Manage-\nment, Swiss Universal Bank and Investment Banking & Capital \nMarkets.\n\n2017 results\nIn 2017, Core Results net revenues of CHF\xc2\xa021,786 million were \nstable compared to 2016, primarily reflecting higher net revenues \nin International Wealth Management and Investment Banking & \nCapital Markets, offset by lower net revenues in Swiss Univer-\nsal Banking and Asia Pacific. Provision for credit losses was \nCHF\xc2\xa0178 million, primarily reflecting net provisions of CHF\xc2\xa075 \nmillion in Swiss Universal Bank, CHF\xc2\xa031 million in Global Mar-\nkets and CHF\xc2\xa030 million in Investment Banking & Capital Mar-\nkets. Total operating expenses of CHF\xc2\xa017,680 million decreased \nslightly compared to 2016, mainly due to slightly lower general \nand administrative expenses.\n\nAs of the end of 2018, our Bank for International Settlements \n(BIS) common equity tier\xc2\xa01 (CET1) ratio was 12.6% and our risk-\nweighted assets were CHF\xc2\xa0284.6 billion.\n\nThe Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA \n(FINMA) imposed regulatory changes, primarily in respect \nof credit multipliers and banking book securitizations, which \nresulted in additional risk-weighted assets relating to credit risk of \nCHF\xc2\xa06.9 billion in 2018.\n\nAs a result of the significant reduction in the size of the Strate-\ngic Resolution Unit over the last two years, in the first quarter of \n2018 we agreed with FINMA on a change to the methodology for \nthe allocation of risk-weighted assets relating to operational risk \nto our businesses to reflect the changed portfolio in the Strategic \nResolution Unit. Such risk-weighted assets relating to operational \nrisk were reduced in the Strategic Resolution Unit by CHF\xc2\xa08.9 bil-\nlion and allocated primarily to the Corporate Center, Global Mar-\nkets, Investment Banking & Capital Markets and Asia Pacific.\n\nAs previously disclosed, Credit Suisse approached FINMA with \na request to review the appropriateness of the level of the risk-\nweighted assets relating to operational risk in the Strategic Reso-\nlution Unit, given the progress in exiting businesses and reducing \nthe size of the division over the last two years, with the aim of \naligning reductions to the accelerated closure of the Strategic \nResolution Unit by the end of 2018. In the first quarter of 2018, \nwe concluded discussions with FINMA and reduced the level of \nrisk-weighted assets relating to operational risk by CHF\xc2\xa02.5 bil-\nlion, primarily in connection with the external transfer of our US \nprivate banking business, which was reflected in the Corporate \nCenter.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2018, we realigned the allocation of high-\nquality liquid assets (HQLA) to the divisions to match their actual \nbusiness usage in line with our internal risk management guide-\nlines. Any excess HQLA held by legal entities above those levels \nfor local regulatory purposes or economic requirements were allo-\ncated to the Corporate Center. HQLA allocated to the Corporate \nCenter and Asia Pacific increased CHF\xc2\xa035.5 billion and CHF\xc2\xa05.0 \nbillion, respectively, as a result of these measures and decreased \nCHF\xc2\xa013.8 billion, CHF\xc2\xa012.6 billion, CHF\xc2\xa06.7 billion, CHF\xc2\xa06.2 bil-\nlion and CHF\xc2\xa01.2 billion in Swiss Universal Bank, Strategic Reso-\nlution Unit, International Wealth Management, Investment Bank-\ning & Capital Management and Global Markets, respectively.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cCapital management\xe2\x80\x9d in III \xe2\x80\x93 Treasury, Risk, Balance sheet and Off-\n\nbalance sheet for further information.\n\nCredit Suisse\n\n65\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nReconciliation of adjusted results\n\nAdjusted results referred to in this document are non-GAAP \nfinancial measures that exclude goodwill impairment and certain \nother revenues and expenses included in our reported results. \nManagement believes that adjusted results provide a useful \n\npresentation of our operating results for purposes of assessing \nour Group and divisional performance consistently over time, on \na basis that excludes items that management does not consider \nrepresentative of our underlying performance.

The decrease primarily reflected the decreases in \nSwiss Universal Bank, Global Markets and the Strategic Resolu-\ntion Unit as a result of our cost efficiency measures and the right-\nsizing of business activities, partially offset by an increase in Asia \nPacific, primarily due to contractor conversions and strategic hir-\ning.

For this reason, specific individual revenue categories in \nisolation may not be indicative of performance. Certain reclassifi-\ncations have been made to prior periods to conform to the current \npresentation.\n\nAccounting developments\nIn 2018, the Group adopted Accounting Standard Update \n2014-09 \xe2\x80\x9cRevenue from Contracts with Customers\xe2\x80\x9d, a new US \ngenerally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP) standard \npertaining to revenue recognition, which was implemented using \nthe modified retrospective approach with a transition adjustment \nreducing retained earnings by CHF\xc2\xa045 million, net of tax, without \n\n68\n\nCredit Suisse\n\nrestating comparative periods. The new revenue recognition cri-\nteria require a change in the gross and net presentation of certain \nrevenues and expenses, including in relation to certain underwrit-\ning and brokerage transactions, with most of the impact reflected \nin our Investment Banking & Capital Markets, Global Markets and \nAsia Pacific divisions. Both revenues and expenses increased \nCHF\xc2\xa059 million in Investment Banking & Capital Markets and \nCHF\xc2\xa032 million in Global Markets and decreased CHF\xc2\xa026 million \nin Asia Pacific.\n\nIn 2018, the Group also adopted a new US GAAP standard pertain-\ning to the presentation of net periodic benefit costs of pension and \nother post-retirement costs, which was implemented retrospectively \nby restating comparative periods. The new presentation criteria \nrequire the service cost component of the net periodic benefit cost \nto be presented as a compensation expense while other compo-\nnents are to be presented as non-compensation expenses.\n\nInternational Trading Solutions\nAs previously disclosed, effective July\xc2\xa01, 2017 the Global Markets \ndivision entered into an agreement with Swiss Universal Bank and \nInternational Wealth Management whereby it provides central-\nized trading and sales services across the three divisions. These \nservices are now managed as a single business within the Global \nMarkets division, referred to as ITS. Effective in the first quarter \nof 2018, the reporting according to the agreement was updated.\n\nWith a continued focus on developing our ITS business and to \nmore closely reflect levels of client usage and the downsizing \nof our wholesale US rates business, we recalibrated the risk-\nweighted assets and leverage exposure allocations from ITS in \nGlobal Markets to Swiss Universal Bank and International Wealth \nManagement. \n\nReturn on regulatory capital\nCredit Suisse measures firm-wide returns against total sharehold-\ners\xe2\x80\x99 equity and tangible shareholders\xe2\x80\x99 equity (a non-GAAP finan-\ncial measure). In addition, it also measures the efficiency of the \nfirm and its divisions with regard to the usage of capital as deter-\nmined by the minimum requirements set by regulators. This regu-\nlatory capital is calculated as the worst of 10% of risk-weighted \nassets and 3.5% of leverage exposure. Return on regulatory \ncapital is calculated using income/(loss) after tax and assumes a \ntax rate of 30% and capital allocated based on the worst of 10% \nof average risk-weighted assets and 3.5% of average leverage \nexposure. These percentages are used in the calculation in order \nto reflect the 2019 fully phased-in Swiss regulatory minimum \nrequirements for Basel\xc2\xa0III CET1 capital and leverage ratio. For \nGlobal Markets and Investment Banking & Capital Markets, return \non regulatory capital is based on US dollar denominated numbers. \nAdjusted return on regulatory capital is calculated using adjusted \nresults, applying the same methodology used to calculate return \non regulatory capital.\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nEnd of / in 2018 (CHF billion, except where indicated)\n\nShareholders\xe2\x80\x99 equity \nReturn on equity \n\nTangible shareholders\xe2\x80\x99 equity \nReturn on tangible shareholders\xe2\x80\x99 equity \n\n \n4.7%\n\n \n5.4%\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n43.9\n\n38.9\n\n5.0\n\nRegulatory capital \nReturn on regulatory capital  \n\n  30.8\n\n8.1\n\n7.4%\n\n \nCapital distribution proposal\nOur Board of Directors will propose to the shareholders at the \nAnnual General Meeting on April\xc2\xa026, 2019 a distribution of \nCHF\xc2\xa00.2625 per share out of capital contribution reserves for the \nfinancial year 2018. The distribution will be free of Swiss with-\nholding tax and will not be subject to income tax for Swiss resi-\ndent individuals holding the shares as a private investment. The \ndistribution will be payable in cash.\n\nPresentation currency\nWe are evaluating the appropriateness of a transition of the \nGroup\xe2\x80\x99s presentation currency from Swiss francs to US dollars. \nWe are currently analyzing the potential benefits and impacts of \nsuch a transition, which will be discussed with our Board of Direc-\ntors in due course.\n\nPotential replacement of interbank offered rates\nThere is significant international and regulatory pressure to \nreplace the current interbank offered rates benchmarks (IBORs), \nincluding LIBOR, with alternative reference rates. In December \n2018, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA \n(FINMA) referenced the legal risks, valuation risks and risks in \nrelation to operational readiness involved and will further discuss \nthese risks with the institutions it supervises. Additionally, from \nJanuary 2019 onward, FINMA is contacting the supervised insti-\ntutions that are particularly affected and is reviewing how these \nrisks are identified, mitigated and monitored.\n\nWe have a significant number of liabilities and assets linked to \ncertain indices, such as IBORs. There is ongoing work through \nnumerous industry bodies and working groups to determine \nreplacement benchmarks, including assessing the practicability of \nusing alternative rates. We have established a global governance \nstructure and change program to manage the transition.\n\nCompensation and benefits\nCompensation and benefits for a given year reflect the strength \nand breadth of the business results and staffing levels and include \nfixed components, such as salaries, benefits and the amortization \nof share-based and other deferred compensation from prior-year \nawards, and a discretionary variable component. The variable \n\ncomponent reflects the performance-based variable compensa-\ntion for the current year. The portion of the performance-based \ncompensation for the current year deferred through share-based \nand other awards is expensed in future periods and is subject to \nvesting and other conditions.\n\nOur shareholders\xe2\x80\x99 equity reflects the effect of share-based com-\npensation. Share-based compensation expense (which is gen-\nerally based on fair value at the time of grant) reduces equity; \nhowever, the recognition of the obligation to deliver the shares \nincreases equity by a corresponding amount. Equity is generally \nunaffected by the granting and vesting of share-based awards \nand by the settlement of these awards through the issuance of \nshares from approved conditional capital. The Group may issue \nshares from conditional capital to meet its obligations to deliver \nshare-based compensation awards. If Credit Suisse purchases \nshares from the market to meet its obligation to employees, these \npurchased treasury shares reduce equity by the amount of the \npurchase price.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cCompensation\xe2\x80\x9d in V \xe2\x80\x93 Compensation for further information.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cConsolidated statements of changes in equity\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cNote 29 \xe2\x80\x93 \n\nEmployee deferred compensation\xe2\x80\x9d in VI \xe2\x80\x93 Consolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 \nCredit Suisse Group for further information.\n\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cTax benefits associated with share-based compensation\xe2\x80\x9d in Note \n28 \xe2\x80\x93 Tax in VI \xe2\x80\x93 Consolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group for \nfurther information.\n\nAllocations and funding\nRevenue sharing\nResponsibility for each product is allocated to a specific segment, \nwhich records all related revenues and expenses. Revenue-\nsharing and service level agreements govern the compensation \nreceived by one segment for generating revenue or providing \nservices on behalf of another. These agreements are negotiated \nperiodically by the relevant segments on a product-by-product \nbasis. The aim of revenue-sharing and service level agree-\nments is to reflect the pricing structure of unrelated third-party \ntransactions.\n\nCost allocation\nCorporate services and business support, including in finance, \noperations, human resources, legal, compliance, risk manage-\nment and IT, are provided by corporate functions, and the related \ncosts are allocated to the segments and the Corporate Cen-\nter based on their respective requirements and other relevant \nmeasures.\n\nFunding\nWe centrally manage our funding activities. New securities for \nfunding and capital purposes are issued primarily by the Bank.\n > Refer to Note 4 \xe2\x80\x93 Segment information in VI \xe2\x80\x93 Consolidated financial state-\n\nments \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group for further information.\n\nCredit Suisse\n\n69\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nFair valuations\nFair value can be a relevant measurement for financial instru-\nments when it aligns the accounting for these instruments with \nhow we manage our business. The levels of the fair value hier-\narchy as defined by the relevant accounting guidance are not a \nmeasurement of economic risk, but rather an indication of the \nobservability of prices or valuation inputs.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cNote 1 \xe2\x80\x93 Summary of significant accounting policies\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cNote 35 \n\n\xe2\x80\x93 Financial instruments\xe2\x80\x9d in VI \xe2\x80\x93 Consolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit \nSuisse Group for further information.\n\nThe fair value of the majority of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s financial instruments \nis based on quoted prices in active markets (level\xc2\xa01) or observ-\nable inputs (level\xc2\xa02). These instruments include government \nand agency securities, certain commercial paper, most invest-\nment grade corporate debt, certain high yield debt securities, \nexchange-traded and certain over-the-counter (OTC) derivative \ninstruments and most listed equity securities.\n\nIn addition, the Group holds financial instruments for which no \nprices are available and which have few or no observable inputs \n(level 3). For these instruments, the determination of fair value \nrequires subjective assessment and judgment depending on \nliquidity, pricing assumptions, the current economic and competi-\ntive environment and the risks affecting the specific instrument. \nIn such circumstances, valuation is determined based on man-\nagement\xe2\x80\x99s own judgments about the assumptions that market \nparticipants would use in pricing the asset or liability (includ-\ning assumptions about risk). These instruments include certain \nOTC derivatives, including interest rate, foreign exchange, equity \nand credit derivatives, certain corporate equity-linked securities, \nmortgage-related and collateralized debt obligation (CDO) securi-\nties, private equity investments, certain loans and credit products, \nincluding leveraged finance, certain syndicated loans and certain \nhigh yield bonds.\n\nModels were used to value financial instruments for which no \nprices are available and which have little or no observable inputs \n(level\xc2\xa03). Models are developed internally and are reviewed by \nfunctions independent of the front office to ensure they are \nappropriate for current market conditions. The models require \nsubjective assessment and varying degrees of judgment depend-\ning on liquidity, concentration, pricing assumptions and risks \naffecting the specific instrument. The models consider observable \nand unobservable parameters in calculating the value of these \nproducts, including certain indices relating to these products. \nConsideration of these indices is more significant in periods of \nlower market activity.\n\nAs of the end of 2018, 37% and 25% of our total assets and \ntotal liabilities, respectively, were measured at fair value.\n\nThe majority of our level\xc2\xa03 assets are recorded in our investment \nbanking businesses. Total assets at fair value recorded as level\xc2\xa03 \ninstruments decreased CHF\xc2\xa00.3 billion to CHF\xc2\xa016.3 billion as \nof the end of 2018, primarily reflecting net settlements, mainly \nin loans, loans held-for-sale and investment securities, par-\ntially offset by net transfers, mainly in loans, and realized/unre-\nalized gains/(losses), mainly in trading assets and investments \nsecurities.\n\nAs of the end of 2018, these assets comprised 2% of total \nassets and 6% of total assets measured at fair value, stable com-\npared to the end of 2017.\n\nWe believe that the range of any valuation uncertainty, in the \naggregate, would not be material to our financial condition; how-\never, it may be material to our operating results for any particu-\nlar period, depending, in part, upon the operating results for such \nperiod.\n\n70\n\nCredit Suisse\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nGroup and Bank differences\n\nThe business of the Bank is substantially the same as the busi-\nness of Credit Suisse Group, and substantially all of the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s \noperations are conducted through the Swiss Universal Bank, \nInternational Wealth Management, Asia Pacific, Global Markets, \nInvestment Banking & Capital Markets and, until December 31, \n2018, the Strategic Resolution Unit segments. Certain Corporate \n\nCenter activities of the Group, such as hedging activities relating to \nshare-based compensation awards, are not applicable to the Bank. \nCertain other assets, liabilities and results of operations, primarily \nrelating to Credit Suisse Services AG (our Swiss service company) \nand its subsidiary, are managed as part of the activities of the \nGroup\xe2\x80\x99s segments.

Net revenues of CHF\xc2\xa05,564 mil-\nlion increased slightly compared to 2017, mainly due to higher \nrecurring commissions and fees, the increase in other revenues, \nreflecting a gain on the sale of our investment in Euroclear of \nCHF\xc2\xa037 million and gains on the sale of real estate of CHF\xc2\xa021 \nmillion, and slightly higher net interest income. Higher recur-\nring commissions and fees were mainly driven by higher wealth \nstructuring solution fees, higher fees from lending activities and \n\nincreased investment advisory fees. Slightly higher net interest \nincome reflected higher deposit margins on slightly lower average \ndeposit volumes and stable loan margins on stable average loan \nvolumes. Transaction-based revenues were stable. Provision for \ncredit losses was CHF\xc2\xa0126 million in 2018 on a net loan portfolio \nof CHF\xc2\xa0168.4 billion. Total operating expenses decreased 7%, \nprimarily driven by lower professional and contractor services \nfees, decreased allocated corporate function costs and lower sal-\nary expenses, partially offset by higher restructuring expenses, \nreflecting targeted headcount reductions and charges relating \nto reductions in office space. Adjusted income before taxes of \nCHF\xc2\xa02,205 million increased 18% compared to 2017.\n\n       \n2018   \n\nin / end of   \n2016   \n\n   \n\n2017   \n\n18 / 17   \n\n% change \n17 / 16 \n\n5,564   \n126   \n1,887   \n1,097   \n228   \n101   \n1,426   \n3,313   \n2,125   \n\n5,396   \n75   \n1,957   \n1,251   \n289   \n59   \n1,599   \n3,556   \n1,765   \n\n5,759   3\n79   \n2,031   \n1,281   \n283   \n60   \n1,624   \n3,655   \n2,025   \n\n   \n68   \n(4)   \n(12)   \n(21)   2\n71   \n(11)   \n(7)   \n20   \n\n16.8   \n59.5   \n\n13.7   \n65.9   \n\n16.5   \xe2\x80\x93\n63.5   \xe2\x80\x93\n\n   \xe2\x80\x93\n   \xe2\x80\x93\n\n11,950   \n1,780   \n\n12,600   \n1,840   \n\n13,140   \n1,970   \n\n(5)   \n(3)   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n(6) \n(5) \n(4) \n(2) \n \n\n(2) \n(2) \n(3) \n(13) \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n(4) \n(7) \n\nDivisional results\n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\nStatements of operations (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \n \nNet revenues\xc2\xa0 \nProvision for credit losses\xc2\xa0 \nCompensation and benefits\xc2\xa0 \nGeneral and administrative expenses\xc2\xa0 \nCommission expenses\xc2\xa0 \nRestructuring expenses\xc2\xa0 \nTotal other operating expenses\xc2\xa0 \nTotal operating expenses\xc2\xa0 \nIncome before taxes\xc2\xa0 \n\nStatement of operations metrics (%)\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \n \nReturn on regulatory capital\xc2\xa0 \nCost/income ratio\xc2\xa0 \n\nNumber of employees and relationship managers\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \n \nNumber of employees (full-time equivalents)\xc2\xa0 \nNumber of relationship managers\xc2\xa0 \n\n72\n\nSwiss Universal Bank\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nDivisional results (continued)\n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\nNet revenues (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \n \nPrivate Clients\xc2\xa0 \nCorporate & Institutional Clients\xc2\xa0 \nNet revenues\xc2\xa0 \n\nNet revenue detail (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \n \nNet interest income\xc2\xa0 \nRecurring commissions and fees\xc2\xa0 \nTransaction-based revenues\xc2\xa0 \nOther revenues\xc2\xa0 7\nNet revenues\xc2\xa0 \n\nProvision for credit losses (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \n \nNew provisions\xc2\xa0 \nReleases of provisions\xc2\xa0 \nProvision for credit losses\xc2\xa0 \n\nBalance sheet statistics (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \n \nTotal assets\xc2\xa0 \nNet loans\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which Private Clients\xc2\xa0 \nRisk-weighted assets\xc2\xa0 \nLeverage exposure\xc2\xa0 \n\n       \n2018   \n\nin / end of   \n2016   \n\n   \n\n2017   \n\n18 / 17   \n\n% change \n17 / 16 \n\n2,989   \n2,575   \n5,564   \n\n2,946   \n1,515   \n1,096   \n   \n5,564   \n\n201   \n(75)   \n126   \n\n2,897   \n2,499   \n5,396  \n\n2,896   \n1,446   \n1,107   \n(53)   \n5,396  \n\n158   \n(83)   \n75  \n\n3,258   3\n2,501   3\n5,759   3\n\n2,884   2\n1,446   5\n1,112   \n317   \xe2\x80\x93\n5,759   3\n\n150   \n(71)   \n79   \n\n224,301   \n168,393   \n113,403   \n76,475   \n255,480   \n\n228,857   \n165,041   \n111,222   \n65,572   \n257,054   \n\n228,363   \n165,685   2\n109,554   2\n65,669   \n252,889   \n\n   \n   0\n   \n\n   0\n   0\n(1)   0\n   \xe2\x80\x93\n   \n\n27   5\n(10)   \n68   \n\n(2)   0\n   0\n   2\n17   0\n(1)   2\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n(11) \n \n\n(6) \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n(6) \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n17 \n(5) \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nNet interest income includes a term spread credit on stable deposit funding and a term spread charge on loans.

Total operating expenses decreased slightly, \nprimarily driven by lower compensation and benefits reflect-\ning lower salary expenses and lower pension expenses. General \nand administrative expenses decreased slightly, mainly due to \nlower contractor and professional services fees, lower occupancy \n\nexpenses and decreased advertising and marketing expenses. \nAdjusted income before taxes of CHF\xc2\xa01,873 million was 8% \nhigher compared to 2016.\n\nCapital and leverage metrics\nAs of the end of 2018, we reported risk-weighted assets of \nCHF\xc2\xa076.5 billion, an increase of CHF\xc2\xa010.9 billion compared to \nthe end of 2017, primarily driven by business growth and meth-\nodology changes, mainly reflecting the phase-in of the Swiss \nmortgage multipliers.

Net interest income of CHF\xc2\xa01,226 million \nwas stable, with slightly higher loan margins on stable average \nloan volumes, offset by lower deposit margins on higher average \ndeposit volumes. Transaction-based revenues of CHF\xc2\xa0694 million \nwere stable, with lower revenues from ITS, offset by increased \nrevenues from our Swiss investment banking business and our \nprofit share from the sale of an investment from our Swiss ven-\nture capital vehicle. \n\nProvision for credit losses\nThe Corporate & Institutional Clients loan portfolio has relatively \nlow concentrations and is mainly secured by real estate, securi-\nties and other financial collateral.\n\nIn 2017, Corporate & Institutional Clients recorded provision for \ncredit losses of CHF\xc2\xa033 million compared to CHF\xc2\xa040 million in \n2016. The decrease reflected higher releases of provision for \ncredit losses relating to several individual cases and a recovery \ncase of CHF\xc2\xa08 million, partially offset by higher new provisions.\n\nTotal operating expenses\nCompared to 2016, total operating expenses of CHF\xc2\xa01,502 mil-\nlion decreased slightly, primarily reflecting lower general and \nadministrative expenses and lower commission expenses, par-\ntially offset by slightly higher compensation and benefits. General \nand administrative expenses of CHF\xc2\xa0479 million decreased 5%, \nmainly driven by lower allocated corporate function costs. Com-\npensation and benefits of CHF\xc2\xa0869 million were slightly higher, \ndriven by higher allocated corporate function costs, partially offset \nby lower discretionary compensation expenses and lower pension \nexpenses. \n\nAssets under management\n\nAs of the end of 2018, assets under management of CHF\xc2\xa0348.7 \nbillion were CHF\xc2\xa06.0 billion lower compared to the end of 2017, \nmainly driven by unfavorable market movements, partially offset \nby net new assets of CHF\xc2\xa08.6 billion. Net new assets primarily \nreflected positive contributions from our pension business.\n\nAs of the end of 2017, assets under management of CHF\xc2\xa0354.7 \nbillion were CHF\xc2\xa015.4 billion higher compared to the end of 2016, \nmainly driven by favorable market movements. Net asset out-\nflows of CHF\xc2\xa013.9 billion were primarily due to redemptions of \nCHF\xc2\xa013.3 billion from a single public sector mandate in the third \nquarter of 2017.\n\n78\n\nSwiss Universal Bank\n\n\x0c \n\nInternational  \nWealth Management\nIn 2018, we reported income before taxes of CHF\xc2\xa01,705 million and \nnet revenues of CHF\xc2\xa05,414 million. Income before taxes increased 26% \ncompared to 2017, primarily reflecting higher net revenues. \n\n \n\nResults summary\n\n2018 results\nIn 2018, income before taxes of CHF\xc2\xa01,705 million increased \n26% compared to 2017. Net revenues of CHF\xc2\xa05,414 mil-\nlion increased 6% compared to 2017, reflecting higher reve-\nnues across all revenue categories. Higher net interest income \nreflected higher deposit margins and lower loan margins on higher \naverage deposit and loan volumes. Higher recurring commissions \nand fees were mainly driven by higher asset management fees \nand higher fees from lending activities. Other revenues in 2018 \nreflected a gain on the sale of our investment in Euroclear of \nCHF\xc2\xa037 million in Private Banking and revenues from a business \ndisposal in Asset Management. Other revenues in 2017 included \nan investment loss from Asset Management Finance LLC (AMF) \n\nand a loss from a business disposal relating to our systematic \nmarket making business. Transaction- and performance-based \nrevenues increased CHF\xc2\xa014 million, mainly reflecting increased \nclient activity, higher revenues from ITS and higher corporate \nadvisory fees related to integrated solutions in Private Banking. \nThis increase was offset by lower performance and placement \nrevenues mainly from Asset Management. Provision for credit \nlosses was CHF\xc2\xa035 million on a net loan portfolio of CHF\xc2\xa051.7 \nbillion. Total operating expenses decreased slightly compared to \n2017, primarily driven by lower litigation provisions, slightly lower \nsalary expenses and decreased professional and contractor \nservices fees, partially offset by higher restructuring expenses, \nreflecting the results of our cost efficiency measures. Adjusted \nincome before taxes of CHF\xc2\xa01,810 million increased 21% com-\npared to 2017.\n\nDivisional results\n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\nStatements of operations (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \n \nNet revenues\xc2\xa0 \nProvision for credit losses\xc2\xa0 \nCompensation and benefits\xc2\xa0 \nGeneral and administrative expenses\xc2\xa0 \nCommission expenses\xc2\xa0 \nRestructuring expenses\xc2\xa0 \nTotal other operating expenses\xc2\xa0 \nTotal operating expenses\xc2\xa0 \nIncome before taxes\xc2\xa0 \n\nStatement of operations metrics (%)\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \n \nReturn on regulatory capital\xc2\xa0 \nCost/income ratio\xc2\xa0 \n\nNumber of employees (full-time equivalents)\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \n \nNumber of employees\xc2\xa0 \n\n       \n2018   \n\nin / end of   \n2016   \n\n   \n\n2017   \n\n18 / 17   \n\n% change \n17 / 16 \n\n5,414   \n35   \n2,303   \n1,029   \n227   \n115   \n1,371   \n3,674   \n1,705   \n\n5,111   \n27   \n2,278   \n1,141   \n244   \n70   \n1,455   \n3,733   \n1,351   \n\n4,698   6\n20   \n2,168   1\n1,096   \n239   \n54   \n1,389   \n3,557   \n1,121   \n\n30.7   \n67.9   \n\n25.8   \n73.0   \n\n23.3   \xe2\x80\x93\n75.7   \xe2\x80\x93\n\n10,210   \n\n10,250   \n\n10,300   0\n\n   \n30   \n   5\n(10)   4\n(7)   2\n64   \n(6)   5\n(2)   5\n26   \n\n   \xe2\x80\x93\n   \xe2\x80\x93\n\n   0\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n9 \n35 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n30 \n \n\n \n\n21 \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nInternational  Wealth Management\n\n79\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nDivisional results (continued)\n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\nNet revenues (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \n \nPrivate Banking\xc2\xa0 \nAsset Management\xc2\xa0 \nNet revenues\xc2\xa0 \n\nNet revenue detail (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \n \nNet interest income\xc2\xa0 \nRecurring commissions and fees\xc2\xa0 \nTransaction- and performance-based revenues\xc2\xa0 \nOther revenues\xc2\xa0 \nNet revenues\xc2\xa0 \n\nProvision for credit losses (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \n \nNew provisions\xc2\xa0 \nReleases of provisions\xc2\xa0 \nProvision for credit losses\xc2\xa0 \n\nBalance sheet statistics (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \n \nTotal assets\xc2\xa0 \nNet loans\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which Private Banking\xc2\xa0 \nRisk-weighted assets\xc2\xa0 \nLeverage exposure\xc2\xa0 \n\n       \n2018   \n\nin / end of   \n2016   \n\n   \n\n2017   \n\n18 / 17   \n\n% change \n17 / 16 \n\n3,890   \n1,524   \n5,414   \n\n1,568   \n2,233   \n1,630   \n(17)   \n5,414   \n\n56   \n(21)   \n35   \n\n3,603   \n1,508   \n5,111  \n\n1,449   \n2,135   \n1,616   \n(89)   \n5,111  \n\n49   \n(22)   \n27  \n\n3,371   8\n1,327   1\n4,698   6\n\n1,308   8\n1,914   5\n1,426   1\n50   \n4,698   6\n\n55   \n(35)   \n20   \n\n91,835   \n51,695   \n51,684   \n40,116   \n98,556   \n\n94,753   \n50,474   \n50,429   \n38,256   \n99,267   \n\n91,083   \n44,965   2\n44,952   2\n35,252   5\n94,092   \n\n   7\n   \n   \n\n   \n   \n   \n(81)   \xe2\x80\x93\n   \n\n14   \n(5)   \n30   \n\n(3)   4\n   \n   \n   \n(1)   5\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n14 \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n11 \n12 \n13 \n \n\n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n(11) \n(37) \n35 \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n12 \n12 \n9 \n \n\n2017 results\nIn 2017, income before taxes of CHF\xc2\xa01,351 million increased \n21% compared to 2016. Net revenues of CHF\xc2\xa05,111 million \nincreased 9% compared to 2016 driven by higher recurring com-\nmissions and fees, higher transaction- and performance-based \nrevenues and higher net interest income. These increases were \npartially offset by lower other revenues. Higher recurring commis-\nsions and fees were mainly driven by higher asset management \nfees, higher investment product management fees and higher \naverage assets under management. These increases were par-\ntially offset by lower discretionary mandate management fees. \nHigher transaction- and performance-based revenues mainly \nreflected higher performance and placement fees in Asset Man-\nagement and higher brokerage and product issuing fees in Pri-\nvate Banking, partially offset by lower revenues from ITS. Higher \nnet interest income reflected higher loan and deposit margins on \nhigher average loan and deposit volumes. Other revenues were \nlower mainly as 2016 included a gain on the sale of real estate \n\nin Private Banking compared to the investment loss from AMF \nand the loss from the business disposal relating to our systematic \nmarket making business in 2017 in Asset Management. Provi-\nsion for credit losses was CHF\xc2\xa027 million on a net loan portfolio \nof CHF\xc2\xa050.5 billion. The 5% increase in total operating expenses \ncompared to 2016 was primarily driven by higher discretionary \ncompensation expenses, higher litigation provisions and higher \nsalary expenses, partially offset by lower contractor and profes-\nsional services fees.

Adjusted net revenues of CHF\xc2\xa03,603 \nmillion increased 9% compared to 2016.\n\nProvision for credit losses\nIn 2017, Private Banking recorded provision for credit losses of \nCHF\xc2\xa027 million, compared to CHF\xc2\xa020 million in 2016, including a \nsmall number of cases in Europe and related to ship finance.\n\nTotal operating expenses\nCompared to 2016, total operating expenses of CHF\xc2\xa02,552 mil-\nlion increased slightly, mainly reflecting slightly higher compensa-\ntion and benefits and higher commission expenses. Compensa-\ntion and benefits of CHF\xc2\xa01,540 million increased slightly, mainly \nreflecting higher discretionary compensation expenses, higher \ndeferred compensation expenses from prior-year awards and \nincreased social security expenses, partially offset by lower sal-\nary expenses. General and administrative expenses of CHF\xc2\xa0782 \nmillion were stable with higher litigation provisions offset by lower \nprofessional services fees.

Revenues from this interest \nare recognized as investment and partnership income rather than \nmanagement fees and performance and placement revenues as \npreviously reported. Prior periods have been reclassified to conform \nto the current presentation.\n\nNet revenues\nCompared to 2017, net revenues of CHF\xc2\xa01,524 million were \nstable, with higher management fees and investment and part-\nnership income, partially offset by significantly lower performance \nand placement revenues. Management fees of CHF\xc2\xa01,107 mil-\nlion increased 9%, mainly reflecting higher average assets under \nmanagement. Investment and partnership income of CHF\xc2\xa0224 \nmillion increased 10%, mainly driven by a gain on the partial sale of \nan economic interest in a third-party manager relating to a private \nequity investment and the investment loss of CHF\xc2\xa043 million from \nAMF in 2017. These increases were partially offset by the absence \nof revenues from the systematic market making business due to \nthe spin-off. Performance and placement revenues of CHF\xc2\xa0193 \nmillion decreased 34%, reflecting lower performance fees due to \na strong investment performance of a fund in 2017, investment-\nrelated losses compared to gains in 2017 and lower placement \n\nInternational Wealth Management \n\n83\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nfees, partially offset by revenues from the business disposal in \n2018.

Compen-\nsation and benefits of CHF\xc2\xa0704 million decreased 5%, mainly \nreflecting lower discretionary compensation expenses and lower \ndeferred compensation expenses from prior-year awards. Gen-\neral and administrative expenses of CHF\xc2\xa0349 million decreased \nslightly, mainly reflecting lower allocated corporate function costs \nand lower professional services fees. Adjusted total operating \nexpenses of CHF\xc2\xa01,079 million decreased 7% compared to 2017.\n\n2017 results details\n\nIncome before taxes of CHF\xc2\xa0327 million increased 17% com-\npared to 2016, with higher net revenues partially offset by higher \ntotal operating expenses. Adjusted income before taxes of \nCHF\xc2\xa0381 million increased 33% compared to 2016.\n\nNet revenues\nCompared to 2016, net revenues of CHF\xc2\xa01,508 million increased \n14%, with higher management fees and significantly higher \n\nperformance and placement revenues, partially offset by lower \ninvestment and partnership income. Management fees of \nCHF\xc2\xa01,011 million increased 14%, mainly reflecting higher aver-\nage assets under management. Performance and placement \nrevenues of CHF\xc2\xa0293 million increased 40%, mainly reflecting \nhigher performance fees including the strong investment perfor-\nmance of a fund in 2017 and higher placement fees. Investment \nand partnership income of CHF\xc2\xa0204 million decreased 12%, pri-\nmarily reflecting the investment loss of CHF\xc2\xa043 million from AMF \nin 2017 compared to a residual gain from a private equity interest \nof CHF\xc2\xa045 million in 2016. Adjusted net revenues of CHF\xc2\xa01,536 \nmillion increased 16% compared to 2016.\n\nTotal operating expenses\nCompared to 2016, total operating expenses of CHF\xc2\xa01,181 mil-\nlion increased 13%, driven by higher compensation and benefits \nand higher general and administrative expenses. Compensation \nand benefits of CHF\xc2\xa0738 million increased 11%, reflecting higher \nsalary expenses and higher discretionary compensation expenses, \npartially offset by lower deferred compensation expenses from \nprior-year awards. Higher salary expenses mainly reflected the \nstrong investment performance of a fund and the transition of the \nsystematic market making business from Global Markets to Inter-\nnational Wealth Management. General and administrative expenses \nof CHF\xc2\xa0359 million increased 17% mainly reflecting higher pro-\nfessional services fees.

Income before taxes decreased 9% \ncompared to 2017, reflecting the challenging market conditions in the \nsecond half of 2018.\n\nResults summary\n\n2018 results \nIn 2018, income before taxes of CHF\xc2\xa0664 million decreased 9% \ncompared to 2017 due to lower net revenues and higher provi-\nsion for credit losses, partially offset by lower total operating \nexpenses. In 2018, the US GAAP accounting standard pertain-\ning to revenue recognition was adopted. As a result, both net \nrevenues and operating expenses in Asia Pacific decreased CHF \n27 million. Lower net revenues of CHF\xc2\xa03,393 million were driven \nby lower revenues in our Markets business across all revenue cat-\negories. Lower equity sales and trading revenues were primarily \ndriven by weaker results in equity derivatives, reflecting reduced \nclient activity and a difficult trading environment in the second half \nof 2018. Lower fixed income sales and trading revenues were \n\nprimarily driven by a weaker performance in rates, partially off-\nset by higher revenues in foreign exchange products, structured \nproducts and credit products. Wealth Management & Connected \nrevenues were stable, mainly reflecting lower transaction-based \nrevenues and lower advisory, underwriting and financing rev-\nenues, offset by higher recurring commissions and fees.

Lower fixed income and trading revenues were \nprimarily driven by decreased client activity in rates and lower rev-\nenues in foreign exchange products due to weaker trading per-\nformance. Lower equity sales and trading revenues were primarily \ndriven by weaker results, reflecting a difficult trading environment \nthat was characterized by persistently low levels of volatility and \nreduced client activity in equity derivatives, and the transition of \nthe systematic market making business to International Wealth \nManagement that was completed in the first quarter of 2017. \nThese decreases were partially offset by higher net revenues in \nour Wealth Management & Connected business, reflecting higher \nPrivate Banking revenues, mainly from higher transaction-based \n\nrevenues, and higher advisory, underwriting and financing reve-\nnues. Compared to 2016, total operating expenses of CHF\xc2\xa02,760 \nmillion decreased slightly, primarily reflecting lower compensa-\ntion and benefits and lower commission expenses, mainly due to \nthe transition of the systematic market making business, partially \noffset by higher restructuring expenses. Adjusted income before \ntaxes of CHF\xc2\xa0792 million increased slightly compared to 2016.\n\nCapital and leverage metrics\nAs of the end of 2018, we reported risk-weighted assets of \nCHF\xc2\xa037.2 billion, an increase of CHF 5.7 billion compared to the \nend of 2017, primarily reflecting business growth in Wealth Man-\nagement & Connected and methodology changes, partly offset \nby lower business usage in Markets. Leverage exposure was \nCHF\xc2\xa0106.4 billion, an increase of CHF 0.8 billion compared to \nthe end of 2017, reflecting higher HQLA, higher lending activi-\nties in Wealth Management & Connected and a foreign exchange \nimpact, partially offset by lower business usage in Markets.\n\nReconciliation of adjusted results\n\xc2\xa0 \nin\xc2\xa0 \n\n       \n\nAdjusted results (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNet revenues\xc2\xa0 \nProvision for credit losses\xc2\xa0 \nTotal operating expenses\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Restructuring expenses\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Major litigation provisions\xc2\xa0 \nAdjusted total operating expenses\xc2\xa0 \nIncome/(loss) before taxes\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Total adjustments\xc2\xa0 \nAdjusted income/(loss) before taxes\xc2\xa0 \n\nWealth Management & Connected   \n2018   \n2016   \n\n2017   \n\n       \n\n2018   \n\n2017   \n\n2016   \n\n2018   \n\n2017   \n\nMarkets       \n\nAsia Pacific \n2016 \n\n2,290   \n25   \n1,574   \n(27)   \n(79)   0\n1,468   \n691   \n106   \n797   \n\n2,322   \n15   \n1,508   \n(21)   \n   0\n1,487   \n799   \n21   \n820   \n\n1,904   \n29   \n1,386   \n(14)   \n   0\n1,372   \n489   \n14   \n503   \n\n1,103   \n10   \n1,120   \n(34)   \n   0\n1,086   \n(27)   \n34   \n7   \n\n1,182   \n\xe2\x80\x93   \n1,252   \n(42)   \n   0\n1,210   \n(70)   \n42   \n(28)   \n\n1,693   \n(3)   \n1,460   \n(39)   \n   \n1,421   \n236   \n39   \n275   \n\n3,393   \n35   \n2,694   \n(61)   \n(79)   0\n2,554   \n664   \n140   \n804   \n\n3,504   \n15   \n2,760   \n(63)   \n   0\n2,697   \n729   \n63   \n792   \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3,597 \n26 \n2,846 \n(53) \n \n\n2,793 \n725 \n53 \n778 \n\nAdjusted return on regulatory capital (%)\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x93\n\n   \xe2\x80\x93\n\n   \xe2\x80\x93\n\n   \xe2\x80\x93\n\n   \xe2\x80\x93\n\n   \xe2\x80\x93\n\n   \n\n14.5   \n\n15.0   \n\n14.8 \n\nAdjusted results are non-GAAP financial measures.

Fixed income sales and trading revenues decreased \n51% to CHF\xc2\xa0262 million, mainly due to decreased client activity \nin rates and lower revenues in foreign exchange products due to \nweaker trading performance. Developed markets rates products \nrevenue in 2016 included a positive impact of CHF\xc2\xa033 million \nresulting from an increase in the funding value of certain struc-\ntured deposits originated in Asia Pacific. Equity sales and trading \nrevenues decreased 21% to CHF\xc2\xa0920 million, mainly due to lower \nrevenues from equity derivatives from weaker trading perfor-\nmance and lower client activity, and the transition of the system-\natic market making business to International Wealth Management \nthat was completed in the first quarter of 2017.

Fixed income sales and trading revenues \nincreased 12%, underwriting revenues increased 17% and \nequity sales and trading revenues declined 19%. Total operat-\ning expenses were CHF\xc2\xa05,070 million, down 7% compared to \n2016, reflecting lower compensation and benefits, reduced allo-\ncated corporate function costs and lower restructuring costs. We \nreported an adjusted income before taxes of CHF\xc2\xa0608 million in \n2017. \n\nCapital and leverage metrics\nAs of the end of 2018, we reported risk-weighted assets of \nUSD\xc2\xa059.8 billion, stable compared to 2017 and in line with \nour 2018 threshold of USD\xc2\xa060 billion. Leverage exposure was \nUSD\xc2\xa0249.1 billion, in line with our 2018 threshold of USD\xc2\xa0290 \nbillion. Leverage exposure decreased USD\xc2\xa041.4 billion compared \nto 2017, reflecting lower business activity and the ITS recalibra-\ntion in the second quarter of 2018. \n\n2018 results details\n\nRevenues reflected a change in the intra-divisional funding cost \nallocation methodology between fixed income sales and trading \nand equity sales and trading in the fourth quarter of 2018 due \nto ongoing work on the implementation of the net stable fund-\ning ratio framework. In the first quarter of 2018, the US GAAP \naccounting standard pertaining to revenue recognition was \nadopted. As a result, both net revenues and operating expenses \nin Global Markets increased CHF 32 million in 2018.\n\nFixed income sales and trading\nFixed income sales and trading revenues of CHF\xc2\xa02,649 million \ndecreased 9% compared to 2017, primarily driven by substan-\ntially lower revenues in our credit franchise reflecting challenging \noperating conditions. Securitized products revenues decreased \nsignificantly compared to a strong 2017, reflecting lower client \nactivity across agency and non-agency trading, partially offset by \ncontinued momentum in our asset finance business and a signifi-\ncant gain from the sale of an investment. Global credit products \nrevenues decreased, primarily due to lower leveraged finance \nrevenues, reflecting high levels of volatility and widening US high \nyield spreads in the second half of the year. Emerging markets \nrevenues decreased, reflecting a substantial decline in Brazil trad-\ning due to significantly lower client activity and rationalization of \n\n94\n\nGlobal Markets\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nthe business, partially offset by higher structured credit revenues \nacross regions. In addition, macro products revenues decreased, \nreflecting the adverse impact of rationalizing the business partially \noffset by higher foreign exchange results.\n\nEquity sales and trading\nEquity sales and trading revenues of CHF\xc2\xa01,709 million \ndecreased 2% compared to 2017, primarily reflecting lower cash \nequities and prime services revenues, partially offset by substan-\ntially higher equity derivatives revenues. Cash equities revenues \ndecreased, reflecting lower trading activity. In addition, prime ser-\nvices revenues declined primarily reflecting lower prime brokerage \nin line with market indices and reduced client financing revenues, \npartially offset by higher commissions in listed derivatives. This \nwas partially offset by significantly increased equity derivatives \nrevenues, albeit compared to a subdued 2017, reflecting higher \nvolatility and benefits from continued investments in the business.\n\nUnderwriting\nUnderwriting revenues of CHF\xc2\xa01,047 million decreased 6% \ncompared to 2017, reflecting lower debt issuance activity due to \nhigher market volatility. Debt underwriting revenues decreased, \nprimarily due to lower leveraged finance and investment grade \nrevenues. This was partially offset by higher equity underwriting \nrevenues.\n\nProvision for credit losses\nGlobal Markets recorded a provision for credit losses of CHF\xc2\xa024 \nmillion in 2018 compared to CHF\xc2\xa031\xc2\xa0million in 2017.\n\nTotal operating expenses\nCompared to 2017, total operating expenses of CHF\xc2\xa04,802 mil-\nlion decreased 5%, reflecting lower compensation and benefits, \nreduced general and administrative expenses and lower commis-\nsions expenses, partially offset by higher restructuring expenses. \nCompensation and benefits decreased 9%, reflecting lower \ndeferred compensation expenses from prior-year awards, reduced \ndiscretionary compensation and lower salary expenses. General \nand administrative expenses decreased, reflecting lower profes-\nsional services fees and lower allocated corporate function costs. \nIn addition, we incurred restructuring expenses of CHF\xc2\xa0242 mil-\nlion, reflecting the results of our cost efficiency measures.\n\n2017 results details\n\nRevenues reflected a change in the intra-divisional funding cost \nallocation methodology between fixed income sales and trading \nand equity sales and trading in the fourth quarter of 2017 due \nto ongoing work on the implementation of the net stable funding \nratio framework. \n\nFixed income sales and trading\nFixed income sales and trading revenues of CHF\xc2\xa02,922 million \nincreased 12% compared to 2016, primarily due to substantially \nhigher securitized products revenues reflecting strength across \nall products. This was partially offset by substantially lower macro \nproducts revenues reflecting weak US rates results due to sub-\ndued volatility and our reduced issuance of structured notes. \nEmerging markets revenues decreased, reflecting a substantial \ndecline in Brazil financing due to significantly lower client activity \ncompared to more favorable market conditions in 2016. In addi-\ntion, global credit products revenues decreased, driven by lower \ninvestment grade trading and leveraged finance revenues in light \nof continued low volatility and tighter credit spreads.\n\nEquity sales and trading\nEquity sales and trading revenues of CHF\xc2\xa01,750 million \ndecreased 19% compared to 2016, reflecting lower system-\natic market revenues driven by the transition of the business to \nInternational Wealth Management that was completed in the \nfirst quarter of 2017, coupled with a difficult trading environ-\nment. Equity derivatives revenues decreased significantly due to \ncontinued low levels of volatility, which negatively impacted flow \nderivatives. Prime services revenues declined primarily reflecting \nlower client financing revenues given a low trading volume envi-\nronment. Cash equities revenues were stable in a difficult trading \nenvironment.\n\nUnderwriting\nUnderwriting revenues of CHF\xc2\xa01,115 million increased 17% \ncompared to 2016, reflecting increased issuance activity due to \na low volatility market environment. Debt underwriting revenues \nincreased, primarily due to significantly higher leveraged finance \nrevenues. In addition, equity underwriting revenues increased, \ndue to significantly higher primary issuance volumes.\n\nProvision for credit losses\nGlobal Markets recorded a provision for credit losses of CHF\xc2\xa031 \nmillion in 2017. In 2016 we recorded a release of provision for \ncredit losses of CHF\xc2\xa03\xc2\xa0million. The release of provision reflected \nthe stabilization in the energy sector.\n\nTotal operating expenses\nCompared to 2016, total operating expenses of CHF\xc2\xa05,070 mil-\nlion decreased 7%, reflecting lower compensation and ben-\nefits, reduced general and administrative expenses and lower \nrestructuring costs. Compensation and benefits decreased 6%, \nreflecting lower deferred compensation expenses from prior-year \nawards, lower salary and reduced discretionary compensation \nexpenses. General and administrative expenses decreased, pri-\nmarily due to lower allocated corporate function costs. In addition, \nwe incurred restructuring expenses of CHF\xc2\xa0150 million.\n\nGlobal Markets\n\n95\n\n\x0c \n\nInvestment Banking & Capital Markets\n\n \n\nIn 2018, we reported income before taxes of CHF\xc2\xa0344 million and net \nrevenues of CHF\xc2\xa02,177 million. Net revenues increased 2% compared to \n2017, driven by strong M&A performance but with lower financing activity \nacross the market. \n\nResults summary\n\n2018 results\nIn 2018, we reported income before taxes of CHF\xc2\xa0344 million. \nNet revenues of CHF\xc2\xa02,177 million increased 2% compared \nto 2017, due to higher revenues from advisory and other fees, \npartially offset by lower debt and equity underwriting revenues. \nAdvisory and other fees of CHF\xc2\xa0950 million increased 23%, \nmainly reflecting higher revenues from completed M&A transac-\ntions. Debt underwriting revenues of CHF\xc2\xa0934 million decreased \n\n9%, driven by lower leveraged finance and debt capital market \nrevenues, partially offset by higher derivatives financing revenues. \nEquity underwriting revenues of CHF\xc2\xa0314 million decreased \n19%, driven by decreased follow-on activity, including a loss on \na single block trade, and lower rights offerings, partially offset by \nhigher revenues from equity derivatives and initial public offering \n(IPO) issuances. Total operating expenses of CHF\xc2\xa01,809 million \nincreased 4%, primarily due to higher general and administrative \nexpenses and restructuring expenses.

Debt underwriting revenues of CHF\xc2\xa01,030 million \nincreased 10%, driven by higher leveraged finance revenues, \npartially offset by lower derivatives financing revenues. Equity \nunderwriting revenues of CHF\xc2\xa0386 million increased 24%, pri-\nmarily reflecting an increase in the overall industry-wide fee pool \ndriven by strong IPO activity. Advisory and other fees of CHF\xc2\xa0770 \nmillion decreased 9%, mainly reflecting lower revenues from com-\npleted M&A transactions. Total operating expenses of CHF\xc2\xa01,740 \nmillion increased 3%, primarily due to higher compensation and \nbenefits and restructuring expenses. Adjusted income before \ntaxes was CHF\xc2\xa0411 million in 2017.\n\nCapital and leverage metrics\nAs of the end of 2018, risk-weighted assets were USD\xc2\xa024.5 bil-\nlion, an increase of USD\xc2\xa04.0 billion compared to the end of 2017. \nThe change was primarily driven by growth in the lending portfolio \nand underwriting commitments, the new operational risk alloca-\ntion key in the first quarter of 2018 and the impact of methodol-\nogy changes. We reported leverage exposure of USD\xc2\xa041.0 bil-\nlion, a decrease of USD\xc2\xa03.8 billion compared to the end of 2017, \nprimarily driven by the realignment of our HQLA allocations in the \nfirst quarter of 2018. \n\n2018 results details\n\nIn the first quarter of 2018, the US GAAP accounting standard \npertaining to revenue recognition was adopted. As a result, both \nnet revenues and operating expenses in Investment Banking & \nCapital Markets increased CHF\xc2\xa059 million in 2018.\n\nAdvisory and other fees\nIn 2018, revenues from advisory and other fees of CHF\xc2\xa0950 mil-\nlion increased 23% compared to 2017, primarily driven by higher \nrevenues from completed M&A transactions across the Americas \nand EMEA regions, with share of wallet gains in EMEA. Share \nof wallet refers to our share of the industry-wide fee pool for the \nrespective products.\n\nDebt underwriting\nIn 2018, debt underwriting revenues of CHF\xc2\xa0934 million \ndecreased 9% compared to 2017, primarily driven by lower lever-\naged finance activity and lower revenues from debt capital mar-\nkets, partially offset by increased derivatives financing revenues. \n\nEquity underwriting\nIn 2018, equity underwriting revenues of CHF\xc2\xa0314 million \ndecreased 19% compared to 2017, reflecting a decrease in the \noverall industry-wide fee pool. Performance was impacted by \nlower revenues from follow-on activity, including the loss on a \nsingle block trade, and rights offerings, partially offset by higher \nrevenues from equity derivatives and IPO issuances. \n\nInvestment Banking & Capital Markets\n\n97\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nProvision for credit losses\nIn 2018, Investment Banking & Capital Markets recorded a \nprovision for credit losses of CHF\xc2\xa024 million, driven by adverse \ndevelopments on non-fair valued loans in our corporate lending \nportfolio, partially offset by a release of provisions relating to two \ncounterparties.\n\nTotal operating expenses\nTotal operating expenses of CHF\xc2\xa01,809 million increased 4% \ncompared to 2017, primarily due to higher general and adminis-\ntrative expenses and restructuring expenses. General and admin-\nistrative expenses increased 10%, mainly driven by higher costs \ndue to the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting \nstandard. During 2018 we incurred restructuring expenses of \nCHF\xc2\xa084 million, compared to CHF\xc2\xa042 million incurred in 2017, \nreflecting targeted headcount reductions.\n\n2017 results details\n\nAdvisory and other fees\nIn 2017, revenues from advisory and other fees of CHF\xc2\xa0770 mil-\nlion decreased 9% compared to 2016, mainly reflecting lower \nrevenues from completed M&A transactions, despite an increase \nin our share of wallet for those transactions. Share of wallet refers \nto our share of the industry-wide fee pool for the respective \nproducts.\n\nDebt underwriting\nIn 2017, debt underwriting revenues of CHF\xc2\xa01,030 million \nincreased 10% compared to 2016, driven by significantly higher \nleveraged finance revenues partially offset by lower derivatives \nfinancing revenues. \n\nEquity underwriting\nIn 2017, equity underwriting revenues of CHF\xc2\xa0386 mil-\nlion increased 24% compared to 2016, primarily reflecting an \nincrease in the overall industry-wide fee pool driven by strong IPO \nactivity. \n\nProvision for credit losses\nIn 2017, Investment Banking & Capital Markets recorded a pro-\nvision for credit losses of CHF\xc2\xa030 million including increased \nprovisions reflecting a methodology change for probable losses \ninherent in the portfolio relating to the period of time expected to \nidentify defaults once they have occurred and provisions relating \nto a single counterparty.\n\nTotal operating expenses\nTotal operating expenses of CHF\xc2\xa01,740 million increased 3% \ncompared to 2016, primarily due to higher deferred compen-\nsation expenses from prior year awards, allocated corporate \nfunction costs, mainly reflecting targeted investments in our IT \nand compliance functions, and restructuring expenses. These \nincreases were partially offset by a lower discretionary compensa-\ntion accrual. \n\nGlobal advisory and underwriting revenues\nThe Group\xe2\x80\x99s global advisory and underwriting business operates across multiple business divisions that work in close collaboration with \neach other to generate these revenues.

Negative net revenues of CHF\xc2\xa0886 \nmillion in 2017 were driven by overall funding costs, valuation \nadjustments and exit costs, partially offset by revenues from our \nlegacy cross-border and small markets businesses. Valuation \nadjustments in 2017 primarily reflected mark-to-market losses \non our legacy investment banking portfolio. Provision for credit \nlosses was CHF\xc2\xa032 million in 2017 compared to CHF\xc2\xa0111 mil-\nlion in 2016. Total operating expenses were CHF\xc2\xa01,217 million \nin 2017, including CHF\xc2\xa0796 million of general and administrative \nexpenses, of which CHF\xc2\xa0300 million were litigation provisions, \nand CHF\xc2\xa0332 million of compensation and benefits. In 2017, we \nreported adjusted total operating expenses of CHF\xc2\xa0891 million.\n\nCapital and leverage metrics\nAs of the end of 2018, we reported risk-weighted assets of \nUSD\xc2\xa018.2 billion, a decrease of USD\xc2\xa016.2 billion compared to the \nend of 2017. Leverage exposure was USD\xc2\xa030.0 billion as of the \nend of 2018, reflecting a decrease of USD\xc2\xa031.3 billion compared \nto the end of 2017. These decreases were primarily achieved \nthrough a broad range of transactions, including restructuring, \ncompression and unwinds in the derivatives portfolio, the sale of \nemerging markets and residual ship finance loans and mitigation \nof certain residual illiquid asset management exposures.\n\nDevelopment of the Strategic Resolution Unit\nIn the fourth quarter of 2015, we formed the Strategic Resolu-\ntion Unit to oversee the effective wind-down of businesses and \npositions that did not fit our strategic direction in the most efficient \nmanner possible. Beginning in 2019, the Strategic Resolution \nUnit has ceased to exist as a separate division of the Group. The \nresidual portfolio remaining as of December 31, 2018 is now \nmanaged in an Asset Resolution Unit and will be separately dis-\nclosed within the Corporate Center.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cDevelopment of the Strategic Resolution Unit\xe2\x80\x9d in I \xe2\x80\x93 Information on \nthe company \xe2\x80\x93 Divisions \xe2\x80\x93 Strategic Resolution Unit for further information.\n\n100\n\nStrategic Resolution Unit\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\n2018 results details\n\n2017 results details\n\nNet revenues\nWe reported negative net revenues of CHF\xc2\xa0708 million in 2018 \ncompared to negative net revenues of CHF\xc2\xa0886 million in 2017. \nThe improvement was primarily driven by lower overall funding \ncosts and lower exit costs, partially offset by a reduction in fee-\nbased revenues as a result of business exits and higher negative \nvaluation adjustments.\n\nProvision for credit losses\nProvision for credit losses was CHF\xc2\xa01 million in 2018 compared \nto CHF\xc2\xa032 million in 2017. Provisions in 2017 were primarily \nrelated to corporate loans, the disposal of a portfolio of senior \nfinancing on US middle market loans and ship finance exposures.\n\nTotal operating expenses\nTotal operating expenses of CHF\xc2\xa0672 million decreased by \nCHF\xc2\xa0545 million, a decline of 45% compared to 2017, primarily \ndue to lower general and administrative expenses and lower com-\npensation and benefits. General and administrative expenses of \nCHF\xc2\xa0385 million decreased 52%, including lower litigation provi-\nsions, mainly in connection with mortgage-related matters, and a \nreduction in costs related to the settlements with US authorities \nregarding US cross-border matters, some of which related to the \nwork performed by the DFS monitor. Compensation and benefits \nof CHF\xc2\xa0254 million decreased 23%, primarily as a result of the \nreduced size of the division and various cost reduction initiatives. \nAdjusted total operating expenses were CHF\xc2\xa0530 million in 2018, \ncompared to CHF\xc2\xa0891 million in 2017, a decline of 41%.\n\nNet revenues\nWe reported negative net revenues of CHF\xc2\xa0886 million in 2017 \ncompared to negative net revenues of CHF\xc2\xa01,271 million in 2016. \nThe improvement was driven by lower negative valuation adjust-\nments, a reduction in overall funding costs and lower exit losses \nprimarily related to the sale of loan and financing portfolios, par-\ntially offset by a reduction in fee-based revenues as a result of \naccelerated business exits.\n\nProvision for credit losses\nProvision for credit losses was CHF\xc2\xa032 million in 2017 compared \nto CHF\xc2\xa0111 million in 2016. Provisions in 2017 were primar-\nily related to corporate loans, the disposal of a portfolio of senior \nfinancing on US middle market loans and ship finance exposures. \nProvisions in 2016 were primarily related to the ship finance \nsector.\n\nTotal operating expenses\nTotal operating expenses of CHF\xc2\xa01,217 million decreased \nCHF\xc2\xa03,160 million, a decline of 72% compared to 2016, primar-\nily due to lower general and administrative expenses and lower \ncompensation and benefits. General and administrative expenses \nof CHF\xc2\xa0796 million decreased 78%, including significantly lower \nlitigation provisions, a decrease of CHF\xc2\xa02,492 million as 2016 \nincluded significant litigation provisions of CHF\xc2\xa02,792 million, \nprimarily related to the RMBS settlements. Compensation and \nbenefits of CHF\xc2\xa0332 million decreased 46%, primarily from the \nrestructuring of select onshore businesses, including cost reduc-\ntion initiatives relating to the exit of our US onshore and Western \nEuropean private banking businesses. Total operating expenses \nin 2017 included costs of CHF\xc2\xa0177 million to meet require-\nments related to the settlements with US authorities regarding \nUS cross-border matters, some of which relates to the work per-\nformed by the DFS monitor. Adjusted total operating expenses \nwere CHF\xc2\xa0891 million in 2017, compared to CHF\xc2\xa01,563 million in \n2016, a decline of 43%.\n\nStrategic Resolution Unit\n\n101\n\n\x0c \n\nCorporate Center\n\n \n\nIn 2018, we reported a loss before taxes of CHF\xc2\xa0239 million compared to \na loss of CHF\xc2\xa0736 million in 2017.\n\nCorporate Center composition\n\nCorporate Center includes parent company operations such as \nGroup financing, expenses for projects sponsored by the Group, \nincluding costs associated with the evolution of our legal entity \nstructure to meet developing and future regulatory requirements, \nand certain other expenses and revenues that have not been allo-\ncated to the segments. Corporate Center also includes consolida-\ntion and elimination adjustments required to eliminate intercom-\npany revenues and expenses.\n\nTreasury results include the impact of volatility in the valuations \nof certain central funding transactions such as structured notes \nissuances and swap transactions. Since the second quarter \nof 2017, treasury results have also included additional interest \ncharges from transfer pricing to align funding costs to assets held \nin the Corporate Center.\n\nOther revenues include required elimination adjustments associ-\nated with trading in own shares, treasury commissions charged to \ndivisions and, since the third quarter of 2017, the cost of certain \nhedging transactions executed in connection with the Group\xe2\x80\x99s \nrisk-weighted assets.\n\nCompensation and benefits include fair value adjustments on cer-\ntain deferred compensation plans not allocated to the segments \nand certain deferred compensation retention awards intended to \nsupport the restructuring of the Group, mainly relating to Global \nMarkets and Investment Banking & Capital Markets predomi-\nnantly through the end of 2017 and to Asia Pacific predominantly \n\nthrough the end of 2018. Since the third quarter of 2018, com-\npensation and benefits have also included fair value adjustments \non certain other long-dated legacy deferred compensation and \nretirement programs mainly relating to former employees.\n\nResults summary\n\n2018 results\nIn 2018, we reported a loss before taxes of CHF\xc2\xa0239 million com-\npared to CHF\xc2\xa0736 million in 2017. The decreased loss before taxes \nin 2018 was primarily driven by lower total operating expenses.\n\nNet revenues of CHF\xc2\xa0100 million increased CHF\xc2\xa015 million com-\npared to 2017. Treasury results of CHF\xc2\xa013 million in 2018 mainly \nreflected gains of CHF\xc2\xa0200 million with respect to structured \nnotes volatility, of which CHF\xc2\xa0165 million related to valuation model \nenhancements, gains of CHF\xc2\xa0123 million relating to hedging volatil-\nity and gains of CHF\xc2\xa061 million relating to fair value option volatility \non own debt, partially offset by negative revenues of CHF\xc2\xa0362 mil-\nlion relating to funding activities. Other revenues of CHF\xc2\xa087 mil-\nlion increased CHF\xc2\xa058 million compared to 2017, mainly reflecting \nreduced costs relating to hedging transactions executed in connec-\ntion with the Group\xe2\x80\x99s risk-weighted assets and the elimination of \nlosses from trading in own shares compared to gains in 2017, par-\ntially offset by a negative valuation impact from long-dated legacy \ndeferred compensation and retirement programs and a loss relating \nto the final liquidation of our subsidiary in Johannesburg.\n\nCorporate Center results\n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\nStatements of operations (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \n \nTreasury results\xc2\xa0 \nOther\xc2\xa0 \nNet revenues\xc2\xa0 \nProvision for credit losses\xc2\xa0 \nCompensation and benefits\xc2\xa0 \nGeneral and administrative expenses\xc2\xa0 \nCommission expenses\xc2\xa0 \nRestructuring expenses\xc2\xa0 \nTotal other operating expenses\xc2\xa0 \nTotal operating expenses\xc2\xa0 \nIncome/(loss) before taxes\xc2\xa0 \n\nBalance sheet statistics (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \n \nTotal assets\xc2\xa0 \nRisk-weighted assets\xc2\xa01 \nLeverage exposure\xc2\xa01 \n\n1 Disclosed on a look-through basis.\n\n102\n\nCorporate Center\n\n       \n2018   \n\nin / end of   \n2016   \n\n   \n\n2017   \n\n18 / 17   \n\n% change \n17 / 16 \n\n13   \n87   \n100   \n0   \n128   \n160   \n49   \n2   \n211   \n339   \n(239)   \n\n56   \n29   \n85   \n0   \n398   \n364   \n45   \n14   7\n423   \n821   \n(736)   \n\n(160)   \n231   \n71   \n(1)   \xe2\x80\x93\n270   \n406   \n76   \n   \n489   \n759   \n(687)   \n\n104,411   \n29,703   \n105,247   \n\n67,591   \n23,849   \n67,034   \n\n62,413   \n17,338   \n59,374   \n\n(77)   \xe2\x80\x93\n200   \n18   \n   \n(68)   \n(56)   \n9   \n(86)   \n(50)   \n(59)   8\n(68)   7\n\n54   8\n25   \n57   \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n(87) \n20 \n100 \n47 \n(10) \n(41) \n100 \n(13) \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n38 \n13 \n\n \n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nTotal operating expenses of CHF\xc2\xa0339 million decreased 59% \ncompared to 2017, primarily reflecting decreases in compen-\nsation and benefits and general and administrative expenses. \nCompensation and benefits of CHF\xc2\xa0128 million decreased 68%, \nprimarily reflecting lower deferred compensation expenses from \nprior-year awards and lower retention award expenses. General \nand administrative expenses of CHF\xc2\xa0160 million decreased 56%, \nmainly due to the absence of the impact from the settlement with \nthe DFS in 2017 relating to certain areas of our foreign exchange \ntrading business and reduced expenses relating to the continu-\ning evolution of our legal entity structure. In 2018, we recorded \nexpenses of CHF\xc2\xa0159 million, compared to CHF\xc2\xa0240 million in \n2017, with respect to the evolution of our legal entity structure.\n\nCapital and leverage metrics\nAs of the end of 2018, we reported risk-weighted assets of \nCHF\xc2\xa029.7 billion, reflecting an increase of CHF\xc2\xa05.9 billion com-\npared to the end of 2017. The increase was primarily driven by \nmethodology and policy changes, increased risk levels and model \nand parameter updates.\n\nLeverage exposure was CHF\xc2\xa0105.2 billion as of the end of 2018, \nreflecting an increase of CHF\xc2\xa038.2 billion compared to Decem-\nber\xc2\xa031, 2017, mainly reflecting a CHF\xc2\xa035.5 billion impact from the \nrealignment of our HQLA allocations in the first quarter of 2018.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cRegulatory capital\xe2\x80\x9d in Credit Suisse for further information.\n\n2017 results\nIn 2017, we reported a loss before taxes of CHF\xc2\xa0736 million \ncompared to CHF\xc2\xa0687 million in 2016. The increased loss before \ntaxes in 2017 was primarily driven by higher total operating \nexpenses, partially offset by an increase in net revenues.\n\nNet revenues of CHF\xc2\xa085 million increased CHF\xc2\xa014 mil-\nlion compared to 2016. Treasury results of CHF\xc2\xa056 million in \n2017 reflected gains with respect to structured notes volatil-\nity of CHF\xc2\xa0503 million, partially offset by negative revenues of \nCHF\xc2\xa0257 million relating to funding activities, losses of CHF\xc2\xa0118 \nmillion relating to hedging volatility and losses of CHF\xc2\xa074 million \nrelating to fair-valued money market instruments. The 2017 struc-\ntured notes volatility was substantially composed of the positive \nimpact of CHF\xc2\xa0412 million from the enhancements in the third \nand fourth quarters of 2017 to the valuation methodology relating \nto the instrument-specific credit risk on fair value option elected \nstructured notes, of which CHF\xc2\xa0338 million was reallocated \nbetween accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (AOCI) \nand net income. In 2017, we were in the process of migrating our \nstructured notes portfolio to a new target operating model that \nallows for a more granular and precise valuation of the individual \nnotes. This migration became sufficiently advanced during the \nthird and fourth quarters of 2017 with respect to the rates sub-\nportfolio to allow for this change in estimate.\n\nTotal operating expenses of CHF\xc2\xa0821 million increased 8% \ncompared to 2016, primarily reflecting an increase in compensa-\ntion and benefits, partially offset by a decrease in general and \nadministrative expenses. Compensation and benefits of CHF\xc2\xa0398 \nmillion increased 47%, mainly reflecting higher deferred compen-\nsation expenses from prior year awards. General and admin-\nistrative expenses of CHF\xc2\xa0364 million decreased 10%, mainly \ndue to lower expenses related to the evolution of our legal entity \nstructure, partially offset by a CHF\xc2\xa0127 million impact from the \nsettlement with the DFS relating to certain areas of our foreign \nexchange trading business and the impact from a provision for \nindirect taxes.\n\nExpense allocation to divisions\n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\nExpense allocation to divisions (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \n \nCompensation and benefits\xc2\xa0 \nGeneral and administrative expenses\xc2\xa0 \nCommission expenses\xc2\xa0 \nRestructuring expenses\xc2\xa0 \nTotal other operating expenses\xc2\xa0 \nTotal operating expenses before allocations to divisions\xc2\xa0 \nNet allocation to divisions\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which Swiss Universal Bank\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which International Wealth Management\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which Asia Pacific\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which Global Markets\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which Investment Banking & Capital Markets\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which Strategic Resolution Unit\xc2\xa0 \nTotal operating expenses\xc2\xa0 \n\n       \n\nin / end of       \n\n2018   \n\n2017   \n\n2016   \n\n18 / 17   \n\n% change \n17 / 16 \n\n2,748   \n2,212   \n49   \n372   \n2,633   \n5,381   \n5,042   \n1,056   \n876   \n780   \n1,708   \n358   \n264   \n339   \n\n3,076   \n2,573   \n45   \n158   \n2,776   \n5,852   \n5,031   \n1,078   \n864   \n777   \n1,645   \n346   \n321   \n821   \n\n2,924   \n2,962   \n76   \n166   \n3,204   \n6,128   \n5,369   0\n1,071   \n841   1\n702   0\n1,878   4\n304   3\n573   \n759   \n\n(11)   5\n(14)   \n9   \n135   \n(5)   \n(8)   \n   \n(2)   1\n   3\n   \n   \n   \n(18)   \n(59)   8\n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n(13) \n(41) \n(5) \n(13) \n(5) \n(6) \n \n\n \n\n11 \n(12) \n14 \n(44) \n \n\nCorporate services and business support, including in finance, operations, human resources, legal, compliance, risk management and IT, are provided by corporate functions, and the \nrelated costs are allocated to the segments and the Corporate Center based on their requirements and other relevant measures.\n\nCorporate Center\n\n103\n\n\x0c \n\nAssets under management\n\n \n\nAs of the end of 2018, assets under management were CHF\xc2\xa01,347.3 \nbillion, 2.1% lower compared to the end of 2017, with net new assets of \nCHF\xc2\xa056.5 billion.\n\nAssets under management\n\nAssets under management comprise assets that are placed with \nus for investment purposes and include discretionary and advisory \ncounterparty assets.\n\nDiscretionary assets are assets for which the client fully transfers \nthe discretionary power to a Credit Suisse entity with a manage-\nment mandate.

Any such changes are not directly related to the \nGroup\xe2\x80\x99s success in acquiring assets under management. Similarly \nstructural effects mainly relate to asset inflows and outflows due \nto acquisition or divestiture, exit from businesses or markets or \nexits due to new regulatory requirements and are not taken into \naccount when calculating net new assets. The Group reviews \nrelevant policies regarding client assets on a regular basis. Fol-\nlowing such reviews in 2018, with effect from January 1, 2019, \nthe Group updated its assets under management policy primar-\nily to introduce more specific criteria to evaluate whether client \nassets qualify as assets under management. The introduction \nof this updated policy is expected to result in a reclassification \nof approximately CHF\xc2\xa019 billion of assets under management to \nassets under custody which will be reflected as a structural effect \nin the first quarter of 2019.\n\nResults summary\n\n2018 results \nAs of the end of 2018, assets under management were \nCHF\xc2\xa01,347.3 billion, a decrease of CHF\xc2\xa028.8 billion compared to \nthe end of 2017.

with US GAAP, management is required to make certain \naccounting estimates to ascertain the value of assets and liabili-\nties. These estimates are based upon judgment and the informa-\ntion available at the time, and actual results may differ materially \nfrom these estimates. Management believes that the estimates \nand assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated \nfinancial statements are prudent, reasonable and consistently \napplied.\n\nWe believe that the critical accounting estimates discussed below \ninvolve the most complex judgments and assessments.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cNote 1 \xe2\x80\x93 Summary of significant accounting policies\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cNote 2 \n\xe2\x80\x93 Recently issued accounting standards\xe2\x80\x9d in VI \xe2\x80\x93 Consolidated financial state-\nments \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group for further information on significant accounting \npolicies and new accounting pronouncements. For financial information relat-\ning to the Bank, refer to the corresponding notes in the consolidated financial \nstatements of the Bank.\n\nFair value\n\nA significant portion of our financial instruments is carried at fair \nvalue. The fair value of the majority of these financial instruments \nis based on quoted prices in active markets or observable inputs.\n\nIn addition, we hold financial instruments for which no prices are \navailable and which have few or no observable inputs. For these \ninstruments, the determination of fair value requires subjec-\ntive assessment and judgment, depending on liquidity, pricing \nassumptions, the current economic and competitive environment \nand the risks affecting the specific instrument. In such circum-\nstances, valuation is determined based on management\xe2\x80\x99s own \njudgments about the assumptions that market participants would \nuse in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about \nrisk. These instruments include certain OTC derivatives includ-\ning interest rate, foreign exchange, equity and credit derivatives, \ncertain corporate equity-linked securities, mortgage-related and \nCDO securities, private equity investments and certain loans and \ncredit products, including leveraged finance, certain syndicated \nloans and certain high yield bonds.\n\nWe have availed ourselves of the simplification in account-\ning offered under the fair value option guidance. This has been \naccomplished generally by electing the fair value option, both \nat initial adoption and for subsequent transactions, on items \nimpacted by the hedge accounting requirements of US GAAP. \nFor instruments for which hedge accounting could not be \nachieved but for which we are economically hedged, we have \ngenerally elected the fair value option. Where we manage an \nactivity on a fair value basis but previously have been unable to \nachieve fair value accounting, we have generally utilized the fair \nvalue option to align our financial accounting to our risk manage-\nment reporting.\n\nControl processes are applied to ensure that the fair values of \nthe financial instruments reported in the consolidated financial \n\nstatements, including those derived from pricing models, are \nappropriate and determined on a reasonable basis. \n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cNote 35 \xe2\x80\x93 Financial instruments\xe2\x80\x9d in VI \xe2\x80\x93 Consolidated financial state-\n\nments \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group for further information.\n\nVariable interest entities\n\nAs a normal part of our business, we engage in various transac-\ntions which include entities that are considered variable interest \nentities (VIEs). VIEs are special purpose entities that typically \nlack sufficient equity to finance their activities without additional \nsubordinated financial support or are structured such that the \nholders of the voting rights do not substantively participate in the \ngains and losses of the entity. Such entities are required to be \nassessed for consolidation under US GAAP, compelling the pri-\nmary beneficiary to consolidate the VIE. The primary beneficiary \nis the party that has the power to direct the activities that most \nsignificantly affect the economics of the VIE and has the right to \nreceive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses of the entity \nthat could be potentially significant to the VIE. We consolidate \nall VIEs where we are the primary beneficiary. Application of \nthe accounting requirements for consolidation of VIEs, including \nongoing re-assessment of VIEs for possible consolidation, may \nrequire the exercise of significant management judgment.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cNote 1 \xe2\x80\x93 Summary of significant accounting policies\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cNote 34 \xe2\x80\x93 \nTransfers of financial assets and variable interest entities\xe2\x80\x9d in VI \xe2\x80\x93 Consolidated \nfinancial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group for further information on VIEs.\n\nContingencies and loss \nprovisions\nA contingency is an existing condition that involves a degree of \nuncertainty that will ultimately be resolved upon the occurrence or \nnon-occurrence of future events.\n\nLitigation contingencies\nWe are involved in a number of judicial, regulatory and arbitra-\ntion proceedings concerning matters arising in connection with \nthe conduct of our businesses. Some of these proceedings have \nbeen brought on behalf of various classes of claimants and seek \ndamages of material and/or indeterminate amounts. We accrue \nloss contingency litigation provisions and take a charge to our \nconsolidated statements of operations in connection with certain \nproceedings when losses, additional losses or ranges of loss \nare probable and reasonably estimable. We also accrue litigation \nprovisions for the estimated fees and expenses of external law-\nyers and other service providers in relation to such proceedings, \nincluding in cases for which we have not accrued a loss contin-\ngency provision. We accrue these fee and expense litigation pro-\nvisions and take a charge to income in connection therewith when \nsuch fees and expenses are probable and reasonably estimable. \nWe review our legal proceedings each quarter to determine the \nadequacy of our litigation provisions and may increase or release \nprovisions based on management\xe2\x80\x99s judgment and the advice of \ncounsel. The establishment of additional provisions or releases of \n\nCritical accounting estimates\n\n107\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nlitigation provisions may be necessary in the future as develop-\nments in such proceedings warrant.\n\nIt is inherently difficult to determine whether a loss is probable or \neven reasonably possible or to estimate the amount of any loss or \nloss range for many of our legal proceedings. Estimates, by their \nnature, are based on judgment and currently available informa-\ntion and involve a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, \nthe type and nature of the proceeding, the progress of the matter, \nthe advice of counsel, our defenses and our experience in similar \nmatters, as well as our assessment of matters, including settle-\nments, involving other defendants in similar or related cases or \nproceedings. Factual and legal determinations, many of which are \ncomplex, must be made before a loss, additional losses or ranges \nof loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding. We do \nnot believe that we can estimate an aggregate range of reason-\nably possible losses for certain of our proceedings because of \ntheir complexity, the novelty of some of the claims, the early \nstage of the proceedings, the limited amount of discovery that \nhas occurred and/or other factors. Most matters pending against \nus seek damages of an indeterminate amount. While certain mat-\nters specify the damages claimed, such claimed amount may not \nrepresent our reasonably possible losses.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cNote 39 \xe2\x80\x93 Litigation\xe2\x80\x9d in VI \xe2\x80\x93 Consolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 \n\nCredit Suisse Group for further information on legal proceedings.\n\nAllowance and provision for credit losses\nAs a normal part of our business, we are exposed to credit \nrisk through our lending relationships, commitments and let-\nters of credit as well as counterparty risk on derivatives, foreign \nexchange and other transactions. Credit risk is the possibility of a \nloss being incurred as a result of a borrower or counterparty fail-\ning to meet its financial obligations or as a result of deterioration \nin the credit quality of the borrower or counterparty. In the event \nof a default, we generally incur a loss equal to the amount owed \nby the debtor, less any recoveries resulting from foreclosure, liq-\nuidation of collateral or the restructuring of the debtor company. \nThe allowance for loan losses is considered a reasonable esti-\nmate of credit losses existing at the dates of the consolidated bal-\nance sheets. This allowance is for probable credit losses inherent \nin existing exposures and credit exposures specifically identified \nas impaired.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cNote 1 \xe2\x80\x93 Summary of significant accounting policies\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cNote \n\n19 \xe2\x80\x93 Loans, allowance for loan losses and credit quality\xe2\x80\x9d in VI \xe2\x80\x93 Consolidated \nfinancial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group for further information on allowance \nfor loan losses.\n\nthe inherent loan loss allowance for loan portfolios in our invest-\nment banking businesses uses rating-specific default probabili-\nties, which incorporate not only historic third-party data but also \ndata implied from current quoted credit spreads.\n\nMany factors are evaluated in estimating probable credit losses \ninherent in existing exposures. These factors include: the volatil-\nity of default probabilities; rating changes; the magnitude of the \npotential loss; internal risk ratings; geographic, industry and other \neconomic factors; and imprecision in the methodologies and mod-\nels used to estimate credit risk. Overall credit risk indicators are \nalso considered, such as trends in internal risk-rated exposures, \nclassified exposures, cash-basis loans, recent loss experience \nand forecasted write-offs, as well as industry and geographic \nconcentrations and current developments within those segments \nor locations. Our current business strategy and credit process, \nincluding credit approvals and limits, underwriting criteria and \nworkout procedures, are also important factors.\n\nSignificant judgment is exercised in the evaluation of these \nfactors. For example, estimating the amount of potential loss \nrequires an assessment of the period of the underlying data. Data \nthat does not capture a complete credit cycle may compromise \nthe accuracy of loss estimates. Determining which external data \nrelating to default probabilities should be used and when it should \nbe used also requires judgment. The use of market indices and \nratings that do not sufficiently correlate to our specific exposure \ncharacteristics could also affect the accuracy of loss estimates. \nEvaluating the impact of uncertainties regarding macroeconomic \nand political conditions, currency devaluations on cross-border \nexposures, changes in underwriting criteria, unexpected correla-\ntions among exposures and other factors all require significant \njudgment. Changes in our estimates of probable loan losses \ninherent in the portfolio could have an impact on the provision and \nresult in a change in the allowance.\n\nSpecific loan loss allowances\nWe make provisions for specific loan losses on impaired loans \nbased on regular and detailed analysis of each loan in the port-\nfolio. This analysis includes an estimate of the realizable value of \nany collateral, the costs associated with obtaining repayment and \nrealization of any such collateral, the counterparty\xe2\x80\x99s overall finan-\ncial condition, resources and payment record, the extent of our \nother commitments to the same counterparty and prospects for \nsupport from any financially responsible guarantors.\n\nInherent loan loss allowance\nThe inherent loan loss allowance is for all credit exposures not \nspecifically identified as impaired and that, on a portfolio basis, \nare considered to contain probable inherent loss. The estimate \nof this component of the allowance for the consumer loans port-\nfolio involves applying historical and current default probabilities, \nhistorical recovery experience and related current assumptions to \nhomogenous loans based on internal risk rating and product type. \nTo estimate this component of the allowance for the corporate \nand institutional loans portfolio, the Group segregates loans by \nrisk, industry or country rating. The methodology for determining \n\nThe methodology for calculating specific allowances involves \njudgments at many levels. First, it involves the early identification \nof deteriorating credit. Extensive judgment is required in order to \nproperly evaluate the various indicators of the financial condi-\ntion of a counterparty and likelihood of repayment. The failure \nto identify certain indicators or give them proper weight could \nlead to a different conclusion about the credit risk. The assess-\nment of credit risk is subject to inherent limitations with respect \nto the completeness and accuracy of relevant information (for \nexample, relating to the counterparty, collateral or guarantee) that \nis available at the time of the assessment. Significant judgment is \n\n108\n\nCritical accounting estimates\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nexercised in determining the amount of the allowance. Whenever \npossible, independent, verifiable data or our own historical loss \nexperience is used in models for estimating loan losses. How-\never, a significant degree of uncertainty remains when applying \nsuch valuation techniques. Under our loan policy, the classifica-\ntion of loan status also has a significant impact on the subsequent \naccounting for interest accruals.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cRisk Management\xe2\x80\x9d in III \xe2\x80\x93 Treasury, Risk, Balance sheet and Off-bal-\nance sheet and \xe2\x80\x9cNote 19 \xe2\x80\x93 Loans, allowance for loan losses and credit quality\xe2\x80\x9d \nin VI \xe2\x80\x93 Consolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group for loan port-\nfolio disclosures, valuation adjustment disclosures and certain other information \nrelevant to the evaluation of credit risk and credit risk management.\n\ndifference between the carrying value and the fair value of the \nreporting unit up to a maximum of the goodwill amount recorded \nin that reporting unit.\n\nThe qualitative assessment is intended to be a simplification of \nthe annual impairment test and can be bypassed for any reporting \nunit and any period to proceed directly to performing the quan-\ntitative goodwill impairment test. When bypassing the qualitative \nassessment in any period in accordance with the current practice \nof the Group, the preparation of a qualitative assessment can be \nresumed in any subsequent period.\n\nGoodwill impairment\n\nUnder US GAAP, goodwill is not amortized, but is reviewed for \npotential impairment on an annual basis as of December\xc2\xa031 and \nat any other time that events or circumstances indicate that the \ncarrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable.\n\nFor the purpose of testing goodwill for impairment, each reporting \nunit is assessed individually. A reporting unit is an operating seg-\nment or one level below an operating segment, also referred to as \na component. A component of an operating segment is deemed \nto be a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for \nwhich discrete financial information is available and management \nregularly reviews the operating results of that component.\n\nThe Group\xe2\x80\x99s reporting units are defined as follows: Swiss Univer-\nsal Bank \xe2\x80\x93 Private Clients, Swiss Universal Bank \xe2\x80\x93 Corporate & \nInstitutional Clients, International Wealth Management \xe2\x80\x93 Private \nBanking, International Wealth Management \xe2\x80\x93 Asset Manage-\nment, Asia Pacific \xe2\x80\x93 Wealth Management & Connected, Asia \nPacific \xe2\x80\x93 Markets, Global Markets, Investment Banking & Capital \nMarkets and the Strategic Resolution Unit.\n\nIn accordance with US GAAP, the Group continually assesses \nwhether or not there has been a triggering event requiring a \nreview of goodwill. The Group determined in 2018 that a goodwill \ntriggering event occurred for the Asia Pacific \xe2\x80\x93 Markets, Global \nMarkets and Investment Banking & Capital Markets reporting \nunits.\n\nUnder Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2011-08, \xe2\x80\x9cTesting \nGoodwill for Impairment\xe2\x80\x9d, a qualitative assessment is permitted \nto evaluate whether a reporting unit\xe2\x80\x99s fair value is less than its \ncarrying value. If on the basis of the qualitative assessment it is \nmore likely than not that the reporting unit\xe2\x80\x99s fair value is higher \nthan its carrying value, no quantitative goodwill impairment test is \nrequired. If on the basis of the qualitative assessment it is more \nlikely than not that the reporting unit\xe2\x80\x99s fair value is lower than its \ncarrying value, a quantitative goodwill impairment test must be \nperformed, by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and \ncomparing that amount to its carrying value. If the fair value of \na reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, there is no goodwill \nimpairment. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, there is a \ngoodwill impairment. The goodwill impairment is calculated as the \n\nCircumstances that could trigger an initial qualitative assessment \nof the goodwill impairment test include, but are not limited to: (i) \nmacroeconomic conditions such as a deterioration in general eco-\nnomic conditions or other developments in equity and credit mar-\nkets; (ii) industry and market considerations such as a deteriora-\ntion in the environment in which the entity operates, an increased \ncompetitive environment, a decline in market-dependent multiples \nor metrics (considered in both absolute terms and relative to \npeers), and regulatory or political developments; (iii) other rel-\nevant entity-specific events such as changes in management, \nkey personnel or strategy; (iv) a more-likely-than-not expecta-\ntion of selling or disposing of all, or a portion, of a reporting unit; \n(v) results of testing for recoverability of a significant asset group \nwithin a reporting unit; (vi) recognition of a goodwill impairment in \nthe financial statements of a subsidiary that is a component of a \nreporting unit; and (vii) a sustained decrease in share price (con-\nsidered in both absolute terms and relative to peers).\n\nThe carrying value of each reporting unit for the purpose of the \ngoodwill impairment test is determined by considering the report-\ning units\xe2\x80\x99 risk-weighted assets usage, leverage ratio exposure, \ndeferred tax assets, goodwill and intangible assets. Any residual \nequity, after considering the total of these elements, is allocated \nto the reporting units on a pro-rata basis. As of December\xc2\xa031, \n2018, such residual equity was equal to CHF\xc2\xa0809 million.\n\nIn estimating the fair value of its reporting units, the Group \napplied a combination of the market approach and the income \napproach. Under the market approach, consideration was given \nto price to projected earnings multiples or price to book value \nmultiples for similarly traded companies and prices paid in recent \ntransactions that have occurred in its industry or in related indus-\ntries. Under the income approach, a discount rate was applied \nthat reflects the risk and uncertainty related to the reporting unit\xe2\x80\x99s \nprojected cash flows, which were determined from the Group\xe2\x80\x99s \nfinancial plan.\n\nIn determining the estimated fair value, the Group relied upon its \nlatest five-year strategic business plan, which included significant \nmanagement assumptions and estimates based on its view of \ncurrent and future economic conditions and regulatory changes, \nand as approved by the Board of Directors.\n\nEstimates of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s future earnings potential, and that of \nthe reporting units, involve considerable judgment, including \n\nCritical accounting estimates\n\n109\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nmanagement\xe2\x80\x99s view on future changes in market cycles, the reg-\nulatory environment and the anti cipated result of the implementa-\ntion of business strategies, competitive factors and assumptions \nconcerning the retention of key employees. Adverse changes in \nthe estimates and assumptions used to determine the fair value of \nthe Group\xe2\x80\x99s reporting units may result in a goodwill impairment in \nthe future.\n\nAn estimated balance sheet for each reporting unit is prepared \non a quarterly basis. In January 2017, the Financial Accounting \nStandards Board issued ASU\xc2\xa02017-04 \xe2\x80\x9cSimplifying the Test for \nGoodwill Impairment\xe2\x80\x9d (ASU\xc2\xa02017-04). The guidance removed step \ntwo of the goodwill impairment test, which required a hypotheti-\ncal purchase price allocation. A goodwill impairment is now defined \nas the amount by which a reporting unit\xe2\x80\x99s carrying value exceeds \nits fair value. An impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount \nequal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allo-\ncated to that reporting unit. Credit Suisse has decided to early \nadopt ASU\xc2\xa02017-04, simplifying the test for goodwill impairment \nas of January 1, 2017. This policy has also been early adopted for \nany goodwill impairment tests performed for any subsidiary of the \nGroup.\n\nBased on its goodwill impairment analysis performed as of \nDecember\xc2\xa031, 2018, the Group concluded that the estimated \nfair value for all of the reporting units with goodwill substantially \nexceeded their related carrying values and no impairment was \nnecessary as of December\xc2\xa031, 2018.\n\nThe Group engaged the services of an independent valuation \nspecialist to assist in the valuation of the Asia Pacific \xe2\x80\x93 Mar-\nkets, Global Markets and Investment Banking & Capital Markets \nreporting units as of December\xc2\xa031, 2018. The valuations were \nperformed using a combination of the market approach and \nincome approach.\n\nThe results of the impairment evaluation of each reporting unit\xe2\x80\x99s \ngoodwill would be significantly impacted by adverse changes \nin the underlying parameters used in the valuation process. If \nactual outcomes adversely differ by a significant margin from our \nbest estimates of the key economic assumptions and associated \ncash flows applied in the valuation of the reporting unit, we could \npotentially incur material impairment charges in the future.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cNote 21 \xe2\x80\x93 Goodwill\xe2\x80\x9d in VI \xe2\x80\x93 Consolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 \n\nCredit Suisse Group for further information on goodwill.\n\nTaxes\n\nUncertainty of income tax positions\nWe follow the income tax guidance under US GAAP, which sets \nout a consistent framework to determine the appropriate level of \ntax reserves to maintain for uncertain income tax positions.\n\nSignificant judgment is required in determining whether it is more \nlikely than not that an income tax position will be sustained upon \n\n110\n\nCritical accounting estimates\n\nexamination, including resolution of any related appeals or litiga-\ntion processes, based on the technical merits of the position. \nFurther judgment is required to determine the amount of benefit \neligible for recognition in the consolidated financial statements. \n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cNote 28 \xe2\x80\x93 Tax\xe2\x80\x9d in VI \xe2\x80\x93 Consolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit \n\nSuisse Group for further information on income tax positions.\n\nDeferred tax valuation allowances\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the esti-\nmated future tax effects of operating loss carry-forwards and \ntemporary differences between the carrying values of existing \nassets and liabilities and their respective tax bases at the dates of \nthe consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe realization of deferred tax assets on temporary differences \nis dependent upon the generation of taxable income during the \nperiods in which those temporary differences become deduct-\nible. The realization of deferred tax assets on net operating losses \nis dependent upon the generation of taxable income during the \nperiods prior to their expiration, if applicable. Management regu-\nlarly evaluates whether deferred tax assets will be realized. If \nmanagement considers it more likely than not that all or a portion \nof a deferred tax asset will not be realized, a corresponding valu-\nation allowance is established. In evaluating whether deferred tax \nassets will be realized, management considers both positive and \nnegative evidence, including projected future taxable income, the \nreversal of deferred tax liabilities which can be scheduled and tax \nplanning strategies.\n\nThis evaluation requires significant management judgment, pri-\nmarily with respect to projected taxable income. Future taxable \nincome can never be predicted with certainty. It is derived from \nbudgets and strategic business plans but is dependent on numer-\nous factors, some of which are beyond management\xe2\x80\x99s control. \nSubstantial variance of actual results from estimated future tax-\nable profits, or changes in our estimate of future taxable profits \nand potential restructurings, could lead to changes in deferred \ntax assets being realizable, or considered realizable, and would \nrequire a corresponding adjustment to the valuation allowance.\n\nAs part of its normal practice, management has conducted a \ndetailed evaluation of its expected future results and also consid-\nered stress scenarios. This evaluation has indicated the expected \nfuture results that are likely to be earned in jurisdictions where \nthe Group has significant gross deferred tax assets, such as the \nUS, Switzerland and the UK. Management then compared those \nexpected future results with the applicable law governing utiliza-\ntion of deferred tax assets. Swiss tax law allows for a seven-year \ncarry-forward period for net operating losses. UK tax law allows \nfor an unlimited carry-forward period for net operating losses, and \neven though there are restrictions on the use of tax losses carried \nforward, these are not expected to have a material impact on the \nrecoverability of the net deferred tax assets. US tax law allows for \na 20-year carry-forward period for existing net operating losses. \nDue to the US tax reform enacted on December 22, 2017, this \n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nperiod limitation was removed and any new net operating losses \nwill have an unlimited carry-forward period.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cNote 28 \xe2\x80\x93 Tax\xe2\x80\x9d in VI \xe2\x80\x93 Consolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit \n\nSuisse Group for further information on deferred tax assets.\n\nPension plans\n\nThe Group\nThe Group covers pension requirements, in both Swiss and non-\nSwiss locations, through various defined benefit pension plans \nand defined contribution pension plans.\n\nOur funding policy with respect to these pension plans is consis-\ntent with local government and tax requirements.\n\nThe calculation of the expense and liability associated with \nthe defined benefit pension plans requires an extensive use of \nassumptions, which include the discount rate, expected return on \nplan assets and rate of future compensation increases. Manage-\nment determines these assumptions based upon currently avail-\nable market and industry data and historical experience of the \nplans. Management also consults with an independent actuarial \nfirm to assist in selecting appropriate assumptions and valuing \nits related liabilities. Management regularly reviews the actuarial \nassumptions used to value and measure the defined benefit obli-\ngation on a periodic basis as required by US GAAP. The actuarial \nassumptions that we use may differ materially from actual results \ndue to changing market and economic conditions and specific \nexperience of the plans (such as investment management over or \nunderperformance, higher or lower withdrawal rates and longer \nor shorter life spans of the participants). Any such differences \ncould have a significant impact on the amount of pension expense \nrecorded in future years.\n\nThe funded status of our defined benefit pension and other post-\nretirement defined benefit plans is recorded in the consolidated \nbalance sheets. The impacts from re-measuring the funded sta-\ntus (reflected in actuarial gains or losses) and from amending the \nplan (reflected in prior service cost or credits) are recognized in \nequity as a component of AOCI.\n\nThe projected benefit obligation (PBO) of our total defined ben-\nefit pension plans included CHF\xc2\xa0928 million and CHF\xc2\xa01,083 \nmillion related to our assumption for future salary increases as \nof December\xc2\xa031, 2018 and 2017. The accumulated benefit obli-\ngation (ABO) is defined as the PBO less the amount related to \nestimated future salary increases. The difference between the \nfair value of plan assets and the ABO was an overfunding of \nCHF\xc2\xa02,374 million for 2018, compared to CHF\xc2\xa02,892 million for \n2017.\n\nWe are required to estimate the expected long-term rate of return \non plan assets, which is then used to compute benefit costs \nrecorded in the consolidated statements of operations. Estimat-\ning future returns on plan assets is particularly subjective, as \n\nthe estimate requires an assessment of possible future mar-\nket returns based on the plan asset mix. In calculating pension \nexpense and in determining the expected long-term rate of return, \nwe use the market-related value of assets. The assumptions used \nto determine the benefit obligation as of the measurement date \nare also used to calculate the net periodic benefit costs for the \n12-month period following this date.\n\nThe expected weighted-average long-term rate of return used to \ndetermine the expected return on plan assets as a component \nof the net periodic benefit costs in 2018 and 2017 was 3.00% \nand 3.00%, respectively, for the Swiss plans and 3.22% and \n3.88%, respectively, for the international plans. In 2018, if the \nexpected long-term rate of return had been increased/decreased \none percentage point, net pension expense for the Swiss plans \nwould have decreased/increased CHF\xc2\xa0161 million and net pen-\nsion expense for the international plans would have decreased/\nincreased CHF\xc2\xa035 million.\n\nThe discount rates used in determining the benefit obligation and \nthe pension expense are based on yield curves, constructed from \nhigh-quality corporate bonds currently available and observable \nin the market and are expected to be available during the period \nto maturity of the pension benefits. In countries where there is \nno deep market in high-quality corporate bonds with longer dura-\ntions, the best available market information, including governmen-\ntal bond yields and risk premiums, is used to construct the yield \ncurve. Credit Suisse uses the spot rate approach for determining \nthe benefit obligation and for service and interest cost compo-\nnents of the pension expense for future years. Under the spot \nrate approach, individual spot rates along the yield curve are \napplied to each expected future benefit payment, whereas under \nthe previous methodology a single weighted-average discount \nrate derived from the yield curve was applied.\n\nFor the Swiss plan, the weighted average discount rate for \nthe PBO increased 0.17 percentage points, from 0.86% as \nof December\xc2\xa031, 2017 to 1.03% as of December\xc2\xa031, 2018, \nmainly due to an increase in Swiss bond market rates. The \naverage discount rate for the PBO for the international plans \nincreased 0.47 percentage points, from 2.83% as of Decem-\nber\xc2\xa031, 2017 to 3.30% as of December\xc2\xa031, 2018, mainly due to \nan increase in bond market rates. For the year ended Decem-\nber\xc2\xa031, 2018, a one percentage point decline in the discount \nrates for the Swiss plans would have resulted in an increase \nin the PBO of CHF\xc2\xa01,634 million and an increase in pension \nexpense of CHF\xc2\xa050 million, and a one percentage point increase \nin discount rates would have resulted in a decrease in the PBO \nof CHF\xc2\xa01,341 million and a decrease in the pension expense of \nCHF\xc2\xa069 million. A one percentage point decline in discount rates \nfor the international plans as of December\xc2\xa031, 2018 would have \nresulted in an increase in the PBO of CHF\xc2\xa0613 million and an \nincrease in pension expense of CHF\xc2\xa058 million, and a one per-\ncentage point increase in discount rates would have resulted in a \ndecrease in the PBO of CHF\xc2\xa0470 million and a decrease in the \npension expense of CHF\xc2\xa027 million.\n\nCritical accounting estimates\n\n111\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nActuarial losses and prior service cost are amortized over the \naverage remaining service period of active employees expected to \nreceive benefits under the plan, which, as of December\xc2\xa031, 2018, \nwas approximately 10 years for the Swiss plans and 3 to 20 years \nfor the international plans. The pre-tax expense associated with \nthe amortization of net actuarial losses and prior service cost for \ndefined benefit pension plans for the years ended December\xc2\xa031, \n2018, 2017 and 2016 was CHF\xc2\xa0227 million, CHF\xc2\xa0269 million \nand CHF\xc2\xa0291 million, respectively. The amortization of recognized \nactuarial losses and prior service cost for defined benefit pension \nplans for the year ending December\xc2\xa031, 2019, which is assessed \nat the beginning of the year, is expected to be CHF\xc2\xa0116 million, \nnet of tax. The impact from deviations between our actuarial \nassumptions and the actual developments of such parameters \nobserved for our pension plans further impacts the amount of net \nactuarial losses or gains recognized in equity, resulting in a higher \nor lower amount of amortization expense in periods after 2019.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cNote 31 \xe2\x80\x93 Pension and other post-retirement benefits\xe2\x80\x9d in VI \xe2\x80\x93 Con-\nsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group for further information.\n\nThe Bank\nThe Bank covers pension requirements for its employees in Swit-\nzerland through participation in a defined benefit pension plan \nsponsored by the Group (Group plan). Various legal entities within \nthe Group participate in the Group plan, which is set up as an \nindependent trust domiciled in Zurich. The Group accounts for \nthe Group plan as a single-employer defined benefit pension plan \nand uses the projected unit credit actuarial method to determine \nthe net periodic pension expense, PBO, ABO and the related \namounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. The \nfunded status of the Group plan is recorded in the consolidated \nbalance sheets. The actuarial gains and losses and prior service \ncosts or credits are recognized in equity as a component of AOCI.\n\nThe Bank accounts for the Group plan on a defined contribution \nbasis whereby it only recognizes the amounts required to be con-\ntributed to the Group plan during the period as net periodic pen-\nsion expense and only recognizes a liability for any contributions \ndue and unpaid. No other expense or balance sheet amounts \nrelated to the Group plan are recognized by the Bank.\n\nThe Bank covers pension requirements for its employees in inter-\nnational locations through participation in various pension plans, \nwhich are accounted for as single-employer defined benefit pen-\nsion plans or defined contribution pension plans.\n\nIn 2018 and 2017, the weighted-average expected long-term rate \nof return used to calculate the expected return on plan assets as \na component of the net periodic benefit costs for the interna-\ntional single-employer defined benefit pension plans was 3.22% \nand 3.88%, respectively. In 2018, if the expected long-term rate \nof return had been increased/decreased one percentage point, \nnet pension expense would have decreased/increased CHF\xc2\xa035 \nmillion.\n\nThe discount rate used in determining the benefit obligation is \nbased either on high-quality corporate bond rates or government \nbond rates plus a premium in order to approximate high-quality \ncorporate bond rates. The average discount rate for the PBO for \nthe international plans increased 0.47 percentage points, from \n2.83% as of December 31, 2017 to 3.30% as of December 31, \n2018. A one percentage point decline in the discount rate for \nthe international single-employer plans would have resulted in an \nincrease in PBO of CHF\xc2\xa0613 million and an increase in pension \nexpense of CHF\xc2\xa058 million, and a one percentage point increase \nin discount rates would have resulted in a decrease in PBO of \nCHF\xc2\xa0470 million and a decrease in pension expense of CHF\xc2\xa027 \nmillion.\n\nActuarial losses and prior service cost related to the international \nsingle-employer defined benefit pension plans are amortized \nover the average remaining service period of active employees \nexpected to receive benefits under the plan.

The \nmajority of our unsecured funding was generated from core customer \ndeposits and long-term debt.\n\nLiquidity management\n\nRegulatory framework \n\nSecurities for funding and capital purposes have historically been \nissued primarily by the Bank, our principal operating subsidiary \nand a US registrant. In response to regulatory reform, we have \nfocused our issuance strategy on offering long-term debt securi-\nties at the Group level. Proceeds from issuances are lent to oper-\nating subsidiaries and affiliates on both a senior and subordinated \nbasis, as needed; the latter typically to meet capital requirements \nand the former as desired by management to support business \ninitiatives and liquidity needs. \n\nBIS liquidity framework\nIn 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) \nissued the Basel III international framework for liquidity risk mea-\nsurement, standards and monitoring. The Basel III framework \nincludes a liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and a net stable funding \nratio (NSFR). Credit Suisse is subject to the Basel III frame-\nwork, as implemented in Switzerland, as well as Swiss legisla-\ntion and regulations for systemically important banks (Swiss \nRequirements).\n\nOur liquidity and funding strategy is approved by the Capital \nAllocation & Risk Management Committee (CARMC) and over-\nseen by the Board of Directors (Board). The implementation and \nexecution of the liquidity and funding strategy is managed within \nthe CFO division by Treasury and our global liquidity group. The \nglobal liquidity group was established in the second quarter of \n2018 to centralize control of liability and collateral management \nwith the aim of optimizing our liquidity sourcing, funding costs and \nhigh-quality liquid assets (HQLA) portfolio on behalf of Treasury. \nTreasury ensures adherence to our funding policy and the global \nliquidity group is focused on the efficient coordination of the \nshort-term unsecured and secured funding desks. This approach \nenhances our ability to manage potential liquidity and funding \nrisks and to promptly adjust our liquidity and funding levels to \nmeet stress situations. Our liquidity and funding profile is regularly \nreported to CARMC and the Board, who define our risk tolerance, \nincluding liquidity risk, and set parameters for the balance sheet \nand funding usage of our businesses. The Board is responsible \nfor defining our overall risk tolerance in the form of a risk appetite \nstatement.\n\nOur liquidity and funding profile reflects our strategy and risk \nappetite and is driven by business activity levels and the overall \noperating environment. We have adapted our liquidity and fund-\ning profile to reflect lessons learned from the financial crisis, the \nsubsequent changes in our business strategy and regulatory \ndevelopments. We have been an active participant in regulatory \nand industry forums to promote best practice standards on quan-\ntitative and qualitative liquidity management. Our internal liquidity \nrisk management framework is subject to review and monitor-\ning by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA \n(FINMA), other regulators and rating agencies.\n\nThe LCR, which was phased in from January 1, 2015 through \nJanuary 1, 2019, addresses liquidity risk over a 30-day period. \nThe LCR aims to ensure that banks have unencumbered HQLA \navailable to meet short-term liquidity needs under a severe stress \nscenario. The LCR is comprised of two components, the value \nof HQLA in stressed conditions and the total net cash outflows \ncalculated according to specified scenario parameters. Under the \nBCBS requirements, the ratio of liquid assets over net cash out-\nflows was subject to an initial minimum requirement of 60% as \nof January 1, 2015, which was increased by 10% per year and is \ncurrently at 100% since January 1, 2019. \n\nThe NSFR establishes criteria for a minimum amount of stable \nfunding based on the liquidity of a bank\xe2\x80\x99s on- and off-balance \nsheet activities over a one-year horizon. The NSFR is a comple-\nmentary measure to the LCR and is structured to ensure that \nilliquid assets are funded with an appropriate amount of stable \nlong-term funds. The NSFR is defined as the ratio of available \nstable funding over the amount of required stable funding and \nonce implemented by national regulators, should always be at \nleast 100%.\n\nSwiss liquidity requirements\nIn 2012, the Swiss Federal Council adopted a liquidity ordinance \n(Liquidity Ordinance) that implements Basel III liquidity require-\nments into Swiss law subject, in part, to further rule-making, \nincluding with respect to the final Basel III LCR rules adopted \nin 2014. Effective January 1, 2018, the Swiss Federal Coun-\ncil amended the Liquidity Ordinance with minor adjustments to \nthe LCR and relief for smaller banks. The amendments were \nnot material to the LCR for the Group and relevant subsidiaries. \nUnder the Liquidity Ordinance, as amended, certain Swiss banks \nbecame subject to an initial 60% LCR requirement, with incre-\nmental increases by 10% per year until January 1, 2019. Sys-\ntemically relevant banks like Credit Suisse became subject to an \ninitial minimum LCR requirement of 100% at all times beginning \non January 1, 2015 and the associated disclosure requirements. \n\n114\n\nLiquidity and funding management\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nIn May 2015, FINMA required us to maintain a higher minimum \nLCR of 110%; in June 2018 this was lowered to the minimum \nrequirement of 100%. \n\nIn connection with the implementation of Basel III, regulatory LCR \ndisclosures for the Group and certain subsidiaries are required. \nFurther details on our LCR can be found on our website.\n > Refer to credit-suisse.com/regulatorydisclosures for additional information.\n\nFINMA requires us to report the NSFR to FINMA on a monthly \nbasis during an observation period that began in 2012. The \nreporting instructions are generally aligned with the final BCBS \nNSFR requirements. In November 2017, the Federal Council \ndecided to postpone the introduction of the NSFR as a minimum \nstandard, which was originally planned for January 1, 2018. In \nNovember 2018, the Federal Council decided to postpone the \nintroduction of the NSFR again and will reconsider this matter at \nthe end of 2019.\n\nOur liquidity principles and our liquidity risk management frame-\nwork as agreed with FINMA are in line with the Basel III liquidity \nframework.\n\nLiquidity risk management \n\nOur approach to liquidity risk management \nOur liquidity and funding policy is designed to ensure that fund-\ning is available to meet all obligations in times of stress, whether \ncaused by market events or issues specific to Credit Suisse. \nWe achieve this through a conservative asset/liability manage-\nment strategy aimed at maintaining long-term funding, including \nstable deposits, in excess of illiquid assets. To address short-term \nliquidity stress, we maintain a liquidity pool, described below, that \ncovers unexpected outflows in the event of severe market and \nidiosyncratic stress. Our liquidity risk parameters reflect various \nliquidity stress assumptions that we believe are conservative. We \nmanage our liquidity profile at a sufficient level such that, in the \nevent we are unable to access unsecured funding, we expect to \nhave sufficient liquidity to sustain operations for a period of time \nin excess of our minimum limit. This includes potential currency \nmismatches, which are not deemed to be a major risk but are \nmonitored and subject to limits, particularly in the significant cur-\nrencies of euro, Japanese yen, pound sterling, Swiss franc and \nUS dollar.\n\nAlthough the compliance with a minimum NSFR is not yet \nrequired, we began using the NSFR in 2012 as one of our pri-\nmary tools, in parallel with the internal liquidity barometer, and in \n2014 the LCR, to monitor our structural liquidity position and plan \nfunding. \n\nWe use our internal liquidity barometer to manage liquidity to \ninternal targets and as a basis to model both Credit Suisse-\nspecific and market-wide stress scenarios and their impact on \nliquidity and funding. Our internal barometer framework supports \nthe management of our funding structure. It allows us to man-\nage the time horizon over which the stressed market value of \n\nunencumbered assets (including cash) exceeds the aggregate \nvalue of contractual outflows of unsecured liabilities plus a con-\nservative forecast of anticipated contingent commitments. This \ninternal barometer framework enables us to manage liquidity to \na desired profile under a Credit Suisse-specific or market-wide \nstress that permits us to continue business activities for a period \nof time (also known as a liquidity horizon) without changing busi-\nness plans. Under this framework, we also have short-term tar-\ngets based on additional stress scenarios to ensure uninterrupted \nliquidity for short time frames. At the beginning of 2017, we \nintroduced a new version of our internal liquidity barometer, which \nincludes enhanced functionalities to manage entity-specific liquid-\nity under newly defined and more conservative stress scenarios \nfor redefined short and long-term time horizons.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2014, we began allocating the major-\nity of the balance sheet usage related to our Treasury-managed \nHQLA portfolio to the business divisions to allow for a more \nefficient management of their business activities from an over-\nall Group perspective with respect to LCR and Swiss leverage \nrequirements.\n\nOur overall liquidity management framework allows us to run \nstress analyses on our balance sheet and off-balance sheet posi-\ntions, which include, but are not limited to, the following:\np  A multiple-notch downgrade in the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s long-term debt \ncredit ratings, which would require additional funding as a \nresult of certain contingent off-balance sheet obligations;\n\np  Significant withdrawals from private banking client deposits;\np  Potential cash outflows associated with the prime brokerage \n\nbusiness;\n\np  Over-collateralization of available secured funding;\np  Limited availability of capital markets, certificates of deposit \n\nand commercial paper; \n\np  Other money market access will be significantly reduced;\np  A reduction in funding value of unencumbered assets;\np  The inaccessibility of assets held by subsidiaries due to regula-\n\ntory, operational and other constraints;\n\np  The possibility of providing non-contractual liquidity support in \n\ntimes of market stress, including purchasing our unsecured debt;\np  Monitoring the concentration in sources of wholesale funding \n\nand thus encourage funding diversification;\n\np  Monitoring the composition and analysis of the unencumbered \n\nassets;\n\np  Restricted availability of foreign currency swap markets; and\np  Other scenarios as deemed necessary from time to time.\n\nGovernance \nFunding, liquidity, capital and our foreign exchange exposures in \nthe banking book are managed centrally by Treasury. Oversight of \nthese activities is provided by CARMC, a committee that includes \nthe chief executive officers (CEOs) of the Group and the divisions, \nthe Chief Financial Officer (CFO), the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), \nthe Chief Compliance and Regulatory Affairs Officer (CCRO), or \nthe Chief Compliance Officer since the organizational change on \nFebruary 26, 2019, and the Treasurer. \n\nLiquidity and funding management\n\n115\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nIt is CARMC\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility to review the capital position, balance \nsheet development, current and prospective funding, interest rate \nrisk and foreign exchange exposure and to define and monitor \nadherence to internal risk limits. CARMC regularly reviews the \nmethodology and assumptions of our liquidity risk management \nframework and determines the liquidity horizon to be maintained.\n\nAll liquidity stress tests are coordinated and overseen by the CRO \nto ensure a consistent and coordinated approach across all risk \ndisciplines.\n\nContingency funding planning \nIn the event of a liquidity crisis, our Contingency Funding Plan \nprovides for specific actions to be taken depending on the nature \nof the crisis. Our plan is designed to address ever-increasing \nliquidity and funding stresses and has pre-defined escalation lev-\nels aimed at maximizing the likelihood that we can take certain \nmeasures to address liquidity or funding shortfalls. In order to \nidentify a deteriorating liquidity situation, we monitor a set of regu-\nlatory and economic liquidity metrics while also seeking the views \nof our subject matter experts as well as senior management, who \nretain at all times the authority to take remedial actions promptly. \nIn all cases, the plan\xe2\x80\x99s primary objectives are to strengthen liquid-\nity (immediate), reduce funding needs (medium term) and assess \nrecovery options (longer term).\n\nLiquidity metrics\n\nLiquidity pool \nTreasury manages a sizeable portfolio of liquid assets, comprised \nof cash held at central banks and securities. A portion of the \nliquidity pool is generated through reverse repurchase agree-\nments with top-rated counterparties. We are mindful of potential \ncredit risk and therefore focus our liquidity holdings strategy on \ncash held at central banks and highly rated government bonds \nand on short-term reverse repurchase agreements. These gov-\nernment bonds are eligible as collateral for liquidity facilities with \nvarious central banks including the Swiss National Bank (SNB), \nthe US Federal Reserve (Fed), the European Central Bank \n(ECB) and the Bank of England. Our direct exposure on these \n\nbonds is limited to highly liquid, top-rated sovereign entities or \nfully guaranteed agencies of sovereign entities. The liquidity pool \nmay be used to meet the liquidity requirements of our operating \ncompanies.\n\nAll securities, including those obtained from reverse repurchase \nagreements, are subject to a stress level haircut in our barometer \nto reflect the risk that emergency funding may not be available at \nmarket value in a stress scenario. \n\nWe centrally manage this liquidity pool and hold it at our main \noperating entities. Holding securities in these entities ensures \nthat we can make liquidity and funding available to local entities in \nneed without delay.\n\nAs of December 31, 2018, our liquidity pool managed by \nTreasury and the global liquidity group had an HQLA value of \nCHF\xc2\xa0159.9\xc2\xa0billion. The liquidity pool consisted of CHF\xc2\xa085.5\xc2\xa0bil-\nlion of cash held at major central banks, primarily the SNB, the \nFed and the ECB, and CHF\xc2\xa074.4\xc2\xa0billion market value of securities \nissued by governments and government agencies, primarily from \nthe US, UK and France. \n\nIn addition to the liquidity portfolio, there is also a portfolio of \nunencumbered liquid assets managed by the global liquidity group \nand by various businesses, primarily in the Global Markets and \nAPAC divisions. These assets generally include high-grade bonds \nand highly liquid equity securities that form part of major indices. \nIn coordination with the businesses and the global liquidity group, \nTreasury can access these assets to generate liquidity if required. \n\nAs of December 31, 2018, the portfolio of liquid assets that is \nnot managed by Treasury had a market value of CHF\xc2\xa028.7\xc2\xa0bil-\nlion, consisting of CHF\xc2\xa09.9\xc2\xa0billion of high-grade bonds and \nCHF\xc2\xa018.8\xc2\xa0billion of highly liquid equity securities. Under our inter-\nnal model, an average stress-level haircut of 17% is applied to \nthese assets. The haircuts applied to these portfolios reflect our \nassessment of overall market risk at the time of measurement, \npotential monetization capacity taking into account increased hair-\ncuts, market volatility and the quality of the relevant securities. \n\nLiquidity pool \xe2\x80\x93 Group\n\n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \nend of\xc2\xa0 \n\nLiquid assets (CHF million) \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCash held at central banks\xc2\xa0 \nSecurities\xc2\xa0 \nLiquid assets\xc2\xa01 \n\n1 Reflects a pre-cancellation view.\n\n116\n\nLiquidity and funding management\n\n  \nSwiss   \nfranc   \n\n  \nUS   \ndollar   \n\n  \n   \nEuro   \n\n  \nOther   \ncurrencies   \n\n2018  \n   \nTotal   \n\n61,471   \n7,531   \n69,002   \n\n14,831   \n39,895   \n54,726   \n\n6,654   \n7,603   \n14,257   \n\n2,538   \n19,331   \n21,869   \n\n85,494   \n74,360   \n159,854   \n\n2017 \n \nTotal \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n96,594 \n66,778 \n163,372 \n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nLiquidity Coverage Ratio \nOur calculation methodology for the LCR is prescribed by FINMA \nand uses a three-month average that is measured using daily \ncalculations during the quarter. The FINMA calculation of HQLA \ntakes into account a cancellation mechanism (post-cancellation \nview) and is therefore not directly comparable to the assets pre-\nsented in the financial statements that could potentially be mon-\netized under a severe stress scenario. The cancellation mecha-\nnism effectively excludes the impact of certain secured financing \ntransactions from available HQLA and simultaneously adjusts the \nlevel of net cash outflows calculated. Application of the cancella-\ntion mechanism adjusts both the numerator and denominator of \nthe LCR calculation, meaning that the impact is mostly neutral on \nthe LCR itself. \n\nOur HQLA measurement methodology excludes potentially \neligible HQLA available for use by entities of the Group in cer-\ntain jurisdictions that may not be readily accessible for use by \nthe Group as a whole. These HQLA eligible amounts may be \nrestricted for reasons such as local regulatory requirements, \nincluding large exposure requirements, or other binding con-\nstraints that could limit the transferability to other Group entities in \nother jurisdictions.\n\nOn this basis, the level of our LCR was 184% as of the end of \n2018, a small decrease from 185% as of the end of 2017, rep-\nresenting an average HQLA of CHF\xc2\xa0161 billion and average net \ncash outflows of CHF\xc2\xa088 billion. The ratio reflects a conserva-\ntive liquidity position, including ensuring that the Group\xe2\x80\x99s branches \nand subsidiaries meet applicable local liquidity requirements.\n\nThe LCR ratio was stable compared to 2017, as a decrease in the \nlevel of HQLA was offset by a decrease in net cash outflows. The \nlower level of HQLA reflected a decrease in cash held at central \nbanks, partially offset by an increase in the amount of securities \nheld during the period. The decrease in net cash outflows was \nprimarily a result of decreased secured funding and lending activi-\nties and lower cash outflows from non-operational deposits within \nunsecured wholesale funding and from other contingent funding \nobligations. The decreases in net cash outflows were partially off-\nset by a decrease in cash inflows from fully performing exposures \nand higher unsecured wholesale funding outflows in unsecured \ndebt.\n\nThe spot balance of HQLA held on the last business day of 2018 \nwas CHF\xc2\xa0157.4\xc2\xa0billion, which was CHF\xc2\xa00.7 billion higher than the \nspot balance of HQLA held on the last business day of 2017.\n\nLiquidity coverage ratio \xe2\x80\x93 Group\n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \nend of\xc2\xa0 \n\nHigh-quality liquid assets (CHF million) \n \n \n \nHigh-quality liquid assets\xc2\xa03 \n\nCash outflows \n \n \n \nRetail deposits and deposits from small business customers\xc2\xa0 \nUnsecured wholesale funding\xc2\xa0 \nSecured wholesale funding\xc2\xa0 \nAdditional requirements\xc2\xa0 \nOther contractual funding obligations\xc2\xa0 \nOther contingent funding obligations\xc2\xa0 \nTotal cash outflows\xc2\xa0 \n\nCash inflows \n \n \n \nSecured lending\xc2\xa0 \nInflows from fully performing exposures\xc2\xa0 \nOther cash inflows\xc2\xa0 \nTotal cash inflows\xc2\xa0 \n\nLiquidity coverage ratio \n \n \n \nHigh-quality liquid assets (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \nNet cash outflows (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \nLiquidity coverage ratio (%)\xc2\xa0 \n\nCalculated using a three-month average, which is calculated on a daily basis.\n1 Calculated as outstanding balances maturing or callable within 30 days.\n2 Calculated after the application of haircuts for high-quality liquid assets or inflow and outflow rates.\n3 Consists of cash and eligible securities as prescribed by FINMA and reflects a post-cancellation view.\n\n   \n\n2018   \n\n2017 \nUnweighted    Weighted    Weighted \nvalue   2\n\nvalue   2 \n\nvalue   1 \n\n\xe2\x80\x93   \n\n161,231   \n\n159,648   \n219,615   \n\xe2\x80\x93   \n166,741   \n65,526   \n202,457   \n\xe2\x80\x93   \n\n20,765   \n89,065   \n54,879   \n36,921   \n65,526   \n5,391   \n272,547   \n\n131,204   \n67,514   \n67,273   \n265,991   \n\n85,678   \n31,785   \n67,273   \n184,736   \n\n\xe2\x80\x93   \n\xe2\x80\x93   \n\xe2\x80\x93   \n\n161,231   \n87,811   \n184   \n\n \n \n \n166,077 \n\n \n \n \n20,108 \n87,899 \n65,525 \n37,435 \n70,679 \n6,644 \n288,290 \n\n \n \n \n92,585 \n33,624 \n72,228 \n198,437 \n\n \n \n \n166,077 \n89,853 \n185 \n\nLiquidity and funding management\n\n117\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nFunding management\n\nTreasury is responsible for the development, execution and regu-\nlar updating of our funding plan. The plan reflects projected busi-\nness growth, development of the balance sheet, future funding \nneeds and maturity profiles as well as the effects of changing \nmarket and regulatory conditions.\n\nInterest expense on long-term debt, is monitored and managed \nrelative to certain indices, such as the London Interbank Offered \nRate (LIBOR) and Overnight Index Swap rate (OIS), that are rel-\nevant to the financial services industry. This approach to term \nfunding best reflects the sensitivity of both our liabilities and our \nassets to changes in interest rates. We are closely following the \ntransition of LIBOR and other reference rates globally and the \nimpact of this transition on our approach to funding management.\n\nWe continually manage the impact of funding spreads through \ncareful management of our liability mix and opportunistic issu-\nance of debt. The effect of funding spreads on interest expense \ndepends on many factors, including market conditions, product \ntype and the absolute level of the indices on which our funding is \nbased.\n\nWe diversify our long-term funding sources by issuing structured \nnotes, which are debt securities on which the return is linked to \ncommodities, stocks, indices or currencies or other assets. We \ngenerally hedge structured notes with positions in the underlying \nassets or derivatives. \n\nWe also use other collateralized financings, including repurchase \nagreements and securities lending agreements. The level of our \nrepurchase agreements fluctuates, reflecting market opportuni-\nties, client needs for highly liquid collateral, such as US treasuries \nand agency securities, and the impact of balance sheet and risk-\nweighted asset limits. In addition, matched book trades, under \nwhich securities are purchased under agreements to resell and \nare simultaneously sold under agreements to repurchase with \ncomparable maturities, earn spreads, are relatively risk free and \nare generally related to client activity.\n\nOur primary source of liquidity is funding through consolidated \nentities.\n\nFunding sources\nWe fund our balance sheet primarily through core customer \ndeposits, long-term debt, including structured notes, and share-\nholders\xe2\x80\x99 equity. We monitor the funding sources, including their \nconcentrations against certain limits, according to their counter-\nparty, currency, tenor, geography and maturity, and whether they \nare secured or unsecured. A substantial portion of our balance \nsheet is match funded and requires no unsecured funding. Match \nfunded balance sheet items consist of assets and liabilities with \nclose to equal liquidity durations and values so that the liquidity \nand funding generated or required by the positions are substan-\ntially equivalent. \n\n118\n\nLiquidity and funding management\n\nCash and due from banks and reverse repurchase agreements \nare highly liquid. A significant part of our assets, principally unen-\ncumbered trading assets that support the securities business, is \ncomprised of securities inventories and collateralized receivables \nthat fluctuate and are generally liquid. These liquid assets are \navailable to settle short-term liabilities.\n\nLoans, which comprise the largest component of our illiquid \nassets, are funded by our core customer deposits, with an excess \ncoverage of 18% as of the end of 2018, stable compared to \n2017, including a small increase in both loans and deposits. We \nfund other illiquid assets, including real estate, private equity and \nother long-term investments as well as the haircut for the illiquid \nportion of securities, with long-term debt and equity, in which we \ntry to maintain a substantial funding buffer.\n\nBalance sheet funding structure\nas of December 31, 2018 (CHF billion)\n\nReverse repurchase  \nagreements \n\n61\n\nEncumbered trading assets  32\n\nFunding-neutral  \nassets1 \n\n68\n\nMatch  \nfunded\n\nCash & due from banks \n\n101\n\nUnencumbered \nliquid assets3 \n\n119\n\n66 \n\n27 \n\n68 \n\n9 \n38 \n22 \n\nRepurchase  \nagreements\n\nShort positions\n\nFunding-neutral  \nliabilities1\n\nOther short-term liabilities2\nDue to banks\nShort-term borrowings\n\ntime \n\n107\n\n341 Deposits5\n\ndemand  137\n\n118%  \ncoverage\n\nsavings \n\n64\n\nfiduciary  33\n\nLoans4 \n\n288\n\nOther illiquid assets \n\n100\n\n154 \n\nLong-term debt\n\n44 \n\nTotal equity\n\nAssets \n\n769\n\n769 \n\nLiabilities and Equity\n\n1 Primarily includes brokerage receivables/payables, positive/negative replacement  values \n\nand cash collateral.\n\n2 Primarily includes excess of funding neutral liabilities  (brokerage payables) over cor-\n\nresponding assets.\n\n3 Primarily includes unencumbered trading assets, unencumbered investment securities \n\nand excess reverse repurchase agreements, after haircuts.\n\n4 Excludes loans with banks.\n5 Excludes due to banks and  certificates of deposit.\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nOur core customer deposits totaled CHF\xc2\xa0341\xc2\xa0billion as of the \nend of 2018, an increase compared to CHF\xc2\xa0327\xc2\xa0billion as of the \nend of 2017, reflecting an increase in the customer deposit base \nin the private banking and corporate & institutional banking busi-\nnesses in 2018. Core customer deposits are from clients with \nwhom we have a broad and longstanding relationship. Core cus-\ntomer deposits exclude deposits from banks and certificates of \ndeposit. We place a priority on maintaining and growing customer \ndeposits, as they have proven to be a stable and resilient source \nof funding even in difficult market conditions.

Our funds transfer pricing system is designed to \nallocate to our businesses all funding costs in a way that incen-\ntivizes their efficient use of funding. Our funds transfer pricing \nsystem is an essential tool that allocates to the businesses the \nshort-term and long-term costs of funding their balance sheet \n\nusages and off-balance sheet contingencies. The funds trans-\nfer pricing framework ensures full funding costs allocation under \nnormal business conditions, but it is of even greater importance \nin a stressed capital markets environment where raising funds \nis more challenging and expensive. Under this framework, our \nbusinesses are also credited to the extent they provide long-term \nstable funding.\n\nContractual maturity of assets and liabilities\nThe following table provides contractual maturities of the assets \nand liabilities specified as of the end of 2018. The contractual \nmaturities are an important source of information for liquidity risk \nmanagement. However, liquidity risk is also managed based on \nan expected maturity that considers counterparty behavior and in \naddition takes into account certain off-balance sheet items such \nas derivatives. Liquidity risk management performs extensive anal-\nysis of counterparty behavioral assumptions under various stress \nscenarios. \n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cContractual obligations and other commercial commitments\xe2\x80\x9d in Bal-\nance sheet and off-balance sheet and \xe2\x80\x9cNote 32 \xe2\x80\x93 Guarantees and commit-\nments\xe2\x80\x9d in VI \xe2\x80\x93 Consolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group for \nfurther information on contractual maturities of guarantees and commitments.\n\nContractual maturity of assets and liabilities\n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \nend of 2018\xc2\xa0 \n\nAssets (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCash and due from banks\xc2\xa0 \nInterest-bearing deposits with banks\xc2\xa0 \nCentral bank funds sold, securities purchased under\xc2\xa0 \nresale agreements and securities borrowing transactions\xc2\xa0 \nSecurities received as collateral, at fair value\xc2\xa0 \nTrading assets, at fair value\xc2\xa0 \nInvestment securities\xc2\xa0 6\nOther investments\xc2\xa0 \nNet loans\xc2\xa0 \nPremises and equipment\xc2\xa0 \nGoodwill\xc2\xa0 \nOther intangible assets\xc2\xa0 \nBrokerage receivables\xc2\xa0 \nOther assets\xc2\xa0 \nTotal assets\xc2\xa0 \n\nLiabilities\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDue to banks\xc2\xa0 \nCustomer deposits\xc2\xa0 \nCentral bank funds purchased, securities sold under\xc2\xa0 \nrepurchase agreements and securities lending transactions\xc2\xa0 \nObligation to return securities received as collateral, at fair value\xc2\xa0 \nTrading liabilities, at fair value\xc2\xa0 \nShort-term borrowings\xc2\xa0 \nLong-term debt\xc2\xa0 \nBrokerage payables\xc2\xa0 \nOther liabilities\xc2\xa0 \nTotal liabilities\xc2\xa0 \n\n   \n   \nOn demand   \n\n   \nLess than   \n1 month   \n\nBetween   \n1 to 3   \nmonths   \n\nBetween   \n3 to 12   \nmonths   \n\nBetween   \n1 to 5   \nyears   \n\nGreater   \nthan   \n5 years   \n\n91,378   \n0   \n   \n38,725   \n41,465   \n132,203   \n   \n0   \n10,276   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n38,907   \n15,648   \n368,608   \n\n6,530   \n230,527   \n   \n9,700   \n41,465   \n42,169   \n0   \n0   \n30,923   \n20,515   \n381,829   \n\n933   \n359   \n   \n48,407   \n79   \n0   \n0   \n18   \n54,432   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n2,635   \n106,863   \n\n2,106   \n43,789   \n   \n10,892   \n79   \n0   \n3,113   \n676   \n0   \n7,060   \n67,715   \n\n3,698   \n356   \n   \n14,771   \n152   \n0   \n57   \n0   \n32,510   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n3,612   \n55,156   \n\n5,283   \n55,808   \n   \n3,965   \n152   \n0   \n10,144   \n3,593   \n0   \n65   \n79,010   \n\n32   \n377   \n   \n10,996   \n0   \n0   \n794   \n0   \n47,849   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n4,976   \n65,024   \n\n961   \n32,160   \n   \n4   \n0   \n0   \n8,669   \n22,202   \n0   \n479   \n64,475   \n\n328   \n42   \n   \n4,196   \n0   \n0   \n2   \n0   \n98,057   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n2,938   \n105,563   \n\n226   \n834   \n   \n62   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n70,246   \n0   \n1,108   \n72,476   \n\n3,678   \n8   \n   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n2,052   \n4,872   \n44,457   \n4,838   \n4,766   \n219   \n0   \n2,812   \n67,702   \n\n114   \n807   \n   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n57,591   \n0   \n880   \n59,392   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \nTotal \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n100,047 \n1,142 \n \n117,095 \n41,696 \n132,203 \n2,911 \n4,890 \n287,581 \n4,838 \n4,766 \n219 \n38,907 \n32,621 \n768,916 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n15,220 \n363,925 \n \n24,623 \n41,696 \n42,169 \n21,926 \n154,308 \n30,923 \n30,107 \n724,897 \n\nLiquidity and funding management\n\n119\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nAs of the end of 2018, we had outstanding long-term debt of \nCHF\xc2\xa0154.3\xc2\xa0billion, which included senior and subordinated instru-\nments.

Credit ratings are especially important \nto us when competing in certain markets and when seeking to \nengage in longer-term transactions, including over-the-counter \n(OTC) derivative instruments.\n\nA downgrade in credit ratings could reduce our access to capital \nmarkets, increase our borrowing costs, require us to post addi-\ntional collateral or allow counterparties to terminate transac-\ntions under certain of our trading and collateralized financing and \nderivative contracts. This, in turn, could reduce our liquidity and \nnegatively impact our operating results and financial position. Our \ninternal liquidity barometer takes into consideration contingent \nevents associated with a two-notch downgrade in our credit rat-\nings. The maximum impact of a simultaneous one, two or three-\nnotch downgrade by all three major rating agencies in the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s \nlong-term debt ratings would result in additional collateral require-\nments or assumed termination payments under certain derivative \ninstruments of CHF\xc2\xa00.2\xc2\xa0billion, CHF\xc2\xa01.0\xc2\xa0billion and CHF\xc2\xa01.3\xc2\xa0bil-\nlion, respectively, as of December 31, 2018, and would not be \nmaterial to our liquidity and funding planning. If the downgrade \ndoes not involve all three rating agencies, the impact may be \nsmaller. \n\nInterest rate management \nInterest rate risk inherent in banking book activities, such as lend-\ning and deposit-taking, is managed through the use of replication \nportfolios. Treasury develops and maintains the models needed \nto determine the interest rate risks of products that do not have a \ndefined maturity, such as demand and savings accounts. For this \npurpose, a replicating methodology is applied in close coordina-\ntion with Risk Management to maximize the stability and sustain-\nability of spread revenues at the divisions. Furthermore, Treasury \nmanages the interest exposure of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s equity to targets \nagreed with senior management.\n\nDebt issuances and redemptions \nOur long-term debt includes senior, senior bail-in and subordi-\nnated debt issued in US-registered offerings and medium-term \nnote programs, euro medium-term note programs, stand-alone \nofferings, structured note programs, covered bond programs, \nAustralian dollar domestic medium-term note programs and a \nSamurai shelf registration statement in Japan. As a global bank, \nwe have access to multiple markets worldwide and our major \nfunding centers are New York, London, Zurich and Tokyo.\n\nWe use a wide range of products and currencies to ensure that \nour funding is efficient and well diversified across markets and \ninvestor types. Substantially all of our unsecured senior debt is \nissued without financial covenants, such as adverse changes in \nour credit ratings, cash flows, results of operations or financial \nratios, which could trigger an increase in our cost of financing \nor accelerate the maturity of the debt. Our covered bond fund-\ning is in the form of mortgage-backed loans funded by domestic \ncovered bonds issued through Pfandbriefbank Schweizerischer \nHypothekarinstitute, one of two institutions established by a 1930 \nact of the Swiss Parliament to centralize the issuance of covered \nbonds, or historically from our own international covered bond \nprogram.\n\nThe following table provides information on long-term debt issu-\nances, maturities and redemptions in 2018, excluding structured \nnotes.\n\nDebt issuances and redemptions\n\xc2\xa0 \nin 2018\xc2\xa0 \n\n  \nSenior  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nLong-term debt (CHF billion, notional value)\xc2\xa0 \n \nIssuances\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which unsecured\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which secured\xc2\xa01 \nMaturities / Redemptions\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which unsecured\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which secured\xc2\xa01 \n\n0.8  \n0.0  \n0.8  \n12.4  \n10.2  \n2.2  \n\nSenior  \nbail-in  \n\nSub-    Long-term \ndebt \n\nordinated   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5.2  \n5.2  \n0.0  \n0.0  \n0.0  \n0.0  \n\n4.0   \n4.0   \n0.0   \n11.1   \n11.1   \n0.0   \n\n10.0 \n9.2 \n0.8 \n23.5 \n21.3 \n2.2 \n\nExcludes structured notes.\n1 Includes covered bonds.\n\n120\n\nLiquidity and funding management\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nPotential cash outflows on these derivative contracts associated \nwith a downgrade of our long-term debt credit ratings, such as \nthe requirement to post additional collateral to the counterparty, \nthe loss of re-hypothecation rights on any collateral received and \nimpacts arising from additional termination events, are monitored \nand taken into account in the calculation of our liquidity require-\nments. There are additional derivative related risks that do not \nrelate to the downgrade of our long-term debt credit ratings and \nwhich may impact our liquidity position, including risks relating to \nholdings of derivatives collateral or potential movements in the \nvaluation of derivatives positions. The potential outflows resulting \nacross all derivative product types are monitored as part of the \nLCR scenario parameters and the internal liquidity reporting. \n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cInvestor information\xe2\x80\x9d in the Appendix for further information on Group \n\nand Bank credit ratings.\n\nCash flows from operating, investing and financing \nactivities \nAs a global financial institution, our cash flows are complex and \ninterrelated and bear little relation to our net earnings and net \nassets. Consequently, we believe that traditional cash flow analy-\nsis is less meaningful in evaluating our liquidity position than the \nliquidity and funding policies described above. Cash flow analysis \nmay, however, be helpful in highlighting certain macro trends in \nour business.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash provided by \noperating activities of continuing operations was CHF\xc2\xa012.8\xc2\xa0bil-\nlion, primarily reflecting an increase in net trading assets and \nliabilities and a decrease in other assets, partially offset by a \ndecrease in other liabilities. Our operating assets and liabilities \nvary significantly in the normal course of business due to the \namount and timing of cash flows. Management believes cash \nflows from operations, available cash balances and short-term \nand long-term borrowings will be sufficient to fund our operating \nliquidity needs.\n\nOur investing activities primarily include originating loans to be \nheld to maturity, other receivables and the investment securities \nportfolio. For the year ended December 31, 2018, net cash used \nin investing activities from continuing operations was CHF\xc2\xa07.4\xc2\xa0bil-\nlion, primarily due to an increase in loans, partially offset by a \ndecrease in proceeds from sales of loans.\n\nOur financing activities primarily include the issuance of debt \nand receipt of customer deposits. We pay annual dividends on \nour common shares. In 2018, net cash used in financing activities \nof continuing operations was CHF\xc2\xa015.1\xc2\xa0billion, mainly reflect-\ning the repayment of long-term debt, the repurchase of treasury \nshares, the decrease in short-term borrowings and the decrease \nin central bank funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase \nagreements and securities lending transactions, partially offset by \nthe issuance of long-term debt and the sale of treasury shares.\n\nLiquidity and funding management\n\n121\n\n\x0c \n\nCapital management\n\n \n\nAs of the end of 2018, our BIS CET1 ratio was 12.6% and our BIS tier\xc2\xa01 \nleverage ratio was 5.2%.\n\nCapital strategy\n\nCredit Suisse considers a strong and efficient capital posi-\ntion to be a priority. Through our capital strategy, our goal is to \nstrengthen our capital position and optimize the use of risk-\nweighted assets (RWA), particularly in light of emerging regula-\ntory capital requirements.\n\nof certain capital instruments. Look-through assumes the full \nphase-in of goodwill and other intangible assets and other regula-\ntory adjustments and the phase-out of certain capital instru-\nments. Our capital metrics fluctuate during any reporting period in \nthe ordinary course of business.\n\nBIS Requirements\n\nThe overall capital needs of Credit Suisse reflect management\xe2\x80\x99s \nregulatory and credit rating objectives as well as our underly-\ning risks. Our framework considers the capital needed to absorb \nlosses, both realized and unrealized, while remaining a strongly \ncapitalized institution. Multi-year projections and capital plans are \nprepared for the Group and its major subsidiaries and reviewed \nthroughout the year with their regulators. These plans are subject \nto various stress tests, reflecting both macroeconomic and spe-\ncific risk scenarios. Capital contingency plans are developed in \nconnection with these stress tests to ensure that possible mitigat-\ning actions are consistent with both the amount of capital at risk \nand the market conditions for accessing additional capital.\n\nThe BCBS, the standard setting committee within the Bank for \nInternational Settlements (BIS), issued the Basel\xc2\xa0III framework, \nwith higher minimum capital requirements and conservation and \ncountercyclical buffers, revised risk-based capital measures, \na leverage ratio and liquidity standards. The framework was \ndesigned to strengthen the resilience of the banking sector and \nrequires banks to hold more capital, mainly in the form of com-\nmon equity. The new capital standards were phased in from 2013 \nthrough 2018 and became fully effective on January 1, 2019 for \nthose countries that have adopted Basel\xc2\xa0III.\n > Refer to the table \xe2\x80\x9cBIS phase-in requirements for Credit Suisse\xe2\x80\x9d for capital \n\nrequirements and applicable effective dates during the phase-in period.\n\nRegulatory framework\n\nCredit Suisse is subject to the Basel\xc2\xa0III framework, as imple-\nmented in Switzerland, as well as Swiss legislation and regula-\ntions for systemically important banks (Swiss Requirements), \nwhich include capital, liquidity, leverage and large exposure \nrequirements and rules for emergency plans designed to main-\ntain systemically relevant functions in the event of threatened \ninsolvency.\n\nThe Basel framework describes a range of options for determin-\ning capital requirements in order to provide banks and supervisors \nthe ability to select approaches that are most appropriate for their \noperations and their financial market infrastructure. In general, \nCredit Suisse has adopted the most advanced approaches, which \nalign with the way that risk is internally managed and provide the \ngreatest risk sensitivity.\n\nReferences to phase-in and look-through included herein refer to \nBasel\xc2\xa0III capital requirements and Swiss Requirements. Phase-in \nreflects that, for the years 2014 \xe2\x80\x93 2018, there was a five-year \n(20% per annum) phase-in of goodwill, other intangible assets \nand other capital deductions (e.g., certain deferred tax assets) \nand a phase-out of an adjustment for the accounting treatment of \npension plans. For the years 2013 \xe2\x80\x93 2022, there is a phase-out \n\nUnder Basel\xc2\xa0III, the minimum common equity tier\xc2\xa01 (CET1) \nrequirement is 4.5% of RWA. In addition, a 2.5% CET1 capital \nconservation buffer is required to absorb losses in periods of \nfinancial and economic stress. \n\nA progressive buffer between 1% and 2.5% (with a possible addi-\ntional 1% surcharge) of CET1, depending on a bank\xe2\x80\x99s systemic \nimportance, is an additional capital requirement for global sys-\ntemically important banks (G-SIBs). The Financial Stability Board \n(FSB) has identified Credit Suisse as a G-SIB and has advised \nthat a progressive buffer of 1% will apply to Credit Suisse begin-\nning in January 2019.\n\nCET1 capital is subject to certain regulatory deductions and \nother adjustments to common equity, including the deduction \nof deferred tax assets for tax-loss carry-forwards, goodwill and \nother intangible assets.\n\nIn addition to the CET1 requirements, there is also a require-\nment for 1.5% of additional tier\xc2\xa01 capital and 2% of tier\xc2\xa02 capital. \nThese requirements may also be met with CET1 capital. To qual-\nify as additional tier\xc2\xa01 under Basel\xc2\xa0III, capital instruments must \nprovide for principal loss absorption through a conversion into \ncommon equity or a write-down of principal feature. The trigger \nfor such conversion or write-down must include a CET1 ratio of at \nleast 5.125% as well as a trigger at the point of non-viability.\n\n122\n\nCapital management\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nCapital frameworks for Credit Suisse\n\nBIS Requirements \n\nSwiss Requirements\n\nCountercyclical buffer up to \n\n2.5% CET1\n\nCountercyclical buffer up to \n\n2.5% CET1\n\n28.6%\n\n14.3%1  \n\nBail-in debt instruments\n\n14.3%\n\n4.3%  \n\nAdditional tier 1\n\n10%\n\n5.5% CET1  \n\nBuffer component\n\n4.5% CET1  \n\nMinimum component\n\nn\nr\ne\nc\nn\no\nc\n \ne\nn\no\nG\n\nn\nr\ne\nc\nn\no\nc\n \ng\nn\no\nG\n\ni\n\n11.5%\n\n2% Tier 2 \n\n9.5%\n\n1.5%  Additional tier 1\n\n8%\n\n 1% Progressive buffer\n\n2.5%  \n\nCapital conservation buffer\n\n4.5% CET1\n\n1 Does not include any rebates for resolvability and for certain tier 2 low-trigger instruments \n\nrecognized in gone concern capital.\n\nBasel\xc2\xa0III further provides for a countercyclical buffer that could \nrequire banks to hold up to 2.5% of CET1. This requirement is \nimposed by national regulators where credit growth is deemed to \nbe excessive and leading to the build-up of system-wide risk.\n\nCapital instruments that do not meet the strict criteria for inclu-\nsion in CET1 are excluded. Capital instruments that would no \nlonger qualify as tier\xc2\xa01 or tier\xc2\xa02 capital will be phased out. In addi-\ntion, instruments with an incentive to redeem prior to their stated \nmaturity, if any, are phased out at their effective maturity date, \nwhich is generally the date of the first step-up coupon.\n\nAs of January\xc2\xa01, 2018, banks are required to maintain a tier\xc2\xa01 \nleverage ratio of 3%.\n\nBIS phase-in requirements for Credit Suisse\nFor\xc2\xa0 \n\n2018   \n\n2019 \n\n \n\n \n\n4.5%   \n1.875%   1 \n1.125%   1 \n7.5%   \n1.5%   \n9.0%   \n2.0%   \n11.0%   \n100.0%   \n\n4.5% \n2.5% \n1.0% \n8.0% \n1.5% \n9.5% \n2.0% \n11.5% \n100.0% \nPhased out over a 10-year horizon \nbeginning 2013 through 2022\n\n \n\nCapital ratios\xc2\xa0 \nCET1\xc2\xa0 \nCapital conservation buffer\xc2\xa0 \nProgressive buffer for G-SIB\xc2\xa0 \nTotal CET1\xc2\xa0 \nAdditional tier 1\xc2\xa0 \nTier 1\xc2\xa0 \nTier 2\xc2\xa0 \nTotal capital\xc2\xa0 \nPhase-in deductions from CET1\xc2\xa0 \nCapital instruments \xc2\xa0 \nsubject to phase-out\xc2\xa0 \n\n1 Indicates phase-in period.\n\nSwiss Requirements\n\nThe legislation implementing the Basel\xc2\xa0III framework in Switzer-\nland in respect of capital requirements for systemically relevant \nbanks, including Credit Suisse, goes beyond the Basel\xc2\xa0III mini-\nmum standards for systemically relevant banks.\n\nThe Swiss regulation framework includes certain requirements for \nSwiss banks classified as systemically important banks operat-\ning internationally, such as Credit Suisse. It contains two different \nminimum requirements for loss-absorbing capacity: G-SIBs must \nhold sufficient capital that absorbs losses to ensure continu-\nity of service (going concern requirement), and they must issue \nsufficient debt instruments to fund an orderly resolution without \nrecourse to public resources (gone concern requirement). Going \nconcern capital and gone concern capital together form our total \nloss-absorbing capacity (TLAC). The going concern and gone \nconcern requirements are generally aligned with the FSB\xe2\x80\x99s total \nloss-absorbing capacity standard. The Swiss requirements are \nsubject to phase-in and grandfathering provisions for certain out-\nstanding instruments, and have to be fully applied by January\xc2\xa01, \n2020. Banks that do not maintain the minimum requirements may \nbe limited in their ability to pay dividends and make discretionary \nbonus payments and other earnings distributions.\n\nGoing concern requirement\nThe going concern requirement applicable in 2020 for a G-SIB \nconsists of (i) a base requirement of 12.86% of RWA and 4.5% of \nleverage exposure; and (ii) a surcharge, which reflects the G-SIB\xe2\x80\x99s \nsystemic importance. For Credit Suisse, this currently translates into \na going concern requirement of 14.3% of RWA, of which the \nminimum CET1 component is 10%, with the remainder to be met \nwith a maximum of 4.3% additional tier\xc2\xa01 capital, which includes \nhigh-trigger capital instruments that would be converted into \ncommon equity or written down if the CET1 ratio falls below 7%. \nUnder the going concern requirement, the Swiss leverage ratio \nmust be 5%, of which the minimum CET1 component is 3.5%, \nwith the remainder to be met with a maximum of 1.5% additional \ntier\xc2\xa01 capital, which includes high-trigger capital instruments.\n\nCapital management\n\n123\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nGone concern requirement\nThe gone concern requirement of a G-SIB is equal to its total going \nconcern requirement, which in 2020, consists of a base requirement \nof 12.86% of RWA and 4.5% of leverage exposure, plus any sur-\ncharges applicable to the relevant G-SIB. The gone concern require-\nment does not include any countercyclical buffers. Credit Suisse is \ncurrently subject to a gone concern requirement of 14.3% of RWA \nand a 5% Swiss leverage ratio and is subject to potential capital \nrebates for resolvability and for certain tier 2 low-trigger instruments \nrecognized as gone concern capital.\n\nThe gone concern requirement should primarily be fulfilled with bail-\nin instruments that are designed to absorb losses after the write-\ndown or conversion into equity of regulatory capital of a G-SIB in a \nrestructuring scenario, but before the write-down or conversion into \nequity of other senior obligations of the G-SIB. Bail-in instruments \ndo not feature capital triggers that may lead to a write-down and/or a \nconversion into equity outside of restructuring, but only begin to bear \nlosses once the G-SIB is formally in restructuring proceedings and \nFINMA orders capital measures (i.e., a write-down and/or a conver-\nsion into equity) in the restructuring plan.\n\nBail-in instruments must fulfill certain criteria in order to qualify under \nthe gone concern requirement, including FINMA approval. In addition \nto bail-in instruments, the gone concern requirement may further \nbe fulfilled with other capital instruments, including CET1, additional \ntier\xc2\xa01 capital instruments or tier 2 capital instruments.\n\nGrandfathering provisions\nThe Capital Adequacy Ordinance provides for a number of grand-\nfathering provisions with regard to the qualification of previ-\nously issued additional tier 1 capital instruments and tier 2 capital \ninstruments:\np  Additional tier\xc2\xa01 capital instruments with a low trigger qualify \nas going concern capital until their first call date. Additional \ntier\xc2\xa01 capital instruments that no longer qualify as going con-\ncern capital pursuant to this provision qualify as gone concern \ncapital;\n\np  Tier\xc2\xa02 capital instruments with a high trigger qualify as going \nconcern capital until the earlier of (i) their maturity date or first \ncall date; and (ii) December\xc2\xa031, 2019. Tier\xc2\xa02 capital instru-\nments that no longer qualify as going concern capital pursuant \nto this provision qualify as gone concern capital until one year \nbefore their final maturity; and\n\np  Tier\xc2\xa02 capital instruments with a low trigger also qualify as \n\ngoing concern capital until the earlier of (i) their maturity date \nor first call date; and (ii) December\xc2\xa031, 2019. Tier 2 capital \ninstruments that no longer qualify as going concern capital \npursuant to this provision qualify as gone concern capital until \none year before their final maturity.\n\nBoth the going concern and the gone concern requirements are \nsubject to a phase-in with gradually increasing requirements and \nhave to be fully applied by January\xc2\xa01, 2020.\n\n124\n\nCapital management\n\nFINMA decrees\nThe SNB designated the Group as a financial group of systemic \nimportance under applicable Swiss law. FINMA requires the \nGroup to fully comply with the special requirements for systemi-\ncally important banks operating internationally, which include \ncapital adequacy requirements and also specify liquidity and risk \ndiversification requirements.\n\nIn December 2013, FINMA issued a decree (2013 FINMA \nDecree), effective since February 2, 2014, specifying capital \nadequacy requirements for the Bank on a stand-alone basis (Bank \nparent company), and for the Bank and the Group, each on a con-\nsolidated basis, as systemically relevant institutions.\n\nIn October 2017, FINMA issued an additional decree with respect \nto the regulatory capital requirements of the Bank parent com-\npany (2017 FINMA Decree), specifying the treatment of invest-\nments in subsidiaries for capital adequacy purposes. This decree \npartially replaced certain aspects of the 2013 FINMA Decree, \nbut all other aspects of that decree remain in force. The 2017 \nFINMA Decree was effective retroactively as of July\xc2\xa01, 2017. \nThe changes aim to create a capital adequacy framework for the \nBank parent company that is more comparable to relevant inter-\nnational frameworks and does not rely on exemptions from, or \ncorrections of, the basic framework applicable to all Swiss banks. \nThe changes only apply to the going concern capital require-\nments for the Bank parent company, which, as of July\xc2\xa01, 2017, \namounted to 14.3% of RWA, of which the minimum CET1 com-\nponent was 10%, with the remainder to be met with a maximum \nof 4.3% additional tier 1 capital, which includes high-trigger capi-\ntal instruments. Additional effects from countercyclical buffers \nimpact the CET1 minimum requirement. Under the going concern \nrequirement, the Swiss leverage ratio must be 5%, of which the \nminimum CET1 component is 3.5%, with the remainder to be met \nwith a maximum of 1.5% additional tier 1 capital, which includes \nhigh-trigger capital instruments. Unlike the Group requirements, \nthe capital and leverage requirements for the Bank parent com-\npany are not subject to a transition period.\n\nThe 2017 FINMA Decree requires the Bank parent company to \nrisk-weight both direct and indirect investments in subsidiaries, \nwith the initial risk-weight set at 200%. Beginning in 2019, these \nrisk-weights will gradually increase over 10 years to 250% for \nparticipations in subsidiaries in Switzerland and to 400% for par-\nticipations in subsidiaries abroad. \n\nThe 2017 FINMA Decree also applies an adjustment (referred to \nas a regulatory filter) to any impact on CET1 capital arising from \nthe upcoming accounting change under applicable Swiss banking \nrules for the Bank parent company\xe2\x80\x99s investments in subsidiaries \nfrom the current portfolio valuation method to the individual valua-\ntion method by 2020. The regulatory filter allows for the measure-\nment of the regulatory capital position as if the Bank parent com-\npany had maintained the portfolio valuation method, which results \nin higher total participation values subject to risk weighting.\n > Refer to credit-suisse.com/regulatorydisclosures for the Bank parent com-\n\npany\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory disclosures.\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nSwiss capital and leverage phase-in requirements for Credit Suisse\n\nCapital ratio (%)\n\nLeverage ratio (%)\n\n8.9\n\n3.4\n\n14.3\n\nn\nr\ne\nc\nn\no\nc\n \ne\nn\no\nG\n\n11.6\n\n4.3\n\n3.9\n\nn\nr\ne\nc\nn\no\nc\n \ng\nn\no\nG\n\ni\n\n9.46\n\n9.68\n\n10.0\n\n3.0\n\n1.1\n\n2.9\n\n4.0\n\n1.3\n\n3.2\n\nn\nr\ne\nc\nn\no\nc\n \n\ne\nn\no\nG\n\nn\nr\ne\nc\nn\no\nc\n \ng\nn\no\nG\n\ni\n\n5.0\n\n1.5\n\n3.5\n\np\xc2\xa0Bail-in debt instruments \np\xc2\xa0Additional tier 1 \np\xc2\xa0CET1\n\nEffective as of January 1, for the applicable year\xc2\xa0 \n\n2018   \n\n2019   \n\n2020   \n\n2018   \n\n2019   \n\n2020 \n\nCapital components (%)\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \n \n \nCET1 \xe2\x80\x93 minimum\xc2\xa0 \nAdditional tier 1 \xe2\x80\x93 maximum\xc2\xa0 \nMinimum component\xc2\xa0 \nCET1 \xe2\x80\x93 minimum\xc2\xa0 \nAdditional tier 1 \xe2\x80\x93 maximum\xc2\xa0 \nBuffer component\xc2\xa0 \nGoing concern\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which base requirement\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which surcharge\xc2\xa0 \nGone concern\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which base requirement\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which surcharge\xc2\xa0 \nTotal loss-absorbing capacity\xc2\xa0 \n\n5.4   \n2.6   \n8.0   \n4.06   \n0.8   \n4.86   \n12.86   \n12.86   \n0.0   \n8.9   \n8.18   \n0.72   \n21.76   \n\n4.9   \n3.1   \n8.0   \n4.78   \n0.8   \n5.58   \n13.58   \n12.86   \n0.72   \n11.6   \n10.52   \n1.08   \n25.18   \n\n4.5   \n3.5   \n8.0   \n5.5   \n0.8   \n6.3   \n14.3   \n12.86   \n1.44   \n14.3   \n12.86   \n1.44   \n28.6   \n\n1.9   \n1.1   \n3.0   \n1.0   \n0.0   \n1.0   \n4.0   \n4.0   \n0.0   \n3.0   \n2.75   \n0.25   \n7.0   \n\n1.7   \n1.3   \n3.0   \n1.5   \n0.0   \n1.5   \n4.5   \n4.5   \n0.0   \n4.0   \n3.625   \n0.375   \n8.5   \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n1.5 \n1.5 \n3.0 \n2.0 \n0.0 \n2.0 \n5.0 \n4.5 \n0.5 \n5.0 \n4.5 \n0.5 \n10.0 \n\nDoes not include the effects of the countercyclical buffers and any rebates for resolvability and for certain tier 2 low-trigger instruments recognized in gone concern capital.  \nAs of the end of 2018, the Swiss countercyclical buffer for the Group and the Bank was CHF 506 million, which is equivalent to 0.2% of CET1 capital, and the required extended counter-\ncyclical buffer was insignificant. As of the end of 2018, the rebate for resolvability relating to the Group and the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s capital ratios was 1.424%, resulting in a gone concern requirement \nof 7.476%, and 0.48% relating to the leverage ratios, resulting in a gone concern leverage requirement of 2.52%.\n\nCapital management\n\n125\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nOther requirements\nRequirements in Switzerland include an extended countercyclical \nbuffer, which is based on the BIS countercyclical buffer that could \nrequire banks to hold up to 2.5% of RWA in the form of CET1 cap-\nital. The extended countercyclical buffer relates to a requirement \nthat can be imposed by national regulators when credit growth is \ndeemed to be excessive and leading to the build-up of system-wide \nrisk.\n\nThe Swiss Federal Council has not activated the BIS countercycli-\ncal buffer for Switzerland but instead requires banks to hold CET1 \ncapital in the amount of 2% of their RWA pertaining to mortgage \nloans that finance residential property in Switzerland (Swiss coun-\ntercyclical buffer).\n\nFINMA requirements include capital charges for mortgages that \nfinance owner-occupied residential property in Switzerland (mort-\ngage multiplier) that were phased in through January\xc2\xa01, 2019. \nThe mortgage multiplier applies for purposes of both BIS and \nFINMA requirements.\n\nOther regulatory disclosures\nIn connection with the implementation of Basel\xc2\xa0III, certain regula-\ntory disclosures for the Group and certain of its subsidiaries are \nrequired. The Group\xe2\x80\x99s Pillar\xc2\xa03 disclosure, regulatory disclosures, \nadditional information on capital instruments, including the main \nfeatures and terms and conditions of regulatory capital instru-\nments and total loss-absorbing capacity-eligible instruments \nthat form part of the eligible capital base and total loss-absorb-\ning capacity resources, G-SIB financial indicators, reconciliation \nrequirements, leverage ratios and certain liquidity disclosures as \nwell as regulatory disclosures for subsidiaries can be found on our \nwebsite.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9ccredit-suisse.com/regulatorydisclosures\xe2\x80\x9d for additional information.\n\nRegulatory developments\n\nIn May 2018, the BCBS published the revised standard on sim-\nple, transparent and comparable (STC) securitizations. It includes \nthe STC criteria developed for short-term securitizations and \ntheir preferential capital treatment. The new rules were effective \nimmediately.\n\nIn July 2018, the BCBS issued a revised assessment method-\nology for G-SIBs. The revised methodology is expected to be \nimplemented by national authorities by 2021 and is expected to \ndetermine a G-SIB\xe2\x80\x99s applicable higher loss absorbency require-\nments from January 2023.\n\nIn July 2018, FINMA published revised circulars on the further \nimplementation of Basel\xc2\xa0III in Switzerland, which, in general, \nbecame effective on January\xc2\xa01, 2019. This revision package is \none of the final steps in the Swiss implementation of the Basel\xc2\xa0III \nstandards and includes the following circulars:\np  \xe2\x80\x9cEligible capital \xe2\x80\x93 banks\xe2\x80\x9d, which added final transitional guide-\nlines for the calculation of regulatory capital related to the new \ncurrent expected credit loss model under US GAAP, which will \nbecome effective for us as of January\xc2\xa01, 2020;\n\np  \xe2\x80\x9cInterest rate risks \xe2\x80\x93 banks\xe2\x80\x9d, in which FINMA will not apply the \n\noptional standardized framework according to Basel\xc2\xa0III stan-\ndards; instead it will broaden the scope of existing interest rate \nreporting arrangements; and\n\np  Other minor revisions to circulars, including new disclosure \n\ntables on key metrics and interest rate risks, total loss-absorb-\ning capital, remuneration and value adjustments.\n\nIn October 2018, FINMA announced its reassessment of rebates \nfor resolvability relating to the gone concern requirement. The \neligibility for the rebates for resolvability is assessed on an annual \nbasis. Effective July\xc2\xa01, 2018, the rebate for resolvability relat-\ning to the capital ratio was 1.424%, resulting in a gone concern \nrequirement of 7.476%, and 0.48% relating to the leverage ratio, \nresulting in a gone concern leverage requirement of 2.52%.\n\nIn November 2018, the Swiss Federal Council issued a revision \nof the Capital Adequacy Ordinance. It includes changes to the \ngone-concern requirements and the treatment for the holding \nof bail-in instruments which are issued by third party banks. The \nrevised standards became effective in January 2019.\n\nIn December 2018, BCBS published the updated framework on \nPillar\xc2\xa03 disclosure requirements. These requirements, together \nwith the updates published in January 2015 and March 2017, \ncomplete the Pillar\xc2\xa03 framework. The revised framework covers \nthree elements. The first element, to be implemented by Janu-\nary\xc2\xa01, 2022, relates to revisions and additions arising from the \nfinalization of the Basel\xc2\xa0III regulatory reforms in 2017. As a sec-\nond element, the updated framework sets out new disclosure \nrequirements on asset encumbrance. As a third element, the \nrevised framework introduces new disclosure requirements relat-\ning to national supervisors imposing constraints on capital distri-\nbutions. The second and third elements must be implemented by \nend-2020.\n\nIn January 2019, the BCBS released revisions to the minimum \ncapital requirements for market risk, which included changes to \nthe internal models approach and the standardized approach. \nThe revisions also included amendments to the definition of the \nboundary between the trading book and the banking book. The \nrevised standard will become effective in January 2022.\n\n126\n\nCapital management\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nCapital instruments\n\nIssuances and redemptions\n\xc2\xa0 \nend of 2018\xc2\xa0 \n\nIssuances \xe2\x80\x93 callable bail-in instruments\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \n \nFirst quarter of 2018\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \nSecond quarter of 2018\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \nThird quarter of 2018\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \nFourth quarter of 2018\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n2019 to date\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\nIssuances \xe2\x80\x93 high-trigger capital instruments\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \n \nThird quarter of 2018\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\nRedemptions\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \n \nThird quarter of 2018\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \nFourth quarter of 2018\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\n   \nCurrency   \n\nAmount   \n(million)   \n\n   \nInterest rate (%)   \n\n   \nDescription   \n\n \nDue date \n\nUSD   \nAUD   \nAUD   \nAUD   \nUSD   \nUSD   \nUSD   \nUSD   \nEUR   \nUSD   \nUSD   \nUSD   \nUSD   \nUSD   \nUSD   \nUSD   \n\nUSD   \nCHF   \nUSD   \n\nUSD   \nCHF   \nUSD   \nUSD   \nUSD   \nCHF   \n\n2,000   \n176   \n125   \n175   \n305   \n1,250   \n750   \n145   \n100   \n190   \n100   \n100   \n120   \n120   \n100   \n1,050   \n\n2,000   \n300   \n1,500   \n\n1,000   \n290   \n2,000   \n1,720   \n1,725   \n2,500   \n\n3.869   \n\xe2\x80\x93   \n3.5   \nfloating rate   \n\xe2\x80\x93   \n4.207   \nfloating rate   \n\xe2\x80\x93   \n2.455   \n\xe2\x80\x93   \n\xe2\x80\x93   \n\xe2\x80\x93   \n\xe2\x80\x93   \n\xe2\x80\x93   \n\xe2\x80\x93   \nfloating rate   \n\n7.5   \n3.5   \n7.25   \n\n3.3   \n6.0   \n3.3   \n9.5   \n9.5   \n9.0   \n\nSenior notes   \nZero coupon accreting senior notes   \nSenior notes   \nSenior notes   \nZero coupon accreting senior notes   \nSenior notes   \nSenior notes   \nZero coupon accreting senior notes   \nSenior notes   \nZero coupon accreting senior notes   \nZero coupon accreting senior notes   \nZero coupon accreting senior notes   \nZero coupon accreting senior notes   \nZero coupon accreting senior notes   \nZero coupon accreting senior notes   \nSenior notes   \n\nPerpetual tier 1 contingent write-down capital notes   \nPerpetual tier 1 contingent write-down capital notes   \nPerpetual tier 1 contingent write-down capital notes   \n\nPerpetual tier 1 capital notes   \nLow-trigger perpetual tier 1 capital notes   \nPerpetual tier 1 capital notes   \nHigh-trigger perpetual tier 1 capital notes   \nHigh-trigger perpetual tier 1 capital notes   \nHigh-trigger perpetual tier 1 capital notes   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n2029 \n2038 \n2024 \n2024 \n2048 \n2024 \n2024 \n2048 \n2034 \n2048 \n2048 \n2048 \n2049 \n2049 \n2049 \n2024 \n\n \n \n \n \n\xe2\x80\x93 \n\xe2\x80\x93 \n\xe2\x80\x93 \n\n \n \n \n \n\xe2\x80\x93 \n\xe2\x80\x93 \n\xe2\x80\x93 \n\xe2\x80\x93 \n\xe2\x80\x93 \n\xe2\x80\x93 \n\nContingent convertible capital instruments\nWe have issued high-trigger and low-trigger capital instruments \nto meet our capital requirements. Our high-trigger instruments \neither mandatorily convert into our ordinary shares or their princi-\npal amount is written down to zero upon the occurrence of certain \nspecified triggering events. These events include our CET1 ratio \nfalling below 7% (or any lower applicable minimum threshold), \nor a determination by FINMA that conversion is necessary, or \nthat we require public sector capital support, to prevent us from \nbecoming insolvent, bankrupt or unable to pay a material amount \nof our debts, or other similar circumstances. Conversion can only \nbe prevented if FINMA, at our request, is satisfied that cer-\ntain conditions exist and conversion is not required. High-trigger \ninstruments are designed to absorb losses before our other capi-\ntal instruments, including the low-trigger capital instruments. The \nfeatures of low-trigger capital instruments are described below. \nContingent Capital Awards would not convert into common equity, \nbut would be written down to zero upon a trigger event.\n\nHigher Trigger Capital Amount\nThe capital ratio write-down triggers for certain of our outstand-\ning capital instruments take into account the fact that other out-\nstanding capital instruments that contain relatively higher capital \n\nratios as part of their trigger feature are expected to convert into \nequity or be written down prior to the write-down of such capital \ninstruments. The amount of additional capital that is expected to \nbe contributed by such conversion into equity or write-down is \nreferred to as the Higher Trigger Capital Amount.\n\nThe following tier\xc2\xa01 capital notes (collectively, Tier\xc2\xa01 Capital \nNotes), which have a trigger amount of 5.125% and qualify as low \ntrigger capital instruments, were outstanding as of December 31, \n2018:\np  USD\xc2\xa02.5 billion 6.25% tier\xc2\xa01 capital notes; and\np  USD\xc2\xa02.25 billion 7.5% tier\xc2\xa01 capital notes.\n\nThe following tier\xc2\xa02 capital notes (collectively, Tier\xc2\xa02 Capital \nNotes), which have a trigger amount of 5% and qualify as low \ntrigger capital instruments, were outstanding as of December 31, \n2018:\np  USD\xc2\xa02.5 billion 6.5% tier\xc2\xa02 capital notes; and\np  EUR\xc2\xa01.25 billion 5.75% tier\xc2\xa02 capital notes.\n\nEach of the series of Tier\xc2\xa01 Capital Notes and Tier\xc2\xa02 Capital Notes \nqualify as low-trigger capital instruments and have a write-down fea-\nture, which means that the full principal amount of the notes will be \n\nCapital management\n\n127\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\npermanently written down to zero upon the occurrence of specified \ntriggering events. These events occur when the amount of our CET1 \nratio, together with an additional ratio described below that takes into \naccount other outstanding capital instruments, falls below 5.125% \nfor the Tier\xc2\xa01 Capital Notes and 5% for the Tier\xc2\xa02 Capital Notes. The \nwrite-down can only be prevented if FINMA, at our request, is satis-\nfied that certain conditions exist and determines a write-down is not \nrequired. The capital notes will also be written down upon a non-via-\nbility event, which occurs when FINMA determines that a write-down \nis necessary, or that we require extraordinary public sector capital \nsupport, to prevent us from becoming insolvent, bankrupt or unable \nto pay a material amount of our debts, or other similar circumstances.\n\nWith respect to the capital instruments that specify a trigger \nevent if the CET1 ratio were to fall below 5.125%, the Higher \nTrigger Capital Amount was CHF\xc2\xa05.6 billion and the Higher Trig-\nger Capital Ratio (i.e., the ratio of the Higher Trigger Capital \nAmount to the aggregate of all RWA of the Group) was 2.0%, \nboth as of the end of 2018.\n\nWith respect to the capital instruments that specify a trigger \nevent if the CET1 ratio were to fall below 5%, the Higher Trig-\nger Capital Amount was CHF\xc2\xa010.2 billion and the Higher Trigger \nCapital Ratio was 3.6%, both as of the end of 2018.\n > Refer to the table \xe2\x80\x9cBIS capital metrics \xe2\x80\x93 Group\xe2\x80\x9d for further information on the \n\nBIS metrics used to calculate such measures.\n\nBIS capital metrics\n\nOur CET1 ratio was 12.6% as of the end of 2018 compared to \n13.5% as of the end of 2017, with lower CET1 capital and higher \nRWA.

When assessing RWA, it is not the nominal \nsize, but rather the nature (including risk mitigation such as col-\nlateral or hedges) of the balance sheet positions or off-balance \nsheet exposures that determines the RWA. \n\nCredit risk RWA reflect the capital requirements for the pos-\nsibility of a loss being incurred as the result of a borrower or \ncounterparty failing to meet its financial obligations or as a result \nof a deterioration in the credit quality of the borrower or coun-\nterparty. Under Basel\xc2\xa0III, certain regulatory capital adjustments \nare dependent on the level of CET1 capital (thresholds). The \namount above the threshold is deducted from CET1 capital and \nthe amount below the threshold is risk weighted. RWA subject \nto such threshold adjustments are included in credit risk RWA. \nFor measuring the capital requirements related to credit risk, \nwe received approval from FINMA to use the advanced internal \nratings-based (A-IRB) approach. Under the A-IRB approach \nfor measuring credit risk, risk weights are determined by using \ninternal risk parameters for probability of default (PD), loss given \ndefault (LGD) and effective maturity. The exposure at default \n(EAD) is either derived from balance sheet values or by using \nmodels. For the capital requirements for counterparty credit risk, \nwe implemented the advanced credit valuation adjustment (CVA), \nwhich covers the risk of mark-to-market losses on the expected \ncounterparty risk arising from changes in a counterparty\xe2\x80\x99s credit \nspreads.\n\nMarket risk RWA reflect the capital requirements of potential \nchanges in the fair values of financial instruments in response \nto market movements inherent in both balance sheet and \n\noff-balance sheet items. For calculating the capital require-\nments related to market risk, the internal models and standard-\nized approaches are used. Within the Basel framework for FINMA \nregulatory capital purposes, we implemented risk measurement \nmodels, including an incremental risk charge (IRC), stressed \nvalue-at-risk (VaR) and risks not in VaR (RNIV).\n\nThe IRC is a regulatory capital charge for default and migration \nrisk on positions in the trading books and is intended to comple-\nment additional standards being applied to the VaR modeling \nframework, including stressed VaR. Stressed VaR replicates \na VaR calculation on the Group\xe2\x80\x99s current portfolio, taking into \naccount a one-year observation period relating to significant \nfinancial stress and helps reduce the pro-cyclicality of the mini-\nmum capital requirements for market risk. RNIV and stressed \nRNIV are risks that are not currently implemented within the \nGroup\xe2\x80\x99s VaR model, such as certain basis risks, higher order risks \nand cross risks. For capital purposes, FINMA, in line with BIS \nrequirements, uses a multiplier to impose an increase in market \nrisk capital for every regulatory VaR backtesting exception above \nfour in the prior rolling 12-month period. In 2018, our market risk \ncapital multiplier remained at FINMA and BIS minimum levels and \nwe did not experience an increase in market risk capital.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cMarket risk review\xe2\x80\x9d in Risk management for further information.\n\nOperational risk RWA reflect the capital requirements for the \nrisk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal pro-\ncesses, people and systems or from external events. For cal-\nculating the capital requirements related to operational risk, we \nreceived approval from FINMA to use the advanced measurement \napproach (AMA). Under the AMA for measuring operational risk, \nwe have identified key scenarios that describe our major opera-\ntional risks using an event model.\n\nRisk-weighted assets \xe2\x80\x93 Group\n\nas of December 31, 2018 (CHF billion)\n\nOff-balance sheet \nexposures\n\nBalance sheet \npositions\n\nOff-balance sheet \nderivatives\n\nGuarantees, commitments\n\nTrading assets &  \ninvestments1\nSecurities financing \ntransactions2\nLoans, receivables and \nother\xc2\xa0assets\n\nPremises and equipment\n\nRisk-weighted  \nassets \n\nMarket risk \n\n285\n\n19\n\nTrading liabilities, short \npositions\nSecurities financing \ntransactions2\n\n19\n34\n\n5\n\n151\n\nCredit risk \n\n195\n\n5\n\n1 Includes primarily trading assets, investment securities and other investments.   \n2 Includes central bank funds sold, securities purchased under resale agreements and central bank funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements and securities  lending \n\ntransactions.\n\nOperational risk \n\n71\n\nProcesses, people, systems, \nexternal events\n\nCapital management\n\n131\n\n\x0c \n\nRisk-weighted assets \xe2\x80\x93 Group\n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \nend of\xc2\xa0 \n\n2018 (CHF million) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCredit risk\xc2\xa0 \nMarket risk\xc2\xa0 \nOperational risk\xc2\xa0 \nRisk-weighted assets \xe2\x80\x93 phase-in / look-through\xc2\xa0 \n\n2017 (CHF million) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCredit risk\xc2\xa0 \nMarket risk\xc2\xa0 \nOperational risk\xc2\xa0 \nRisk-weighted assets \xe2\x80\x93 phase-in\xc2\xa0 \nLook-through adjustment\xc2\xa0 \nRisk-weighted assets \xe2\x80\x93 look-through\xc2\xa0 \n\nRisk-weighted assets movements\n\n \n\n \n \n \nGroup \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n194,899 \n18,643 \n71,040 \n284,582 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n176,512 \n21,290 \n75,013 \n272,815 \n(1,135) \n271,680 \n\n   \n   \nAsia   \nPacific   \n\n27,102   \n3,507   \n6,547   \n37,156   \n\n20,510   \n5,128   \n5,836   \n31,474   \n\xe2\x80\x93   \n31,474   \n\nInvestment   \n   \n    Banking &   \n\n   \nStrategic   \n\n   \n   \nCapital    Resolution    Corporate   \nMarkets   \nCenter   \n\nUnit   \n\nGlobal   \nMarkets   \n\n35,380   \n9,158   \n14,478   \n59,016   \n\n34,185   \n11,334   \n13,339   \n58,858   \n\xe2\x80\x93   \n58,858   \n\n20,498   \n200   \n3,492   \n24,190   \n\n17,362   \n121   \n2,575   \n20,058   \n\xe2\x80\x93   \n20,058   \n\n5,834   \n1,305   \n10,787   \n17,926   \n\n12,078   \n1,875   \n19,660   \n33,613   \n\xe2\x80\x93   \n33,613   \n\n16,201   \n1,489   \n12,013   \n29,703   \n\n14,960   \n994   \n9,030   \n24,984   \n(1,135)   \n23,849   \n\n   \n\n   \nSwiss    International   \nWealth   \nBank   Management   \n\nUniversal   \n\n63,280   \n1,315   \n11,880   \n76,475   \n\n52,776   \n737   \n12,059   \n65,572   \n\xe2\x80\x93   \n65,572   \n\n26,604   \n1,669   \n11,843   \n40,116   \n\n24,641   \n1,101   \n12,514   \n38,256   \n\xe2\x80\x93   \n38,256   \n\non certain investment banking corporate exposures in Investment \nBanking & Capital Markets, Global Markets and Asia Pacific. The \nincrease from model and parameter updates was primarily related \nto advanced CVA resulting from increased market volatility in the \nVaR model, primarily in the Strategic Resolution Unit and Swiss \nUniversal Bank. The increase also reflected a phase-in of the \nRWA impact of an updated ship finance rating model in Interna-\ntional Wealth Management.\n\nExcluding the foreign exchange impact, the decrease in market \nrisk was primarily driven by movements in risk levels, partially \noffset by increases resulting from model and parameter updates. \nThe decrease in risk levels was primarily in Global Markets and \nAsia Pacific. The increase in model and parameter updates mainly \nreflected time series updates and model enhancements to VaR \nimpacting Global Markets, International Wealth Management and \nAsia Pacific.\n\nThe decrease in operational risk was mainly driven by meth-\nodology and policy changes and movements in risk levels. The \ndecrease in methodology and policy changes in the Corporate \nCenter was in connection with the external transfer of our US \nprivate banking business. In addition, a new operational risk allo-\ncation key was agreed with FINMA, reducing RWA relating to \noperational risk in the Strategic Resolution Unit by CHF\xc2\xa08.9 bil-\nlion and allocating this primarily to the Corporate Center, Global \nMarkets, Investment Banking & Capital Markets and Asia Pacific. \nThe decrease in risk levels was mainly due to increased insurance \nbenefits attributable to the Corporate Center, Global Markets, \nAsia Pacific and Investment Banking & Capital Markets.\n\nRWA increased 4% to CHF\xc2\xa0284.6 billion as of the end of 2018 \nfrom CHF\xc2\xa0272.8 billion as of the end of 2017. The increase was \nprimarily driven by increases in movements in risk levels and \nmethodology and policy changes in credit risk and an increase \nrelating to model and parameter updates in market risk and credit \nrisk. These increases were partially offset by decreases in move-\nments in risk levels in market risk and operational risk and meth-\nodology and policy changes in operational risk.\n\nExcluding the foreign exchange impact, the increase in credit \nrisk was primarily driven by increases related to movements \nin risk levels attributable to book size, methodology and policy \nchanges and model and parameter updates. The increase in risk \nlevels attributable to book size was mainly due to increases in \nlending risk exposures, primarily in Swiss Universal Bank, Asia \nPacific and Global Markets. These increases were partially offset \nby the impact of hedging transactions executed in connection \nwith managing the Group\xe2\x80\x99s RWA exposures in Global Markets, \nSwiss Universal Bank and Asia Pacific, decreases relating to \nderivative exposures in Global Markets and the Strategic Resolu-\ntion Unit, decreases in lending risk exposures in the Strategic \nResolution Unit and decreases in securitization exposures in Inter-\nnational Wealth Management and the Strategic Resolution Unit. \nThe increase resulting from methodology and policy changes was \nprimarily due to an additional phase-in of the multiplier on income \nproducing real estate (IPRE) and non-IPRE exposures, both \nwithin Swiss Universal Bank, increases reflecting the implementa-\ntion of the new Basel\xc2\xa0III

framework, the leverage ratio measures tier\xc2\xa01 \ncapital against the end-of-period exposure. As used herein, lever-\nage exposure consists of period-end balance sheet assets and \nprescribed regulatory adjustments.\n\nThe look-through leverage exposure was CHF\xc2\xa0881.4 billion as \nof the end of 2018, a decrease of 4% compared to CHF\xc2\xa0916.5 \nbillion as of the end of 2017. The decrease in leverage exposure \nwas mainly due to a reduction in the Group\xe2\x80\x99s consolidated bal-\nance sheet, primarily reflecting lower operating activities, partially \noffset by the foreign exchange translation impact.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cBalance sheet and off-balance sheet\xe2\x80\x9d for further information on the \n\nreduction in the Group\xe2\x80\x99s consolidated balance sheet.\n\nLeverage exposure components \xe2\x80\x93 Group\n\xc2\xa0 \nend of\xc2\xa0 \n\nLeverage exposure (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \n \n \nBalance sheet assets\xc2\xa0 \nAdjustments\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Difference in scope of consolidation and tier 1 capital deductions\xc2\xa01 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Derivative financial instruments\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Securities financing transactions\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Off-balance sheet exposures\xc2\xa0 \nTotal adjustments\xc2\xa0 \nLeverage exposure\xc2\xa0 \n\nLook-through leverage exposure \xe2\x80\x93 Group\nend of\xc2\xa0 \n\nLook-through leverage exposure (CHF million) \n \nSwiss Universal Bank\xc2\xa0 \nInternational Wealth Management\xc2\xa0 \nAsia Pacific\xc2\xa0 \nGlobal Markets\xc2\xa0 \nInvestment Banking & Capital Markets\xc2\xa0 \nStrategic Resolution Unit\xc2\xa0 \nCorporate Center\xc2\xa0 \nLeverage exposure\xc2\xa0 \n\n2018   \n\n2017 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n255,480   \n98,556   \n106,375   \n245,664   \n40,485   \n29,579   \n105,247   \n881,386   \n\n257,054 \n99,267 \n105,585 \n283,809 \n43,842 \n59,934 \n67,034 \n916,525 \n\nBIS leverage ratios \xe2\x80\x93 Group\nThe tier\xc2\xa01 leverage ratio was 5.2% as of the end of 2018, com-\npared to 5.6% as of the end of 2017, reflecting lower tier\xc2\xa01 capi-\ntal and lower leverage exposure.

The decisions regarding these parameters are made by \n\nCARMC and are regularly reviewed. Foreign exchange risk asso-\nciated with the nonfunctional currency net assets of branches and \nsubsidiaries is managed through a combination of forward-look-\ning and concurrent backward-looking hedging activity, which is \naimed at reducing the foreign exchange rate induced volatility of \nreported earnings.\n\nCapital management\n\n139\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nPurchases and sales of treasury shares\n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \nin\xc2\xa0 \n\n   \nNumber   \nof shares   \n(million)   \n\nAverage \nprice \nper share \n(CHF) \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2018\xc2\xa0 \nJanuary\xc2\xa0 \nFebruary\xc2\xa0 \nMarch\xc2\xa0 \nApril\xc2\xa0 \nMay\xc2\xa0 \nJune\xc2\xa0 \nJuly\xc2\xa0 \nAugust\xc2\xa0 \nSeptember\xc2\xa0 \nOctober\xc2\xa0 \nNovember\xc2\xa0 \nDecember\xc2\xa0 \nTotal purchase of treasury shares\xc2\xa0 \nTotal sale of treasury shares\xc2\xa0 \n\n59.8   \n64.2   \n86.1   \n41.1   \n73.2   \n91.0   \n46.4   \n59.4   \n92.5   \n77.1   \n83.2   \n42.8   \n816.8   \n770.6   \n\n18.10 \n17.30 \n16.98 \n16.11 \n16.31 \n15.27 \n15.10 \n15.10 \n14.93 \n13.60 \n12.51 \n11.01 \n\xe2\x80\x93 \n\xe2\x80\x93 \n\nDividends and dividend policy\n\nUnder the Swiss Code of Obligations, dividends may be paid out \nonly if and to the extent the corporation has distributable profits \nfrom previous business years, or if the free reserves of the corpo-\nration are sufficient to allow distribution of a dividend. In addition, \nat least 5% of the annual net profits must be retained and booked \nas general legal reserves for so long as these reserves amount \nto less than 20% of the paid-in share capital. Our reserves cur-\nrently exceed this 20% threshold. Furthermore, dividends may be \npaid out only after shareholder approval at the AGM. The Board \nof Directors may propose that a dividend be paid out, but cannot \nitself set the dividend. In Switzerland, the auditors are required \nto confirm whether the appropriation of retained earnings is in \naccordance with Swiss law and the company\xe2\x80\x99s articles of incorpo-\nration. In practice, the shareholders usually approve the dividend \nproposal of the Board of Directors. Dividends are usually due and \npayable after the shareholders\xe2\x80\x99 resolution relating to the allocation \nof profits has been passed. Under the Swiss Code of Obligations, \nthe statute of limitations in respect of claiming the payment of \ndividends that have been declared is five years.\n\nShare repurchases\n\nThe Swiss Code of Obligations limits a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s ability to hold \nor repurchase its own shares. We may only repurchase shares if \nwe have sufficient free reserves to pay the purchase price, and \nif the aggregate nominal value of the repurchased shares does \nnot exceed 10% of our nominal share capital. Furthermore, we \nmust create a special reserve in our parent company\xe2\x80\x99s financial \nstatements in the amount of the purchase price of the acquired \nshares. In our consolidated financial statements, own shares are \nrecorded at cost and reported as treasury shares, resulting in a \nreduction in total shareholders\xe2\x80\x99 equity. Shares repurchased by us \ndo not carry any voting rights at shareholders\xe2\x80\x99 meetings.\n\nFor 2018, there was no publicly announced share repurchase \nprogram in place. We purchased 817 million treasury shares and \nsold or re-issued 771 million treasury shares in 2018 through \nopen market transactions, predominantly for market-making \npurposes and facilitating customer orders as well as to meet the \nGroup\xe2\x80\x99s delivery obligations with respect to share-based com-\npensation. As of December 31, 2018, the Group held 5 million \ntreasury shares.\n\nFor 2019, the Board of Directors of the Group approved a share \nbuyback program of Group ordinary shares of up to CHF\xc2\xa01.5 bil-\nlion. We expect to buy back at least CHF\xc2\xa01.0 billion in 2019, sub-\nject to market and economic conditions. For 2020, we expect a \nsimilar share buyback program as in 2019, subject to approval by \nthe Board of Directors. The level of the share buyback for 2020 \nwill be set in light of our capital plans and subject to prevailing \nmarket conditions, but is expected to be in line with our intention \nto distribute at least 50% of net income.\n\nWe commenced the 2019 share buyback program on January\xc2\xa014, \n2019. We are acquiring our own shares on a second trading line \non SIX Swiss Exchange, subject to deduction of applicable Swiss \nfederal withholding tax. The repurchased shares are expected to \nbe cancelled by means of a capital reduction to be proposed at a \nfuture Annual General Meeting (AGM) of shareholders.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cImpact of share-based compensation on shareholders\xe2\x80\x99 equity\xe2\x80\x9d in V \xe2\x80\x93 \n\nCompensation \xe2\x80\x93 Group compensation for further information.\n\n140\n\nCapital management\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nThe dividend payment made in 2018 for the financial year 2017 \nconsisted of a distribution of CHF\xc2\xa00.25 per share payable out \nof capital contribution reserves in cash. The distribution was \nfree of Swiss withholding tax and was not subject to income \ntax for Swiss resident individuals holding the shares as a private \ninvestment.\n\nOur dividend payment policy seeks to provide investors with an \nefficient form of capital distribution relative to earnings. We have \nrevised our dividend policy beginning in 2017 by discontinuing the \nproposal of a scrip alternative at the option of shareholders and by \ninstead proposing to pay an all-cash dividend per share at a level \nsimilar to the cash component (as opposed to the stock compo-\nnent) per share of the total dividend that our shareholders elected \nin recent years, subject to performance and to the decision of \nthe Board of Directors and approval of our shareholders in due \ncourse. We expect to generate a sustainable ordinary dividend for \nshareholders in 2019 and 2020, and to increase the ordinary divi-\ndend by at least 5% per annum.\n\nOur Board of Directors will propose to the shareholders at the \nAGM on April\xc2\xa026, 2019 a distribution of CHF\xc2\xa00.2625 per share \nout of capital contribution reserves for the financial year 2018. \nThe distribution will be free of Swiss withholding tax and will not \nbe subject to income tax for Swiss resident individuals holding the \nshares as a private investment. The distribution will be payable in \ncash. The ex-dividend date has been set to May\xc2\xa03, 2019.\n\nReflecting our holding company structure, the Group is not an \noperating company and holds investments in subsidiaries. It is \ntherefore reliant on the dividends of its subsidiaries to pay share-\nholder dividends and service its long-term debt. The subsidiar-\nies of the Group are generally subject to legal restrictions on the \namount of dividends they can pay. The amount of dividends paid \nby operating subsidiaries is determined after consideration of \nthe expectations for future results and growth of the operating \nbusinesses.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cProposed distribution out of capital contribution reserves\xe2\x80\x9d in VII \n\xe2\x80\x93 Parent company financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group \xe2\x80\x93 Proposed \nappropriation of retained earnings and capital distribution for further informa-\ntion on dividends.\n\nDividend per ordinary share\n\xc2\xa0 \n\nDividend per ordinary share for the financial year\xc2\xa0 \n2017\xc2\xa0 \n2016\xc2\xa0 \n2015\xc2\xa0 \n2014\xc2\xa0 \n2013\xc2\xa0 \n\nUSD   1 \n\nCHF \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n0.25   \n0.72   \n0.72   \n0.75   \n0.79   \n\n0.25 \n0.70 \n0.70 \n0.70 \n0.70 \n\n1 Represents the distribution on each American Depositary Share.

Other significant risk developments were political and \neconomic policy developments in the eurozone, the implementa-\ntion of new sanctions against Russia, the process surrounding the \nexpected withdrawal of the UK from the European Union and the \nglobal economic slowdown. There were also concerns over volatil-\nity and liquidity in the markets.\n\nTrade tensions\nThe risk of global trade tensions became a major concern of \nglobal investors beginning in early 2018. The escalation of ten-\nsions between the US and China continued during the course of \nthe year with both countries implementing tariffs. Trade tension \nconcerns also widened to include a number of other economies, \nincluding the eurozone, with impacts on sectors exposed to inter-\nnational trade such as ship finance. The impact of a shift towards \na more protectionist foreign trade policy by the US continues to \nbe assessed in various stress tests run at the Group, divisional or \nlegal entity level on a regular basis.\n\nEmerging markets vulnerabilities\nThe tightening of US monetary policy, the appreciation of the US \ndollar and the announcement and implementation of new tariffs \ntriggered capital outflows from emerging markets and the broad-\nbased sell-off of emerging markets currencies. Those global \nfactors, combined with some specific local vulnerabilities, led to \neconomic and political crises in a number of emerging market \ncountries. In addition, China\xe2\x80\x99s economic slowdown appeared to \nhave worsened in the final quarter of 2018. We closely monitor \ndevelopments in China and in other emerging markets as well as \nthe related risks in our portfolio and have implemented certain \nrisk-reduction measures.\n\nPolicy interest rates and credit cycle\nThe Fed continued tightening its monetary policy throughout \n2018. The ECB ended its asset purchase program and the Bank \nof England raised interest rates. In credit markets, there was \nsome concern over leveraged loans, a segment where issuance \nhas grown rapidly. We monitor potential risks associated with the \nmonetary policy tightening paths of the Fed and other major cen-\ntral banks through our suite of stress scenarios. We also closely \nmonitor the risks associated with any deterioration in the credit \nquality of the leverage loan portfolio.\n\nEuropean political landscape\nAfter initial uncertainties, Germany formed a government coalition \nearly in the year. Negotiations relating to the withdrawal of the UK \nfrom the EU remained a source of uncertainty in Europe in 2018. \nIn addition, discussions between the new coalition in Italy and \nthe European Commission over the 2019 budget brought some \nstress to Italian markets in the second half of 2018. We are con-\ntinuing to monitor developments and assess the potential negative \nimplications using a suite of stress scenarios.\n\nWithdrawal of the UK from the EU\nUncertainty over the outcome of the negotiations surrounding the \nanticipated withdrawal of the UK from the EU persisted through-\nout 2018 and early 2019. That uncertainty had a significant neg-\native impact on the UK economy in late 2018 and in early 2019 \nand was also a factor contributing to the economic slowdown in \nthe eurozone. The withdrawal agreement between the EU and \nthe UK has not yet been approved and it appears likely that there \nwill be a delay of the UK\xe2\x80\x99s withdrawal from the EU for a period of \ntime beyond March\xc2\xa029, 2019, although it is still possible that the \nUK could leave the EU without such an agreement in place. We \nare continuing to closely monitor this situation and its potential \nimpact on the Group.\n\nMarket liquidity and volatility\nThere has been significant structural change in the markets since \nthe 2008/2009 financial crisis. The amount of inventory held by \nbanks and broker-dealers has declined. The role in the markets \nof computer-driven investment strategies and of mutual funds and \nexchange-traded funds has significantly increased. Volatility in \nthe markets is heavily influenced by the asset purchase programs \nof the major central banks and has become a significant inves-\ntor concern, particularly since early February 2018 when equity \nmarkets fell, credit spreads widened and equity market volatility \nsignificantly increased. Such structural changes have increased \nthe threat that liquidity shortages could quickly develop in periods \nof stress and trigger large moves in the markets. The potential for \nliquidity shortages in stress periods and for spikes in volatility are \nembedded in the market risk shocks which form part of the suite \nof multi-quarter stress scenarios we have developed. That suite \nof stress scenarios is assessed on a monthly basis.\n\nSanctions involving Russia\nThe US Department of the Treasury\xe2\x80\x99s Office of Foreign Assets \nControl (OFAC) imposed sanctions in 2018 against Russian indi-\nviduals and companies. We identified impacted client relation-\nships and transactions to ensure compliance; additionally, our \nsanctions compliance group closely monitors the developments \nin collaboration with the businesses and the risk management \n\n142\n\nRisk management\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nfunction. Unless there are specific restrictions in place, we con-\ntinue serving Russian clients by applying enhanced due diligence \nprocedures.\n\nCyber risk\nThe financial industry is increasingly reliant on technology and \nfaces dynamic cyber threats from a variety of actors who are \ndriven by monetary, political and other motivations. We continue \nto invest significantly in an information and cybersecurity program \nin order to strengthen our ability to anticipate, defend against, \ndetect and recover from cyber attacks. We regularly assess the \neffectiveness of our key controls and conduct ongoing employee \ntraining and awareness activities, including for key management \npersonnel, in order to embed resilience and a strong cyber risk \nculture.\n\nRisk management oversight\n\nPrudent risk taking in line with our strategic priorities is funda-\nmental to our business. The primary objectives of risk manage-\nment are to protect our financial strength and reputation, while \nensuring that capital is well deployed to support business growth \nand activities. Our risk management framework is based on trans-\nparency, management accountability and independent oversight. \nRisk management is an integral part of our business planning pro-\ncess with strong senior management and Board involvement.\n\nWe continuously work to strengthen risk management across \nthe Group in our efforts to meet the challenges resulting from a \nvolatile market environment and increasing complexity driven by \nthe changing regulatory landscape. Utilizing comprehensive risk \nmanagement processes and sophisticated control systems, we \ncontinuously work to minimize the negative impact that may arise \nfrom risk concentrations.\n\nOrganizational development in 2019\n\nOn February\xc2\xa026, 2019, an organizational change relating to the \ncompliance functions was announced, effective immediately. The \nregulatory affairs function was separated from the compliance \norganization and integrated into the office of the CEO with the \nGlobal Head of Regulatory Affairs now reporting directly to the \nCEO.

The legal entity chief risk officer roles for \nour most significant legal entities are assumed by the divisional \nchief risk officers in their respective regions, except for Credit \nSuisse AG where the chief risk officer role is assumed by the \nGroup CRO.\n\nThe heads of the global functions and the divisional/legal entity \nchief risk officers jointly manage the embedded functional teams.\n\nCentral functions\nRisk and Finance Data Analytics, Reporting provides consistent \nreporting production, analytics and data management shared with \nfinance functions. CRO Change is responsible for the portfolio \nof strategic change programs across the risk management func-\ntion. The Group CRO\xe2\x80\x99s chief operating officer facilitates business \nmanagement within the risk management function. Credit Risk \nReview is a review function independent from credit risk manage-\nment with a direct reporting line to the Board\xe2\x80\x99s Risk Commit-\ntee, administratively reporting to the Group CRO. Credit Risk \nReview assesses Credit Suisse\xe2\x80\x99s credit exposures and credit risk \nmanagement processes and practices. Until August 2018, the \nhead of Credit Risk Review was responsible for our comprehen-\nsive capital analysis and review (CCAR) challenge function which \nsupports the application of the CCAR framework for our US \nintermediate holding company (IHC) and provides independent \nassessments of the processes for the development of the US \nIHC\xe2\x80\x99s capital plan. In August 2018, the CCAR challenge function \nresponsibilities were transferred to the senior management of our \nUS IHC. CCAR is a US regulatory framework introduced by the \nFed to assess, regulate and supervise large financial institutions.\n\nOn June\xc2\xa028, 2018, the Fed released results of its annual CCAR \nstress tests, for the first time publicly releasing results for our US \nIHC. Our US IHC was projected to maintain capital ratios above \nminimum regulatory requirements in the adverse and severely \nadverse CCAR stress scenarios, and the Fed did not object to its \nproposed capital plan. As part of the stress testing requirements \nof the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection \nAct (Dodd-Frank Act), our US IHC was also required to conduct \n\na mid-cycle stress test using a set of internally developed mac-\nroeconomic scenarios and submit the results to the Fed in Octo-\nber 2018. As previously disclosed, our US IHC was projected to \nmaintain capital ratios above minimum regulatory requirements \nunder the internally developed severely adverse scenario.\n\nCompliance\n\nThe compliance function is a proactive, independent function \nworking with the businesses to continuously challenge practices \nto manage compliance risk. As a second line of defense function, \nresponsibilities include independently assessing compliance risk, \nmonitoring and testing and reporting on adherence to the compli-\nance risk appetite and other material matters to the Board and \nsenior management. It also oversees regulatory interactions of \nthe Group and assesses potential impact and monitors implemen-\ntation of regulatory developments.\n\nOur compliance organization supports the Group\xe2\x80\x99s strategy and \ndivisional structure, with the involvement of the divisional chief \ncompliance officers, who also provide compliance oversight for \nthe most significant legal entities in their respective regions. The \ndivisional chief compliance officers are responsible for providing \nindependent oversight and control over the compliance and regu-\nlatory risks relating to their respective divisions and legal entities.\n\nCentral compliance functions\n\nCentral compliance functions, such as core compliance services, \nfinancial crime compliance and investigations, support all divisions \nby overseeing and managing global programs in partnership with \nthe divisional chief compliance officers. The core compliance ser-\nvices function oversees framework design and establishes and \nmonitors enterprise level standards and controls for compliance \npractices, surveillance and global programs (e.g., cross-border \ncompliance, client tax compliance and conduct risk). The financial \ncrime compliance function establishes and monitors compliance \npolicies, guidelines, procedures and controls related to anti-\nmoney laundering, anti-corruption and sanctions. The investiga-\ntions function is responsible for the identification and remediation \nof significant breaches in the Group\xe2\x80\x99s compliance processes and \ncontrols.\n\nThe regulatory affairs function, reporting directly to the CEO \nsince the organizational change on February\xc2\xa026, 2019, supports \nthe Group through management of regulatory relationships and \ninteractions, including coordination of regulatory commitments on \nbehalf of relevant divisions. \n\nRisk culture\n\nWe base our business operations on conscious and disciplined \nrisk-taking. We believe that independent risk management, com-\npliance and audit processes with proper management account-\nability are critical to the interests and concerns of our stakehold-\ners. Our risk culture is supported by the following principles:\n\n146\n\nRisk management\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\np  We establish a clear risk appetite that sets out the types and \n\nlevels of risk we are prepared to take;\n\np  Our risk management and compliance policies set out authori-\n\nties and responsibilities for taking and managing risks;\n\np  We actively monitor risks and take mitigating actions where \n\nthey fall outside accepted levels;\n\np  Breaches of risk limits are identified, analyzed and escalated, \n\nand large, repeated or unauthorized exceptions may lead to \nterminations, adverse adjustments to compensation or other \ndisciplinary action; and\n\np  We seek to establish resilient risk constraints that promote \n\nmultiple perspectives on risk and reduce the reliance on single \nrisk measures.\n\nWe actively promote a strong risk culture where employees are \nencouraged to take accountability for identifying and escalating \nrisks and for challenging inappropriate actions. The businesses \nare held accountable for managing all of the risks they generate, \nincluding those relating to employee behavior and conduct, in line \nwith our risk appetite. Expectations on risk culture are regularly \ncommunicated by senior management, reinforced through policies \nand training, and considered in the performance assessment and \ncompensation processes and, with respect to employee conduct, \nassessed by formal disciplinary review committees.\n\nWe seek to promote responsible behavior through the Group\xe2\x80\x99s \nCode of Conduct, which provides a clear statement on the \nconduct standards and ethical values that we expect of our \nemployees and members of the Board, so that we maintain and \nstrengthen our reputation for integrity, fair dealing and measured \nrisk-taking. In addition, our six conduct and ethics standards, \nwhich include client focus, meritocracy, stakeholder management, \naccountability, partner and transparency, are a key part of our \neffort to embed our core ethical values into our business strategy \nand the fabric of our organization.\n\nThey are designed to encourage employees to act with responsi-\nbility, respect, honesty and compliance to secure the trust of our \nstakeholders. Initiatives in this area have provided employees with \npractical guidance on careful and considered behavior and the \nimportance of acting ethically and learning from mistakes. Our \nemployee performance assessment and compensation processes \nare linked to the conduct and ethics standards and the Group\xe2\x80\x99s \nCode of Conduct.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cConduct risk\xe2\x80\x9d in Risk coverage and management for further \n\ninformation.\n\nBCBS 239\n\nThe BCBS published the \xe2\x80\x9cPrinciples for effective risk data \naggregation and risk reporting\xe2\x80\x9d (BCBS 239) in 2013 in order to \nstrengthen the risk data aggregation and risk reporting practices \nat banks and enhance their risk management and decision-mak-\ning processes. Our program for implementing these principles \n\nregarding risk data aggregation and reporting at Credit Suisse \nwas completed and operational as of December\xc2\xa031, 2018 and we \nare in the process of evidencing compliance with the BCBS\xc2\xa0239 \nprinciples which we expect to complete in the first half of 2019.\n\nRisk appetite framework\nOverview\n\nWe maintain a comprehensive Group-wide risk appetite frame-\nwork, which is governed by a global policy and provides a robust \nfoundation for risk appetite setting and management across the \nGroup. A key element of the framework is a detailed statement of \nthe Board-approved risk appetite which is aligned to our financial \nand capital plans. The framework also encompasses the pro-\ncesses and systems for assessing the appropriate level of risk \nappetite required to constrain our overall risk profile.\n\nRisk capacity is the maximum level of risk that we can assume \ngiven our current level of resources before breaching any con-\nstraints determined by capital and liquidity needs, the operational \nenvironment and our responsibilities to depositors, shareholders, \ninvestors and other stakeholders. Risk appetite expresses the \naggregate level and types of risk we are willing to assume within \nour risk capacity to achieve our strategic objectives and busi-\nness plan. Risk profile is a point-in-time assessment of our net \nrisk exposures aggregated within and across each relevant risk \ncategory and is expressed in a variety of different quantitative risk \nmetrics and qualitative risk observations. The size of our risk pro-\nfile is restricted to the planned level of our risk appetite through \nthe use of risk constraints, such as limits, guidelines, tolerances \nand targets.\n\nKey aspects and process\n\nThe Group risk appetite framework is governed by an overarching \nglobal policy that encompasses the suite of specific policies, pro-\ncesses and systems with which the risk constraints are calibrated \nand the risk profile is managed. The framework is guided by the \nfollowing strategic risk objectives:\np  maintaining Group-wide capital adequacy above minimum regu-\nlatory requirements under both normal and stressed conditions;\np  promoting stability of earnings to support performance in line \n\nwith financial objectives;\n\np  ensuring sound management of liquidity and funding risk in \n\nnormal and stressed conditions;\n\np  proactively controlling concentration risks;\np  managing operational and compliance risk within our enter-\n\nprise risk and control framework (ERCF) to ensure sustainable \nperformance;\n\np  minimizing reputational risk; and\np  managing and mitigating conduct risk.\n\nRisk management\n\n147\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nRisk appetite framework \xe2\x80\x93 key definitions\n\nRisk capacity\n\nRisk appetite\n\nRisk profile\n\nRisk capacity Maximum level of risk that we can assume given our current level of \nresources before breaching any constraints determined by  capital and liquidity needs, the \noperational environment and our responsibilities to depositors, shareholders,  investors \nand other stakeholders.\n\nRisk appetite Aggregate level and types of risk we are willing to assume within our risk \ncapacity to achieve our strategic objectives and business plan.\n\nRisk profile Point-in-time assessment of our net risk exposures aggregated within and \nacross each  relevant risk category and expressed in a variety of different quantitative risk \nmetrics and qualitative risk observations.\n\nRisk constraints  \n\n(qualitative constraint statements, limits,  \nguidelines, tolerances, targets and flags)\n\nRisk constraints Quantitative and qualitative measures based on forward-looking \nassumptions that allocate our aggregate risk appetite to businesses, legal entities, risk \ncategories, concentrations and, as appropriate, other levels.\n\nGroup-wide risk appetite is determined in partnership with the \nfinancial and capital planning process on an annual basis, based \non bottom-up forecasts that reflect planned risk usage by the \nbusinesses and top-down, Board-driven strategic risk objectives \nand risk appetite. Scenario stress testing of financial and capital \nplans is an essential element in the risk appetite calibration pro-\ncess as a key means through which our strategic risk objectives, \nfinancial resources and business plans are aligned. The capital \nplans are also analyzed using our economic capital coverage \nratio, which provides a further means of assessing bottom-up risk \nplans with respect to available capital resources. The risk appe-\ntite is approved through a number of internal governance forums, \nincluding joint approval by the Group CRO and the CFO, the \nRisk Appetite Review Committee (a sub-committee of CARMC), \nCARMC and, subsequently, by the Board.\n\nThe risk appetite statement is the formal plan, approved by the \nBoard, for our Group-wide risk appetite. Key divisional allocations \nare cascaded from the Group and approved in divisional risk man-\nagement committees. Legal entity risk appetites are set by the \nlocal legal entity board of directors within the limits established by \nthe Group. The top-down and bottom-up risk appetite calibration \nprocess includes the following key steps:\n\nTop-down:\np  Group-level strategic risk objectives are agreed by the Board \n\nin line with our financial and capital objectives.\n\np  Top-down risk capacities and risk appetites are determined \n\nwith reference to available resources and key thresholds, such \nas minimum regulatory requirements.\n\ncomprises quantitative and qualitative risk measures necessary \nfor adequate control of the risk appetite across the organiza-\ntion. The review of the top-down and bottom-up risk appetite \nlevels and their allocation between divisions and legal entities \nis performed by the Risk Appetite Review Committee.\n\np  Separate legal entity risk appetite frameworks aligned to local \nregulatory requirements are in place for material subsidiaries. \nAn integrated year-end planning process ensures that individ-\nual legal entity risk appetites are consistent with Group levels.\np  Divisional risk committees are responsible for allocating risk \n\nappetite within the respective divisions based on individual \nbusiness line reviews and requirements.\n\nBottom-up:\np  Planned risk levels and related risk appetite requirements are \nprovided by front office business experts in conjunction with \nfinancial and capital plans in order to ensure consistency with \nthe business strategy. Risk plans are reviewed by the relevant \nrisk management committees.\n\np  Bottom-up risk forecasts are aggregated across businesses \nto assess divisional and Group-wide risk plans and to support \nmanagement decisions on variations to existing risk appetite \nlevels or the possible need for new risk appetite measures.\n\np  The effectiveness of risk appetite in support of business \n\nstrategy execution and delivery against financial objectives is \nassessed via a risk appetite effectiveness framework. This \nframework assists senior management and the Board in ensur-\ning that appropriate levels of risk appetite are set and that the \nsubsequent risk constraints are appropriately calibrated.\np  Risk, financial and capital plans are jointly reviewed and \n\np  A risk appetite statement is determined and approved annu-\n\napproved by the Executive Board and the Board.\n\nally by the Board, and is based on the strategic risk objectives, \nthe comprehensive scenario stress testing of our forecasted \nfinancial results and capital requirements, and our economic \ncapital framework.

The counterparties and \nassociated trades were transferred from the Strategic Resolution \nUnit back to the Global Markets and Investment Banking & Capi-\ntal Markets divisions in the first quarter of 2018. In the second \nquarter of 2018, after a business reassessment in connection \nwith our planning relating to the withdrawal of the UK from the \nEU, the Audit Committee approved the transfer of assets and lia-\nbilities relating to Credit Suisse (Deutschland) Aktiengesellschaft \nfrom the Strategic Resolution Unit to the Investment Banking & \nCapital Markets division.\n\nRisk constraints\n\nA core aspect of our risk appetite framework is a sound system \nof integrated risk constraints to maintain our risk profile within our \noverall risk appetite. Our risk appetite framework utilizes a suite \nof different types of risk constraints to reflect the aggregate risk \nappetite of the Group and to further cascade risk appetite across \nour organization, including among business divisions and legal \nentities. The risk constraints restrict our maximum balance sheet \nand off-balance sheet exposure given the market environment, \nbusiness strategy and financial resources available to absorb \nlosses. Different levels of seniority are mapped to, and specific \nenforcement and breach response protocols are required for, \neach type of risk constraint. We define the following risk con-\nstraint categories:\np  Qualitative constraints represent constraints that are used \n\nto manage identified but unquantifiable or subjective risks, \nwith adherence assessed by the appropriate level of constraint \nauthority.\n\np  Quantitative constraints represent constraints that are used \nto manage identified quantifiable risks and exist in the form of \nlimits, guidelines, tolerances, targets and flags.\n\nConstraint authority for the risk constraints is determined by the \nrelevant approving body and constraints are currently in effect \nfor all key risk governance bodies and committees including the \nBoard, its Risk Committee, the Executive Board and CARMC. \nThe appropriateness of the constraint types for the various risk \nclasses within our risk appetite, including market, credit, opera-\ntional and liquidity risk, is determined considering the respective \ncharacteristics of the various risk constraint types. We define the \nfollowing types of risk constraints:\np  Qualitative constraint statements are required for all quali-\ntative constraints. Qualitative constraint statements need to be \nspecific and to clearly define the respective risk to ensure that \nthe risk profile for unquantifiable or subjective risks is readily \nassessable.\n\np  Limits, guidelines and tolerances are specific threshold \nlevels for a given risk metric. Limits are binding thresholds \nthat require discussion to avoid a breach and trigger imme-\ndiate remediating action if a breach occurs. Guidelines are \nthresholds which, if breached, require an action plan to reduce \nrisk below the guideline or to propose, justify and agree to \nadjust the guideline. Tolerances are designed as management \nthresholds to initiate discussion, and breach of a tolerance \nlevel triggers review by the relevant constraint authority. \n\np  Targets represent the level of risk that the Group intends to \naccept in pursuit of business objectives at a specific point in \ntime in the future.\n\np  Flags are early warning indicators, which serve primarily as \na business risk management and supervisory control tool for \nour front offices, Treasury and the risk management function. \nFlags can be set for any quantifiable risk and may be comple-\nmentary to other types of constraints.\n\nWith respect to limits, guidelines and tolerances, established cri-\nteria are applied in the selection of the appropriate risk constraint, \nincluding the assessment of (i) the materiality of the respective \nrisk metric with regard to its contribution to the overall Group risk \nappetite; (ii) the importance of the risk constraint to the organiza-\ntion from a qualitative perspective; (iii) the characteristic of the \nrespective risk, e.g., risk concentrations or high priority risk for \n\nRisk management\n\n149\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nthe Group; and (iv) the availability of mitigating actions to manage \nthe risk profile of the Group in relation to the respective risk.\n\nWe have established a constraint structure which manages the \nGroup\xe2\x80\x99s risk profile using multiple metrics, including economic risk \ncapital, VaR, scenario analysis and various exposure limits at the \nGroup level. The overall risk limits for the Group are set by the \nBoard in consultation with its Risk Committee and are binding. In \nthe rare circumstance where a breach of these limits would occur, \nit would result in a notification to the Chair of the Board\xe2\x80\x99s Risk \nCommittee and the Group CEO, and written notification to the \nfull Board at its next meeting. Following notification, the Group \nCRO may approve positions that exceed the Board limits up to \na predefined level and any such approval is reported to the full \nBoard. Positions that exceed the Board limits by more than the \npredefined level may only be approved by the Group CRO and the \nfull Board acting jointly. In 2018 and 2017, no Board limits were \nexceeded.\n\nDedicated constraints are also in place to cover the specific risk \nprofiles of individual businesses and legal entities. In the context \nof the overall risk appetite of the Group, as defined by the limits \nset by the Board and its Risk Committee, CARMC is responsible \nfor allocating divisional risk limits and more specific limits deemed \nnecessary to control the concentration of risk within individual \nlines of business. The divisional risk management committees \nand the divisional and legal entity chief risk officers are respon-\nsible for allocating risk appetite further within the organization. \nFor this purpose, they use a detailed framework of individual risk \nlimits designed to control risk-taking at a granular level by indi-\nvidual businesses and in the aggregate. The risk constraints are \nintended to:\np  limit overall risk-taking to the Group\xe2\x80\x99s risk appetite;\np  trigger senior management discussions with the businesses \n\ninvolved, risk management and governance committees in \ncase of substantial change in the overall risk profile;\n\np  ensure consistent risk measurement across businesses;\np  provide a common framework for the allocation of resources to \n\nbusinesses; and\n\np  provide a basis for protecting the Group\xe2\x80\x99s capital base and \n\nmeeting strategic risk objectives.\n\nThe limit owners are responsible for reviewing warning triggers \nfor risk limits. They may set warning triggers for potential limit \nexcesses at any level lower than the approved limits as deemed \nappropriate after taking into account the nature of the underlying \nbusiness. Strict escalation procedures apply to any limit breaches \nand, depending on the severity of the excess, the Group CRO \nor divisional chief executive officer\xe2\x80\x99s approval may be required. \n\nSerious excesses are highlighted in periodic Risk Committee \nmeeting management summaries. An assessment by the disci-\nplinary review committee and any disciplinary actions that may be \ntaken are considered in the regular performance assessment and \ncompensation processes.\n\nRisk coverage and management\n\nWe use a wide range of risk management practices to address \nthe variety of risks that arise from our business activities. Poli-\ncies, processes, standards, risk assessment and measurement \nmethodologies, risk appetite constraints, and risk monitoring and \nreporting are key components of our risk management practices. \nOur risk management practices complement each other in our \nanalysis of potential loss, support the identification of interde-\npendencies and interactions of risks across the organization and \nprovide a comprehensive view of our exposures. We regularly \nreview and update our risk management practices to ensure con-\nsistency with our business activities and relevance to our business \nand financial strategies. Risk management practices have evolved \nover time without a standardized approach within the industry, \ntherefore comparisons across firms may not be meaningful. Our \nkey risk types, definitions and key risk evaluation methods are \nsummarized in the table \xe2\x80\x9cKey risk types overview\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nIt is important to both evaluate each risk type separately and \nassess their combined impact on the Group, which helps ensure \nthat our overall risk profile remains within the Group-wide risk \nappetite.\n\nThe primary evaluation methods used to assess Group-wide quan-\ntifiable risks include economic risk capital and stress testing. Eco-\nnomic risk capital captures both position risk, such as market risk \nand credit risk, and non-position risk, such as operational risk, pen-\nsion risk and certain business risks (e.g., expense risk, owned real \nestate risk and interest rate risk on treasury positions), and is a key \ncomponent in our risk appetite framework with limits established \nto control aggregate risk. Stress testing also captures position and \nnon-position risks and provides an evaluation method capable of \ncapturing both historic and forward-looking scenarios to ensure \nthat aggregate risks are managed within the Group-wide risk appe-\ntite also under stressed conditions.\n\nThe description of our economic risk capital methodology and \nour stress testing framework below is followed by a more detailed \ndescription of our key risk types.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cLiquidity and funding management\xe2\x80\x9d for further information on liquidity \nand funding risks-related evaluation methods used in our liquidity risk manage-\nment framework and for funding management.\n\n150\n\nRisk management\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nKey risk types overview\n\nKey risk types and definition\n\nKey risk evaluation methods\n\nLiquidity and funding risks: The risk that we do not have the appropriate amount of funding and liquidity \nto meet our obligations.\n\nLiquidity coverage ratio, net stable funding ratio, liquidity \nbarometer, stress testing\n\nMarket risk: The risk of financial loss from adverse changes in market risk factors, including interest rates, \ncredit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity and commodity prices, and other factors such as market \nvolatility and the correlation of market prices across asset classes.\nCredit risk: The risk of financial loss arising as a result of a borrower or counterparty failing to meet its \nfinancial obligations or as a result of deterioration in the credit quality of the borrower or counterparty.\n\nModel risk: The risk of adverse consequences from decisions made based on model results that may be \nincorrect, misinterpreted or used inappropriately.\n\nOperational risk: The risk of financial loss arising from inadequate or failed internal processes, people or \nsystems, or from external events.\n\nCompliance and regulatory risk: The risk from the failure to comply with laws, regulations, rules or \nmarket standards that may have a negative effect on our franchise and clients we serve.

Economic risk capital is our core Group-wide risk \nmanagement tool for measuring and reporting the combined \nimpact from quantifiable risks such as market, credit, operational, \npension and expense risks, each of which has an impact on our \ncapital position.\n\nUnder the Basel framework, we are required to maintain a robust \nand comprehensive framework for assessing capital adequacy, \ndefining internal capital targets and ensuring that these capital \ntargets are consistent with our overall risk profile and the current \noperating environment. Our economic risk capital model represents \nour internal view of the amount of capital required to support our \nbusiness activities.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cCapital strategy\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cRegulatory framework\xe2\x80\x9d in Capital management \n\nfor further information on our capital management framework.\n\nWith effect from January\xc2\xa01, 2018, we implemented a revised \neconomic risk capital framework. We redeveloped the position \nrisk methodology by introducing new and enhancing previously \nused credit and market risk models. Our redesigned credit risk \nmodel is based on a multi-factor Monte-Carlo-simulation, com-\npared to the single-factor model used previously. Our new market \nrisk model incorporates new price and spread shocks for securi-\ntized products and illiquid private equity investments and uses his-\ntorical simulation for equity and fixed income trading, compared to \nthe combination of credit spread shocks and historical simulation \nused in previous models. In October 2018, we further developed \nthe market risk framework, reflecting an improved recognition \nof hedging benefits between securitized products and underly-\ning hedges, a recalibration of the 99.97% \xe2\x80\x9cgone concern\xe2\x80\x9d scalars \nfor securitized products and certain traded risk, and an enhanced \nannualization approach. Market risks not covered by these mod-\nels are captured using a risk-not-in-economic-risk-capital model, \nwhich is now also part of the market risk framework reflected \nin position risk. In addition, during the first quarter of 2018, we \n\nRisk management\n\n151\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nenhanced the granularity of credit conversion factors and data \nfeeds for securitizations in our position risk model. Our position \nrisk categories reflect the redeveloped position risk methodol-\nogy and are described in the table \xe2\x80\x9cPosition risk categories\xe2\x80\x9d. In \nthe operational risk model, we removed the US private banking \nlosses from the data set, applied a discount to the RMBS losses \nto better reflect the internal view of the forward-looking risk pro-\nfile and, as a result of these modifications, updated the divisional \nallocations. Further, in the other risks category, we improved our \npension risk methodology to ensure that our pension plan assets \nand liabilities risk is modeled in line with the redeveloped position \nrisk framework. Finally, we introduced an enhanced and newly \ncalibrated correlation matrix to aggregate across all position, \noperational and other risk models, in order to make the correla-\ntions among risk categories more responsive to changes in the \nportfolio and in market conditions.\n\nDuring 2018, we further embedded the new economic risk capital \nframework into our risk appetite and risk management framework. \nThe new framework should enable us to better assess, monitor \nand manage capital adequacy and solvency risk in both \xe2\x80\x9cgoing con-\ncern\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cgone concern\xe2\x80\x9d scenarios. In a \xe2\x80\x9cgoing concern\xe2\x80\x9d scenario, \nwe hold sufficient capital to absorb losses to ensure continuity of \nservice. In a \xe2\x80\x9cgone concern\xe2\x80\x9d scenario, we hold sufficient capital to \nfund an orderly resolution without recourse to public resources.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cMethodology and model developments\xe2\x80\x9d in Risk review and results \xe2\x80\x93 \n\nEconomic risk capital review for further information.\n\nMethodology and scope\nEconomic risk capital measures risks in terms of economic reali-\nties rather than regulatory or accounting rules and estimates the \namount of capital needed to remain solvent and in business under \nextreme market, business and operating conditions over the period \nof one year, given our target financial strength (our long-term credit \nrating). Economic risk capital is set to a level needed to absorb \nunexpected losses at a confidence level of 99.97%. Our economic \nrisk capital model is a set of methodologies used for measuring \nquantifiable risks associated with our business activities on a con-\nsistent basis. It is calculated separately for position risk (reflecting \nour exposure to market and credit risks), operational risk and other \nrisks. Within each of these risk categories, risks are further divided \ninto subcategories, for which economic risk capital is calculated \nusing the appropriate specific methodology. Some of these meth-\nodologies are common to a number of risk subcategories, while \nothers are tailored to the particular features of single, specific risk \ntypes included in position risk, operational risk and other risks. Eco-\nnomic risk capital is calculated by aggregating position, operational \nand other risks.\n\nPosition risk and diversification benefit\nPosition risk is the level of unexpected loss from our portfolio of \nbalance sheet and off-balance sheet positions over a one-year \nholding period and includes market and credit risks. Position risk \nis calculated at a 99% confidence level for risk management pur-\nposes reflecting a \xe2\x80\x9cgoing concern\xe2\x80\x9d scenario. Position risk is also \ncalculated at a 99.97% confidence level for capital management \npurposes reflecting a \xe2\x80\x9cgone concern\xe2\x80\x9d resolution scenario. Our \nposition risks categories are described in the table \xe2\x80\x9cPosition risk \ncategories\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nTo determine our overall position risk, we consider the diversifica-\ntion benefit across risk types. Diversification benefit represents the \nreduction in risk that occurs when combining different, not perfectly \ncorrelated risk types in the same portfolio and is measured as the \ndifference between the sum of position risk for the individual risk \ntypes and the position risk calculated for the combined portfo-\nlio. Hence, position risk for the combined portfolio is non-additive \nacross risk types and is lower than the sum of position risk of its \nindividual risk types due to risk reduction (or benefit) caused by \nportfolio diversification. When analyzing position risk for risk man-\nagement purposes, we look at individual risk types before and after \nthe diversification benefit.\n\nAs part of our overall risk management, we hold a portfolio of \nhedges. Hedges are impacted by market movements, similar to \nother trading securities, and may result in gains or losses which \noffset losses or gains on the portfolios they were designated to \nhedge. Due to the varying nature and structure of hedges, these \ngains or losses may not wholly offset the losses or gains on the \nportfolios.\n\nOperational risk\nOperational risk is the risk of financial loss arising from inad-\nequate or failed internal processes, people and systems or \nfrom external events. We use an internal model to calculate the \neconomic capital requirement for operational risk at a 99.97% \nconfidence level and a one-year holding period. A loss distribu-\ntion approach based on historical data on internal and relevant \nexternal losses of peers is used to generate a loss distribution \nfor a range of potential operational risk loss scenarios, such as \nunauthorized trading incidents, business interruption, fraud or \nother material business disruptions. The parameters estimated \nthrough the quantitative model are reviewed by business experts \nand senior management in order to take account of the business \nenvironment and internal control factors and to reflect a forward-\nlooking view in the estimate. The capital calculation also includes \na component to reflect litigation events and insurance mitigation.\n\n152\n\nRisk management\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nPosition risk categories\xc2\xa0\n\xc2\xa0 \nCredit risk\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\nRisks captured\n\xef\x90\x82  Risk of counterparty defaults relating to investment banking credit exposures\n\xef\x90\x82  Risk of counterparty defaults and potential changes in creditworthiness relating to private banking \n\ncorporate and retail credit exposures\n\nNon-traded credit spread risk\xc2\xa0 \nSecuritized products\xc2\xa0 \n\n\xef\x90\x82  Potential changes in creditworthiness relating to investment banking credit exposures\n\xef\x90\x82  Residential real estate activities, including residential mortgage-backed securities, residential mortgage \n\n\xc2\xa0 \n\n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \nTraded risk\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\nloans and real estate acquired at auction\n\n\xef\x90\x82  Commercial real estate activities, including commercial mortgage-backed securities, commercial loans \n\nand real estate acquired at auction\n\n\xef\x90\x82  Other securitized products, including asset-backed securities and other trade receivables\n\xef\x90\x82  Benefits from certain market risk hedges\n\xef\x90\x82  Interest rate levels and volatilities\n\xef\x90\x82  Foreign exchange rates and volatilities\n\xef\x90\x82  Equity prices and volatilities\n\xef\x90\x82  Commodity prices and volatilities\n\xef\x90\x82  Traded credit spreads\n\xef\x90\x82  Equity risk arbitrage activities, in particular, the risk that an announced merger may not be completed\n\xef\x90\x82  Illiquid hedge fund exposures\n\xef\x90\x82  Life finance and litigation business activities\n\xef\x90\x82  Risks currently not implemented in our economic risk capital models for traded risks, primarily for fixed \n\nincome and equity trading, such as certain basis risks, higher order risks and cross risks between \nasset classes\n\nEmerging markets country event risk\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \nEquity investments \n\n\xef\x90\x82  Loss due to significant country events\n\xef\x90\x82  Corporate counterparty defaults triggered by sovereign defaults\n\xef\x90\x82  Risk of related disturbance in neighboring countries or countries in the same region\n\xef\x90\x82  Private equity and other illiquid equity investment exposures\n\nOther risks\nThe other risks category includes the following:\np  Our expense risk measures the potential difference between \nexpenses and revenues in a severe market event, excluding \nthe elements captured by position risk and operational risk, \nusing conservative assumptions regarding the earnings capac-\nity and the ability to reduce the cost base in a crisis situation.\n\np  Pension risk is the risk that we, as a plan sponsor, are required \n\nto fund a deficit in employee pension schemes in an extreme \nevent. It covers fluctuations in our pension plan assets and lia-\nbilities which can lead to potential funding shortfalls. Funding \nshortfalls can arise from a decline in asset values and/or an \nincrease in the present value of liabilities. The shortfall would \nneed to be funded using available resources. In order to recog-\nnize the potential for a funding shortfall, we apply an economic \nrisk capital charge.\n\np  Owned real estate risk is defined as the capital at risk which \narises from fluctuations in the value of buildings owned by the \nGroup. \n\np  Foreign exchange risk is the risk arising from a currency mis-\nmatch between available economic capital and economic risk \ncapital required.\n\np  Corporate interest rate risk is the interest rate risk on our trea-\nsury positions arising from discounting our client interest rate \nmargins.\n\np  The impact from deferred share-based compensation awards \ncaptures the economic benefit that may result from covering \nour structural short obligations to deliver own shares through \nmarket purchases during times of falling market prices.\n\nAvailable economic capital\nAvailable economic capital is an internal view of the capital avail-\nable to absorb losses based on the reported BIS look-through \nCET1 capital under Basel\xc2\xa0III, with economic adjustments applied \nto provide consistency with our economic risk capital. It enables \na comparison between capital needs (economic risk capital) and \ncapital resources (available economic capital). \n\nEconomic risk capital coverage ratio\nEconomic risk capital coverage ratio is defined as the ratio of capi-\ntal available to absorb losses in a \xe2\x80\x9cgone concern\xe2\x80\x9d scenario (avail-\nable economic capital) to capital needs (economic risk capital). The \neconomic risk capital coverage ratio is primarily meant to provide an \nassessment of our solvency and reflects our best internal assess-\nment of risk and loss absorbing capacity in an extreme scenario. \nFurthermore, the economic risk capital coverage ratio is embedded \nin our risk appetite framework through our capital adequacy objec-\ntive. We also plan to incorporate the \xe2\x80\x9cgoing concern\xe2\x80\x9d economic \nrisk capital coverage ratio into our risk appetite and risk manage-\nment frameworks, to supplement the \xe2\x80\x9cgone concern\xe2\x80\x9d coverage ratio \nintroduced in 2015.\n\nThe economic risk capital coverage ratio operates with a num-\nber of distinct bands that serve as key controls for monitoring and \nmanaging our operational solvency. An economic risk capital cov-\nerage ratio lower than 125% requires senior management review, \nfollowed by an action plan at a coverage ratio lower than 110%. \nImmediate actions such as risk reductions or capital measures \nwould be triggered at a coverage ratio lower than 100%. The \nBoard has set the minimum level for this coverage ratio at 80%.\n\nRisk management\n\n153\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nGovernance\nOur economic risk capital framework is governed and main-\ntained by a dedicated steering committee, which regularly reviews, \nassesses and updates the economic risk capital methodology in \nlight of market and regulatory developments, risk management \npractice and organizational changes. In addition, the steering com-\nmittee approves new methodologies and prioritizes the implemen-\ntation for its three components (position risk, operational risk and \nother risks).\n\nStress testing framework\n\nOverview\nStress testing or scenario analysis provides an additional \napproach to risk management and formulates hypothetical ques-\ntions, including what would happen to our portfolio if, for example, \nhistoric or adverse forward-looking events were to occur. A well-\ndeveloped stress testing framework provides a powerful tool for \nsenior management to identify these risks and also take correc-\ntive actions to protect the earnings and capital from undesired \nimpacts. \n\nStress testing is a fundamental element of our Group-wide risk \nappetite framework included in overall risk management to ensure \nthat our financial position and risk profile provide sufficient resil-\nience to withstand the impact of severe economic conditions. \nStress testing results are monitored against limits, and are used \nin risk appetite discussions and strategic business planning and \nto support our internal capital adequacy assessment. Within the \nrisk appetite framework, CARMC sets Group-wide and divisional \nstressed position loss limits to correspond to minimum post-stress \ncapital ratios. Currently, limits are set on the basis of look-through \nBIS CET1 capital ratios. Stress tests also form an integral part of \nthe Group\xe2\x80\x99s capital planning and the recovery and resolution plan \n(RRP) process. Within the RRP, stress tests provide the indicative \nscenario severity required to reach recovery and resolution capital \nlevels.\n\nStress testing provides key inputs for managing the following \nobjectives of the risk appetite framework:\np  Ensuring Group-wide capital adequacy on both a regula-\n\ntory basis and under stressed conditions: We run a suite of \nscenarios on forecasted financial metrics such as revenues, \nexpenses, pre-tax income and risk-weighted assets. The post-\nstress capital ratios are assessed against the risk appetite of \nthe Group.\n\np  Maintaining stable earnings: We mainly use stress testing to \n\nquantitatively assess earnings stability risk. Earnings-loss-trig-\ngers are established and monitored to contain excessive risk-\ntaking which could compromise our earnings stability.\n\nWe also conduct externally defined stress tests that meet the \nspecific requirements of regulators. For example, as part of vari-\nous regular stress tests and analysis, FINMA requires a semi-\nannual loss potential analysis that includes an extreme scenario \nthat sees European countries experience a severe recession \n\n154\n\nRisk management\n\nresulting from the worsening of the European debt crisis as well \nas a scenario focusing on a financial crisis in China and the US. \n\nMethodology and scope of Group-wide stress testing\nStress tests are carried out to determine stressed position losses, \nearnings volatility and stressed capital ratios using historical, \nforward-looking and reverse stress testing scenarios. The scope \nof stress testing includes market, credit default, operational, busi-\nness and pension risk. Stress tests also include the scenario \nimpact on risk-weighted assets through changes to market, credit \nand operational components.\n\nWe use historical stress testing scenarios to consider the impact \nof market shocks from relevant periods of extreme market distur-\nbance. Standardized severity levels allow comparability of severity \nacross differing risk types. The calibration of bad day, bad week, \nsevere event and extreme event scenarios involves the identifi-\ncation of the worst moves that have occurred in recent history. \nSevere flight to quality (SFTQ) is a key scenario used for Group-\nwide stress testing and risk appetite setting. It is a combination of \nmarket shocks and defaults that reflects conditions similar to what \nfollowed the 2008/2009 financial crisis. The SFTQ scenario \nassumes a severe crash across financial markets, along with \nstressed default rates.\n\nWe use forward-looking stress testing scenarios to complement \nhistorical scenarios. The forward-looking scenarios are cen-\ntered on potential macroeconomic, geopolitical or policy threats. \nThe Scenario Management Oversight Committee, comprised of \ninternal economists, front office and representatives of the risk \nmanagement and finance function, discusses the backdrop to \nseveral forward-looking scenarios. The Scenario Management \nOversight Committee reviews a wide range of scenarios and \nselects those that are most relevant to the analysis of key macro-\neconomic shocks. Some examples of forward-looking scenarios \ninclude US and European country recessions, a so-called emerg-\ning markets economic \xe2\x80\x9chard landing\xe2\x80\x9d and the impact of monetary \npolicy changes by central banks. Various scenarios are also used \nto mitigate concentration risks across the entire firm, such as the \ncredit concentration scenario. During 2018, the Group continued \nto focus on the following forward-looking scenarios:\np  Financial sector problems in the eurozone: the markets chal-\nlenge the solvency of a systemically-important bank, which \nputs the overall European financial sector and selected euro-\nzone countries under acute pressure. The European economy \nis forced into recession. Contagion from a European recession \nto the US and emerging market economies is assumed to be \nsubstantial.\n\np  An emerging markets \xe2\x80\x9chard landing\xe2\x80\x9d scenario: there is a severe \n\neconomic slowdown in China driven by a wave of defaults in \nthe private non-financial and financial sectors. The problems \nin China negatively impact all large emerging markets through \nlower commodity prices, increased capital flight and reduced \nintra-regional foreign trade. There is also significant contagion \nto the economy in the US and in Europe.\n\np  Stress scenarios for the UK and for the US: the scenarios \n\ntake into account the large increase in economic policy outlook \n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nuncertainties and the higher risk that inflation significantly \naccelerates, bringing about a disorderly rise in government \nbond yields. The UK stress scenario focuses on the risks \nwhich may materialize from the negotiations on leaving the \nEU. The US stress scenario focuses on the business risks \nwhich may materialize from more expansionary fiscal policies \nand from any shift toward more protectionist foreign trade \npractices.\n\nThe scenarios are reviewed and updated regularly as markets and \nbusiness strategies evolve. In 2018, a one-in-three years likeli-\nhood scenario called \xe2\x80\x9cflight to quality lite\xe2\x80\x9d (FTQ Lite) was devel-\noped to reflect a scenario with a lower severity of impact than \nSFTQ but with a higher likelihood of occurrence. FTQ Lite is used \nto test the earnings robustness of the Group. In addition to these \nperiodic scenario analyses, we also perform ad hoc scenario \nanalyses, for example in respect of the devaluation of the Turkish \nlira in the first half of 2018, in connection with current events as a \nproactive risk management tool.\n\nWe use reverse stress testing scenarios to complement traditional \nstress testing and enhance our understanding of business model \nvulnerabilities. Reverse stress testing scenarios define a range of \nsevere adverse outcomes and identify what could lead to these \noutcomes. The more severe scenarios include large counter-\nparty failures, sudden shifts in market conditions, operational risk \nevents, credit rating downgrades and the shutdown of wholesale \nfunding markets.\n\nGovernance\nOur stress testing framework is comprehensive and governed \nby a dedicated steering committee, the Scenario Steering Com-\nmittee. The Scenario Steering Committee reviews the scenario \nmethodology and approves changes to scenario frameworks. It is \ncomprised of experts in stress methodologies representing vari-\nous risk functions (market risk, liquidity risk, credit risk and opera-\ntional risk) and also represents the Group divisions and major \nlegal entities.\n\nThe Scenario Management Oversight Committee has received \nresponsibility from CARMC for the Group-wide scenario calibra-\ntion and analysis process, including the design of scenarios and \nthe assessment and approval of scenario results. Stress tests are \nconducted on a regular basis and the results, trend information \nand supporting analysis are reported to the Board, senior man-\nagement and regulators.\n\nMarket risk\n\nDefinition\nMarket risk is the risk of financial loss arising from movements in \nmarket risk factors. The movements in market risk factors that \ngenerate financial losses are considered to be adverse changes in \ninterest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, equity and \ncommodity prices and other factors, such as market volatility and \nthe correlation of market prices across asset classes. A typical \ntransaction or position in financial instruments may be exposed to \n\na number of different market risk factors. Our trading portfolios \n(trading book) and non-trading portfolios (banking book) have dif-\nferent sources of market risk.\n\nSources of market risk\nMarket risks arise from both our trading and non-trading business \nactivities. The classification of assets and liabilities into trading \nbook and banking book portfolios determines the approach for \nanalyzing our market risk exposure. This classification reflects the \nbusiness and risk management perspective with respect to trad-\ning intent, and may be different from the classification of these \nassets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes. \n\nTrading book\nMarket risks from our trading book relate to our trading activities, \nprimarily in Global Markets (which includes International Trad-\ning Solutions), Asia Pacific and the Strategic Resolution Unit. \nOur trading book, as measured for risk management purposes, \ntypically includes fair-valued positions only, primarily of the fol-\nlowing balance sheet items: trading assets and trading liabilities, \ninvestment securities, other investments, other assets (mainly \nderivatives used for hedging, loans and real estate held-for-sale), \nshort-term borrowings, long-term debt and other liabilities (mainly \nderivatives used for hedging). \n\nWe are active globally in the principal trading markets, using a \nwide range of trading and hedging products, including derivatives \nand structured products. Structured products are customized \ntransactions often using combinations of derivatives and are exe-\ncuted to meet specific client or internal needs. As a result of our \nbroad participation in products and markets, our trading strategies \nare correspondingly diverse and exposures are generally spread \nacross a range of risks and locations. \n\nThe market risks associated with the entire portfolio, including \nthe embedded derivative elements of our structured products, are \nactively monitored and managed on a portfolio basis as part of \nour overall trading book and are reflected in our VaR measures.\n\nBanking book\nMarket risks from our banking book primarily relate to asset and \nliability mismatch exposures, equity participations and invest-\nments in bonds and money market instruments. Our businesses \nand the treasury function have non-trading portfolios that carry \nmarket risks, mainly related to changes in interest rates but also \nto changes in foreign exchange rates, equity prices and, to a \nlesser extent, commodity prices. Our banking book, as measured \nfor risk management purposes, includes a majority of the follow-\ning balance sheet items: loans, central bank funds sold, securi-\nties purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowing \ntransactions, cash and due from banks, brokerage receivables, \ndue to banks, customer deposits, central bank funds purchased, \nsecurities sold under repurchase agreements and securities lend-\ning transactions, brokerage payables, selected positions of short-\nterm borrowings and long-term debt, hedging instruments and \nother assets and liabilities not included in the trading portfolio.\n\nRisk management\n\n155\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nWe assume interest rate risks in our banking book through lend-\ning and deposit-taking, money market and funding activities, \nand the deployment of our consolidated equity as well as other \nactivities, including market making and trading activities involving \nbanking book positions at the divisional level. Savings accounts \nand many other retail banking products have no contractual matu-\nrity date or direct market-linked interest rate and are risk-man-\naged on a pooled basis using replication portfolios on behalf of \nour private banking, corporate and institutional businesses. The \nreplication portfolios approximate the interest rate characteristics \nof the underlying products. This particular source of market risk is \nmonitored on a daily basis. \n\nThe majority of non-trading foreign exchange risk is associated \nwith our net investment in foreign branches, subsidiaries and \naffiliates denominated in currencies other than Swiss francs. This \nexposure is actively managed to hedge our capital and leverage \nratios and is governed within our risk appetite framework.\n\nEvaluation and management of market risk\nWe use market risk measurement and management methods \ncapable of calculating comparable exposures across our many \nactivities and employ focused tools that can model unique char-\nacteristics of certain instruments or portfolios. The tools are used \nfor internal market risk management, internal market risk report-\ning and external disclosure purposes. Our principal market risk \nmeasurement for the trading book is VaR. In addition, our market \nrisk exposures are reflected in scenario analysis, as included in \nour stress testing framework, position risk, as included in our \neconomic risk capital, and sensitivity analysis. Each market risk \nmeasurement aims to estimate the potential loss that we can \nincur due to an adverse market movement with varying degrees \nof severity. VaR, scenario analysis, position risk and sensitiv-\nity analysis complement each other in our market risk assess-\nment and are used to measure market risk at the Group level. Our \nrisk management practices are regularly reviewed to ensure they \nremain appropriate.\n\nThe Group\xe2\x80\x99s overall limit framework encompasses specific limits \non a large number of different products and risk type concentra-\ntions at the Group, divisional and legal entity levels. For example, \nthere are controls over consolidated trading exposures, the mis-\nmatch of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, \nprivate equity and seed capital. Risk limits are cascaded to lower \norganizational levels within the businesses. Risk limits are bind-\ning and generally set close to the planned risk profile to ensure \nthat any meaningful increase in risk exposures is promptly esca-\nlated. The Group\xe2\x80\x99s Organizational Guidelines and Regulations and \nthe Group\xe2\x80\x99s policies determine limit-setting authority, tempo-\nrary modification of such limits in certain situations and required \napproval authority at the Group, Bank, divisional, business and \nlegal entity levels for any instances that could cause such limits \nto be exceeded. For example, with respect to market risk limits, \nthe divisional chief risk officers and certain other members of \nsenior management have the authority to temporarily increase \nthe divisional risk committee limits by an approved percentage \nfor a specified maximum period. Market risk limit excesses are \n\n156\n\nRisk management\n\nsubject to a formal escalation procedure and the incremental risk \nassociated with the excess must be approved by the responsi-\nble risk manager within market risk management, with escala-\ntion to senior management if certain thresholds are exceeded. \nThe majority of the market risk limits are monitored on a daily \nbasis. Limits for which the inherent calculation time is longer or \nfor which the risk profile changes less often are monitored less \nfrequently depending on the nature of the limit (weekly, monthly \nor quarterly). For example, limits relating to illiquid investments \nare monitored on a monthly basis. The business is mandated to \nremediate market risk limit excesses within three business days \nupon notification. Remediation actions which take longer than \nthree days are subject to an out-of-policy remediation process \nwith senior management escalation. All limit excesses identified in \n2018 were resolved in line with applicable policy requirements.\n\nFor the purpose of this disclosure, market risk in the trading book \nis mainly measured using VaR and market risk in our banking \nbook is mainly measured using sensitivity analysis on related mar-\nket factors.\n\nValue-at-risk\nVaR is a risk measure which quantifies the potential loss on a \ngiven portfolio of financial instruments over a certain holding \nperiod and that is expected to occur at a certain confidence level. \nVaR can be calculated for all financial instruments with adequate \nprice histories. Positions are aggregated by risk category rather \nthan by product. For example, interest rate risk VaR captures \npotential losses driven by fluctuations of interest rates affecting \na wide variety of interest rate products (such as interest rate and \nforeign exchange swaps or swaptions) as well as other products \n(such as foreign exchange, equity and commodity options) for \nwhich interest rate risk is not the primary market risk driver. The \nuse of VaR allows the comparison of risk across different busi-\nnesses. It also provides a means of aggregating and netting a \nvariety of positions within a portfolio to reflect actual correlations \nbetween different assets, applying the concept of portfolio diver-\nsification benefit described above for position risk. Our VaR model \nis designed to take into account a comprehensive set of risk fac-\ntors across all asset classes.\n\nVaR is an important tool in risk management and is used for mea-\nsuring quantifiable risks from our activities exposed to market risk \non a daily basis. In addition, VaR is one of the main risk measures \nfor limit monitoring, financial reporting, calculation of regulatory \ncapital and regulatory backtesting.\n\nOur VaR model is predominantly based on historical simulation \nwhich derives plausible future trading losses from the analysis of \nhistorical movements in market risk factors. The model is respon-\nsive to changes in market conditions through the use of expo-\nnential weighting, which applies a greater weight to more recent \nevents, and the use of expected shortfall equivalent measures to \nensure all extreme adverse events are considered in the model. \nWe use the same VaR model for risk management (including limit \nmonitoring and financial reporting), regulatory capital calculation \nand regulatory backtesting purposes, although confidence level, \n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nholding period and the scope of financial instruments considered \ncan be different. \n\nFor our risk management VaR, we use a two-year historical data-\nset, a one-day holding period and a 98% confidence level. This \nmeans that we would expect daily mark-to-market trading losses \nto exceed the reported VaR not more than twice in 100 trading \ndays over a multi-year observation period. This measure captures \nrisks in trading books only and includes securitization positions. \nIt is closely aligned to the way we consider the risks associated \nwith our trading activities and to the way we measure regulatory \nVaR for capital purposes. For internal risk management and limit \nmonitoring purposes we add certain banking book positions to \nthe scope of the risk management VaR calculation.\n\nFor regulatory capital purposes, we operate under the Basel\xc2\xa0III \nmarket risk framework which includes the following components \nfor the calculation of regulatory capital: regulatory VaR, stressed \nVaR, IRC, RNIV and stressed RNIV. The regulatory VaR for capi-\ntal purposes uses a two-year historical dataset, a ten-day holding \nperiod and a 99% confidence level. This measure captures all \nrisks in the trading book and foreign exchange and commodity \nrisks in the banking book and excludes securitization positions, as \nthese are treated under the securitization approach for regulatory \npurposes. Stressed VaR replicates the regulatory VaR calcula-\ntion on the Group\xe2\x80\x99s current portfolio over a continuous one-year \nobservation period that results in the highest VaR. The histori-\ncal dataset starting in 2006 avoids the smoothing effect of the \ntwo-year dataset used for our risk management and regulatory \nVaR, allows for the capturing of a longer history of potential loss \nevents and helps reduce the pro-cyclicality of the minimum capital \nrequirements for market risk. IRC is a regulatory capital charge \nfor default and migration risk on positions in the trading books. \nRNIV captures a variety of risks, such as certain basis risks, \nhigher order risks and cross risks between asset classes, not cur-\nrently captured by the VaR model for example due to lack of suf-\nficient or accurate data.\n\nBacktesting VaR uses a two-year historical dataset, a one-day \nholding period and a 99% confidence level. This measure cap-\ntures risks in the trading book and includes securitization posi-\ntions. Backtesting VaR is not a component used for the calcula-\ntion of regulatory capital but may have an impact through the \nregulatory capital multiplier if the number of backtesting excep-\ntions exceeds regulatory thresholds.\n\nAssumptions used in our market risk measurement methods for \nregulatory capital purposes are compliant with the standards pub-\nlished by the BCBS and other international standards for market \nrisk management. We have approval from FINMA, as well as \nfrom other regulators for our subsidiaries, to use our regulatory \nVaR model in the calculation of market risk capital requirements. \nOngoing enhancements to our VaR methodology are subject to \nregulatory approval or notification depending on their materiality, \nand the model is subject to regular reviews by regulators and the \nGroup\xe2\x80\x99s independent model risk management function.\n\nInformation required under Pillar\xc2\xa03 of the Basel framework related \nto risk is available on our website.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9ccredit-suisse.com/regulatorydisclosures\xe2\x80\x9d for further information.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cRisk-weighted assets\xe2\x80\x9d in Capital management for further information \non the use of our regulatory VaR model in the calculation of trading book mar-\nket risk capital requirements.\n\nVaR assumptions and limitations\nThe VaR model uses assumptions and estimates that we believe \nare reasonable, but VaR only quantifies the potential loss on a \nportfolio based on historical market conditions. The main assump-\ntions and limitations of VaR as a risk measure are:\np  VaR relies on historical data to estimate future changes in \nmarket conditions. Historical scenarios may not capture all \npotential future outcomes, particularly where there are signifi-\ncant changes in market conditions, such as increases in vola-\ntilities and changes in the correlation of market prices across \nasset classes;\n\np  VaR provides an estimate of losses at a specified confidence \n\nlevel; the use of an expected shortfall equivalent measure \nallows all extreme adverse events to be considered in the \nmodel;\n\np  VaR is based on either a one-day (for internal risk manage-\n\nment, backtesting and disclosure purposes) or a ten-day (for \nregulatory capital purposes) holding period. This assumes that \nrisks can be either sold or hedged over the holding period, \nwhich may not be possible for all types of exposure, particu-\nlarly during periods of market illiquidity or turbulence; it also \nassumes that risks will remain in existence over the entire \nholding period; and\n\np  VaR is calculated using positions held at the end of each busi-\nness day and does not include intra-day changes in exposures.\n\nTo mitigate some of the VaR limitations and estimate losses asso-\nciated with unusually severe market movements, we use other \nmetrics designed for risk management purposes and described \nabove, including stressed VaR, position risk and scenario analysis.\n\nFor some risk types there can be insufficient historical data for \na calculation within the Group\xe2\x80\x99s VaR model. This often happens \nbecause underlying instruments may have traded only for a lim-\nited time. Where we do not have sufficient market data, either \nmarket data proxies or extreme parameter moves for these risk \ntypes are used. Market data proxies are selected to be as close \nto the underlying instrument as possible. Where neither a suitable \nmarket dataset nor a close proxy is available, extreme parameter \nmoves are used. \n\nWe use a risk factor identification process to ensure that risks are \nidentified and measured correctly. There are two parts to this pro-\ncess. First, the market data dependency approach systematically \ndetermines the risk requirements based on data inputs used by \nfront-office pricing models and compares this with the risk types \nthat are captured by the Group\xe2\x80\x99s VaR model and the RNIV frame-\nwork. Second, the product-based approach is a qualitative analy-\nsis of product types undertaken in order to identify the risk types \nthat those product types would be exposed to. A comparison is \n\nRisk management\n\n157\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nagain made with the risk types that are captured in the VaR and \nRNIV frameworks. This process identifies risks that are not yet \ncaptured in the VaR model or the RNIV framework. A plan for \nincluding these risks in one or the other framework can then be \ndevised. RNIV is captured in our economic risk capital framework.\n\nVaR backtesting\nBacktesting is one of the techniques used to assess the accu-\nracy and performance of the VaR model used by the Group for \nrisk management and regulatory capital purposes and serves to \nhighlight areas of potential enhancements. Backtesting is used by \nregulators to assess the adequacy of regulatory capital held by the \nGroup, calculated using VaR. \n\nBacktesting involves comparing the results produced by the VaR \nmodel with the hypothetical trading revenues on the trading book. \nHypothetical trading revenues are defined in compliance with \nregulatory requirements and aligned with the VaR model output \nby excluding (i)\xc2\xa0non-market elements (such as fees, commissions, \ncancellations and terminations, net cost of funding and credit-\nrelated valuation adjustments) and (ii)\xc2\xa0gains and losses from intra-\nday trading. A backtesting exception occurs when a hypothetical \ntrading loss exceeds the daily VaR estimate.\n\nFor capital purposes and in line with BIS requirements, FINMA \nincreases the capital multiplier for every regulatory VaR back-\ntesting exception above four in the prior rolling 12-month period, \nresulting in an incremental market risk capital requirement for the \nGroup. VaR models with less than five backtesting exceptions \nare considered by regulators to be classified in a defined \xe2\x80\x9cgreen \nzone\xe2\x80\x9d. The \xe2\x80\x9cgreen zone\xe2\x80\x9d corresponds to backtesting results that \ndo not themselves suggest a problem with the quality or accuracy \nof a bank\xe2\x80\x99s model.\n\nVaR governance\nLike other models, our VaR model is subject to internal governance \nincluding validation by a team of modeling experts independent \nfrom the model developers. Validation includes identifying and \ntesting the model\xe2\x80\x99s assumptions and limitations, investigating its \nperformance through historical and potential future stress events, \nand testing that the live implementation of the model behaves as \nintended. We employ a range of different control processes to help \nensure that the models used for market risk remain appropriate \nover time. As part of these control processes, a dedicated Market \nRisk Quantitative Steering Committee meets regularly to review \nmodel performance and approve any new or amended models.\n\nSensitivity analysis\nMarket risks associated with our banking book positions are \nmeasured, monitored and limited using several tools, including \neconomic risk capital, scenario analysis, sensitivity analysis and \nVaR. For the purpose of this disclosure, the aggregated market \nrisks associated with our banking book positions are measured \nusing sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis is a technique used \nto determine how different values of an independent variable \n\nwill impact a particular dependent variable under a given set of \nassumptions. The sensitivity analysis for the banking book posi-\ntions measures the potential change in economic value resulting \nfrom specified hypothetical shocks to market factors (e.g., inter-\nest rates). It is not a measure of the potential impact on reported \nearnings in the current period, since the banking book posi-\ntions generally are not marked to market through the income \nstatement.\n\nCredit and debit valuation adjustments\nCredit valuation adjustments are modifications to the measure-\nment of derivative assets used to reflect the credit risk of counter-\nparties. Debit valuation adjustments are modifications to the mea-\nsurement of derivative liabilities used to reflect an entity\xe2\x80\x99s own \ncredit risk. VaR excludes the impact of changes in both counter-\nparty and our own credit spreads on derivative products.\n\nCredit risk\n\nDefinition\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss arising as a result of a bor-\nrower or counterparty failing to meet its financial obligations or \nas a result of deterioration in the credit quality of the borrower or \ncounterparty. In the event of a default, a bank generally incurs a \nloss equal to the amount owed by the debtor, less any recover-\nies from foreclosure, liquidation of collateral, the restructuring of \nthe debtor company or other recovery proceeds from the debtor. \nA change in the credit quality of a counterparty has an impact \non the valuation of assets measured at fair value, with valuation \nchanges recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\nSources of credit risk\nCredit risk arises from the execution of our business strategy in \nthe divisions and reflects exposures directly held in the form of \nlending products (including loans and credit guarantees) or deriva-\ntives, shorter-term exposures such as underwriting commitments, \nand settlement risk related to the exchange of cash or securities \noutside of typical delivery versus payment structures. For the divi-\nsions, the main sources of credit risk are presented in the table \n\xe2\x80\x9cSources of credit risk by division\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nEvaluation and management of credit risk\nWe use a credit risk management framework which provides for \nthe consistent evaluation, measurement, and management of \ncredit risk across the Group. Assessment of credit risk exposures \nfor internal risk estimates and risk-weighted assets are calculated \nbased on PD, LGD and EAD models approved by our main regu-\nlators. The credit risk framework incorporates the following core \nelements:\np  counterparty and transaction assessments: application of \n\ninternal credit ratings (PD), assignment of LGD and EAD val-\nues in relation to counterparties and transactions;\n\np  credit limits: establishment of credit limits, subject to approval \n\nby delegated authority holders, to serve as primary risk con-\ntrols on exposures and to prevent undue risk concentrations;\n\n158\n\nRisk management\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nSources of credit risk by division\xc2\xa0\nDivision\xc2\xa0 \nSwiss Universal Bank\xc2\xa0 \nInternational Wealth Management\xc2\xa0 \nAsia Pacific\xc2\xa0 \nGlobal Markets\xc2\xa0 \n\nInvestment Banking & Capital Markets\xc2\xa0 \nStrategic Resolution Unit\xc2\xa01 \nCorporate Center \n\nMain sources of credit risk\nLending against real estate and financial collateral as well as commercial lending and consumer finance\nLending against real assets (e.g., real estate, ships, aircraft) and financial collateral\nLending to corporate clients and lending to private clients against real estate and financial collateral\nCorporate lending, derivatives and securities financing activities with institutional clients and \ncounterparties, and asset finance\nLoan underwriting commitments and corporate lending\nLegacy lending and derivatives exposures\nMoney market exposures through balance sheet management\n\n1 Beginning in 2019, the Strategic Resolution Unit has ceased to exist as a separate division of the Group. The residual portfolio remaining as of December 31, 2018 is now managed in an \n\nAsset Resolution Unit and will be separately disclosed within the Corporate Center.\n\np  risk mitigation: active management of risk mitigation provided \n\nin relation to credit exposures, including through the use of \ncash sales, participations, collateral or guarantees or hedging \ninstruments; and\n\np  credit monitoring, impairments and provisions: processes to \nsupport the ongoing monitoring and management of credit \nexposures, supporting the early identification of deterioration \nand any subsequent impact.\n\nCounterparty and transaction assessments\nWe evaluate and assess counterparties and clients to whom \nwe have credit exposures, primarily using internal rating models \nthat have been approved by our main regulators. We use these \nmodels to determine internal credit ratings which are intended to \nreflect the PD of each counterparty. For a majority of counterpar-\nties and clients, internal ratings are based on internally developed \nstatistical models which are backtested against internal experi-\nence, validated by a function independent of model development, \nand approved by our main regulators for application in the regula-\ntory capital calculation under the A-IRB approach of the Basel \nframework. Findings from backtesting serve as a key input for \nany future rating model developments.\n\nInternal statistical rating models are based on a combination of \nquantitative factors (e.g., financial fundamentals and market data) \nand qualitative factors (e.g., credit history and economic trends).\n\nFor the remaining counterparties where statistical rating models \nare not used, internal credit ratings are assigned on the basis of a \nstructured expert approach using a variety of inputs such as peer \nanalyses, industry comparisons, external ratings and research as \nwell as the judgment of expert credit officers.\n\nIn addition to counterparty ratings, credit risk management also \nassesses the risk profile of individual transactions and assigns \ntransaction ratings which reflect specific contractual terms such \nas seniority, security and collateral.\n\nInternal credit ratings may differ from external credit ratings, \nwhere available, and are subject to periodic review. Our internal \nratings are mapped to a PD band associated with each rating \nwhich is calibrated to historical default experience using inter-\nnal data and external data sources. Our internal masterscale for \ncredit ratings is shown in the table \xe2\x80\x9cCredit Suisse counterparty \nratings\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nLGD estimates the size of loss that may arise on a credit expo-\nsure in the event of a default. We assign LGD on credit exposures \nbased on the structure of the transaction and credit mitigation \nsuch as collateral or guarantees. The LGD values are calibrated \nto reflect a downturn macroeconomic environment and include \nrecovery costs.\n\nEAD represents the expected amount of credit exposure in the \nevent of a default and reflects the current drawn exposure and an \nexpectation regarding the future evolution of the credit exposure. \nFor loan exposures, a credit conversion factor is applied to project \nthe additional drawn amount between current utilization and the \napproved facility amount.

Credit hedging contracts are typically bilateral \nor centrally cleared derivative transactions and are subject to col-\nlateralized trading arrangements. We evaluate hedging risk mitiga-\ntion to ensure that basis or tenor risk is appropriately identified and \nmanaged.\n\nRisk mitigation\nWe actively manage our credit exposure by taking financial and \nnon-financial collateral supported by enforceable legal documen-\ntation, as well as by utilizing credit hedging techniques. Financial \ncollateral in the form of cash, marketable securities (e.g., equities, \nbonds or funds) and guarantees serves to mitigate the inher-\nent risk of credit loss and to improve recoveries in the event of \na default. Financial collateral is subject to controls on eligibility \nand is supported by frequent market valuation depending on the \nasset class to ensure exposures remain adequately collateralized. \nDepending on the quality of the collateral, appropriate haircuts \nare applied for risk management purposes.\n\nIn addition to collateral and hedging strategies, we also actively \nmanage our loan portfolio and may sell or sub-participate positions \nin the loan portfolio as a further form of risk mitigation.\n\nCredit monitoring, impairments and provisions\nA rigorous credit quality monitoring process provides an early \nidentification of possible changes in the creditworthiness of cli-\nents and includes regular asset and collateral quality reviews, \nbusiness and financial statement analysis, and relevant economic \nand industry studies. Regularly updated watch lists and review \nmeetings are used for the identification of counterparties that \ncould be subject to adverse changes in creditworthiness.\n\nNon-financial collateral such as residential and commercial real \nestate, tangible assets (e.g., ships or aircraft), inventories and com-\nmodities are valued at the time of credit approval and periodically \nthereafter depending on the type of credit exposure and collateral \ncoverage ratio.\n\nIn addition to collateral, we also utilize credit hedging in the form of \nprotection provided by single-name and index credit default swaps \nas well as structured hedging and insurance products. Credit hedg-\ning is used to mitigate risks arising from the loan portfolio, loan \nunderwriting exposures and counterparty credit risk. Hedging is \nintended to reduce the risk of loss from a specific counterparty \ndefault or broader downturn in markets that impact the overall \n\nIn the event of a default, credit exposures are transferred to recov-\nery management functions within credit risk management and are \nsubject to formal reporting to the quarterly recovery review commit-\ntee. Changes in the exposure profile and expectations for recovery \nform the basis to determine the allowance for credit losses which \nare discussed with the Group chief credit officer. Any decision to \nmake full or partial write-offs require the approval of the Group \nchief credit officer.\n\nThe review of the credit quality of clients and counterparties does \nnot depend on the accounting treatment of the asset or commit-\nment. Our credit portfolio & provisions review committee regularly \nreviews the appropriateness of allowances for credit losses. \n\n160\n\nRisk management\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nChanges in the credit quality of loans held at fair value are reflected \nin valuation changes recorded directly in revenues, and therefore \nare not part of the impaired loans balance which only includes \nloans valued on an amortized cost basis. Impaired transactions are \nfurther classified as potential problem exposure, non-performing \nexposure, non-interest-earning exposure or restructured exposure, \nand the exposures are generally managed within credit recovery \nunits.\n\nWe maintain specific valuation allowances on loans valued at \namortized cost, which we consider a reasonable estimate of \nlosses identified in the existing credit portfolio. We provide for loan \nlosses based on a regular and detailed analysis of all counterpar-\nties, taking collateral value into consideration, where applicable. If \nuncertainty exists as to the repayment of either principal or inter-\nest, a specific valuation allowance is either created or adjusted \naccordingly. The specific allowance for loan losses is revalued by \nGroup credit risk management at least annually or more frequently \ndepending on the risk profile of the borrower or credit-relevant \nevents.\n\nAn inherent loss allowance is estimated for all loans not specifically \nidentified as impaired and that, on a portfolio basis, are considered \nto contain inherent losses. The method for determining the inher-\nent loss in the lending portfolios of Global Markets and Investment \nBanking & Capital Markets is based on a market-implied model \nusing long-term industry-wide historical default and recovery data \ntaking into account the credit rating and industry of each counter-\nparty. A separate component of the calculation reflects the current \nmarket conditions in the allowance for loan losses. Depending on \nthe nature of the exposures, this method may also be applied for \nthe lending portfolios in Swiss Universal Bank, International Wealth \nManagement, Asia Pacific and the Strategic Resolution Unit. For all \nother exposures, inherent losses in the lending portfolios of these \ndivisions are determined based on current internal risk ratings, col-\nlateral and exposure structure, applying historical default and loss \nexperience in the ratings and loss parameters. Qualitative adjust-\nments to reflect current market conditions or any other factors not \ncaptured by the model are approved by management and reflected \nin the allowance for loan losses. A provision for inherent losses on \noff-balance sheet lending-related exposure, such as contingent \nliabilities and irrevocable commitments, is also determined, using a \nmethodology similar to that used for the loan portfolio.\n\nCredit risk governance\nCredit risk is managed and controlled by Group credit risk man-\nagement, an independent function within the risk management \narea and governed by a comprehensive framework of policies \nand procedures. Key processes are reviewed through supervisory \nchecks on a regular basis by credit risk management, including \nthe Group chief credit officer.\n\nThe Group chief credit officer has established an executive gover-\nnance and change committee to support overall management and \n\noversight of the credit risk management function. The committee \nis comprised of senior personnel of key functions within credit risk \nmanagement and divisional chief credit officers. The governance \nframework is based on a committee structure covering key areas \nof the credit risk framework including the credit risk appetite com-\nmittee, credit risk policy committee, credit risk controls committee \nand various project and change related governance committees. \nThe governance framework ensures appropriate oversight of the \nglobal credit risk management function and the maintenance of \nrequired global standards for the management of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s credit \nexposure.\n\nCredit risk review\nGovernance and supervisory checks within credit risk manage-\nment are supplemented by the credit risk review function. The \ncredit risk review function is independent from credit risk man-\nagement with a direct functional reporting line to the Risk Com-\nmittee Chair, administratively reporting to the Group CRO. Credit \nrisk review\xe2\x80\x99s primary responsibility is to provide timely and inde-\npendent assessments of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s credit exposures and credit \nrisk management processes and practices. Any findings and \nagreed actions are reported to senior management and, as nec-\nessary, to the Risk Committee.\n\nModel risk\n\nLike most other financial firms, we rely on advanced quantita-\ntive models across all business lines and legal entities to support \na broad range of applications, including estimating various forms \nof financial risk, valuation of securities, stress testing, assessing \ncapital adequacy, providing wealth management services to cli-\nents and to meet various reporting requirements.\n\nDefinition and sources of model risk\nModel risk is the risk of adverse consequences from decisions \nmade based on model results that may be incorrect, misin-\nterpreted or used inappropriately. All quantitative models are \nimperfect approximations that are subject to varying degrees of \nuncertainty in their output depending on, among other factors, \nthe model\xe2\x80\x99s complexity and its intended application. As a result, \nmodeling errors are unavoidable and can result in inappropriate \nbusiness decisions, financial loss, regulatory and reputational risk \nand incorrect or inadequate capital reporting. Model errors, intrin-\nsic uncertainty and inappropriate use are the primary contributors \nto aggregate, Group-wide model risk.\n\nEvaluation and management of model risk\nThrough our global model risk management and governance \nframework we seek to identify, measure and mitigate all sig-\nnificant risks arising from the use of models embedded within \nour global model ecosystem. Model risks can then be mitigated \nthrough a well-designed and robust model risk management \nframework, encompassing both model governance policies and \nprocedures in combination with model validation best practices.\n\nRisk management\n\n161\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nRobust model risk management is crucial to ensuring that the \nGroup\xe2\x80\x99s model risk is assessed and managed in order to remain \nwithin a defined model risk appetite by focusing on identifica-\ntion, measurement and resolution of model limitations. Under \nthe Group\xe2\x80\x99s model governance policies, the model risk manage-\nment function validates and approves all new models and material \nchanges to existing models before their implementation, in compli-\nance with standards established by regulators. Developers, owners \nand model supervisors are responsible for identifying, develop-\ning, implementing and testing their models. Model supervisors \nare responsible for ensuring that models are submitted to model \nrisk management for validation and approval and entered into the \nGroup\xe2\x80\x99s model inventory. The model risk management function is \nstructured to be independent from model users, developers and \nsupervisors.\n\nA rigorous validation practice should ensure that models are \nconceptually sound, correctly implemented by the model own-\ners and developers and functioning as intended. To accomplish \nthis, model risk management deploys a team of objective, well-\ninformed subject matter experts (the model validators) who have \nthe necessary skills and knowledge to pose effective challenge \nto all classes of models as a guiding principle for mitigating model \nrisk.\n\nUnder the Group model governance policies, all models are risk-\ntiered according to an internal scoring method that combines \ncomplexity and materiality to assign models into one of four risk \ntiers. These rating tiers are used to prioritize models and allo-\ncate resources for initial validations, annual reviews and ongoing \nmonitoring.\n\nGovernance\nGovernance is an important part of model risk management. \nVarious model review committees within model risk manage-\nment prepare aggregate model risk reports that serve to identify \nconcentrations of model risk and to make recommendations for \nremediation. These reports are submitted regularly to a dedicated \nmodel risk governance committee which escalates issues as nec-\nessary to the Group\xe2\x80\x99s Model Risk Steering Committee and the \nBoard\xe2\x80\x99s Risk Committee.\n\nModel risk management reviews models annually, reports model \nlimitations to key stakeholders, tracks remediation plans for vali-\ndation findings and reports on model risk tolerance and metrics to \nsenior management. Model risk management oversees controls \nto support a complete and accurate Group-wide model inventory \nand performs annual attestations affirming the completeness and \naccuracy of its model inventory.\n\nOperational and compliance risk\n\nThe Group is required to have an adequate and effective risk and \ncontrol framework in place to manage operational and compli-\nance risks. Building on established, independent operational and \ncompliance risk frameworks, the ERCF further integrates these \nframeworks and harmonizes the related processes in the Group \n\n162\n\nRisk management\n\nrecognizing the commonality and prevalence of operational and \ncompliance risk in the non-financial risk domain. The ERCF estab-\nlishes a consistent, unified approach to non-financial risk and control \nidentification and assessment and sets common minimum standards \nacross the Group for each key component with regard to processes \nand the policy framework.\n\nOperational risk\nOperational risk is the risk of financial loss arising from inadequate \nor failed internal processes, people or systems, or from external \nevents. Operational risk does not include strategic and reputational \nrisks. However, some operational risks can lead to reputational \nissues and as such operational and reputational risks may be closely \nlinked.\n\nOperational risk is inherent in most aspects of our business, \nincluding the systems and processes that support our activities. It \ncomprises a large number of disparate risks that can manifest in \na variety of ways. Examples of operational risk include the risk of \ndamage to physical assets, business disruption, failures relating to \nthird-party processes, data integrity and trade processing, cyber \nattacks and fraudulent or unauthorized transactions. Operational \nrisk can arise from human error, inappropriate conduct, failures in \nsystems, processes and controls, deliberate attack or natural and \nman-made disasters. \n\nIn addition to managing and mitigating operational risks under the \nERCF through business- and risk-related processes and organi-\nzation as described below under \xe2\x80\x9cThe enterprise risk and control \nframework\xe2\x80\x9d, we also transfer the risk of potential loss from certain \noperational risks to third-party insurance companies in certain \ninstances.\n\nCompliance and regulatory risk\nCompliance and regulatory risk is the risk from the failure to comply \nwith laws, regulations, rules or market standards that may have a \nnegative effect on our franchise and clients we serve. It includes \nthe risk that changes in laws, regulations, rules or market standards \nmay limit our activities and have a negative effect on our business \nor our ability to implement strategic initiatives, or can result in an \nincrease in operating costs for the business or make our products \nand services more expensive for clients. Examples of sources of \ncompliance risks include cross-border activities, the risk of money \nlaundering, improper handling of confidential information, conflicts \nof interest, improper gifts and entertainment and failure in duties to \nclients. \n\nThe enterprise risk and control framework\nTo effectively manage operational and compliance risks, the \nGroup-wide ERCF was introduced in 2016 focusing on the early \nidentification, recording, assessment, monitoring, prevention and \nmitigation of these risks, as well as timely and meaningful man-\nagement reporting. Over the past three years, we have further \nimproved the integration of previously separate operational risk \nprocesses, providing a more coherent and systematic approach \nto managing all aspects of the operational risk landscape. Under \nthe ERCF, we integrated the operational risk framework and all of \n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nits components with the compliance risk components to further \nharmonize our approach to non-financial risk. The assessment \nprocesses for operational and compliance risks are closely coordi-\nnated, resulting in an enhanced risk and control self-assessment \n(RCSA) that covers both risk types in a more consistent man-\nner. Also, standardized Group-wide role descriptions define the \nresponsibilities for identifying, assessing, reporting and managing \nrisks across the organization. In 2018, continued progress was \nmade in rolling out a systematic key control activities framework \nas part of the ERCF. This framework applies consistent standards \nand approaches to the identification, documentation and assess-\nment of key controls across the Group.\n\nThe ERCF provides a structured approach to managing opera-\ntional and compliance risks. It seeks to apply consistent standards \nand techniques for evaluating risks across the Group while provid-\ning individual businesses with sufficient flexibility to tailor specific \ncomponents to their own needs, as long as they meet Group-\nwide minimum standards. The main components of the ERCF are \ndescribed below: \n\nGovernance and policies are fundamental to the ERCF. Effec-\ntive governance processes establish clear roles and responsi-\nbilities for managing operational and compliance risk and define \nappropriate escalation processes for outcomes that are outside \nexpected levels. We utilize a comprehensive set of policies and \nprocedures that set out how employees are expected to conduct \ntheir activities.\np  Each business area takes responsibility for its operational and \n\ncompliance risks and the provision of adequate resources \nand procedures for the management of those risks. Busi-\nnesses are supported by designated second line of defense \noperational risk and compliance teams that are responsible for \nindependent risk oversight, methodologies, tools and reporting \nwithin their areas as well as working with management on any \noperational and compliance risk issues that arise. Businesses \n\nand relevant control functions meet regularly to discuss opera-\ntional and compliance risk issues and identify required actions \nto mitigate risks.\n\np  The operational risk management and compliance functions \n\nare jointly responsible for setting minimum standards with \npolicies and procedures for operational and compliance risks. \nThis includes ensuring the cohesiveness of policies, tools and \npractices throughout the Group particularly with regard to the \nidentification, evaluation, mitigation, monitoring and reporting \nof these risks.\n\np  Operational and compliance risk exposures, metrics, issues \nand remediation efforts are discussed at quarterly CARMC \nmeetings of the internal control system cycle and at divisional \noperational risk and compliance management committee \nmeetings, which have senior representatives from all relevant \nfunctions.\n\nERCF risk appetite determines our approach to risk-taking and \narticulates the motivations for taking, accepting or avoiding cer-\ntain types of risks or exposures. Senior management expresses \ntheir operational and compliance risk appetite in terms of quan-\ntitative tolerance levels that apply to operational risk incidents \n(which may also arise due to compliance issues) and qualitative \nstatements covering outcomes that should be avoided. Senior \nmanagement also defines market area and client risk appetites. \nIn 2018, we further enhanced our conduct risk appetite. The risk \nappetites are defined with the relevant risk management com-\nmittees in agreement with the operational risk management and \ncompliance functions.\n\nERCF risk taxonomy represents a unified and standardized cat-\nalogue of inherent non-financial risk definitions across operational \nand compliance risk. It provides a consistent approach to the \nidentification and classification of these risks across the Group.\n\nEnterprise risk and control framework (ERCF)\n\ne\ns\nn\ne\nf\ne\nd\n \nf\no\n \ns\ne\nn\n\ni\nl\n \n\ne\ne\nr\nh\nT\n\ni\n\ns\nd\nr\na\nd\nn\na\nt\ns\n \ns\nc\nh\nt\ne\nd\nn\na\n \nt\nc\nu\nd\nn\no\nC\n\n \n\nERCF governance and policies\n\nERCF risk appetite\n\nERCF risk taxonomy\n\nERCF key controls\n\nERCF metrics\n\nIncidents\n\nEnterprise risk and control assessment\n\nRisk and control self-assessments\n\nCompliance risk assessment\n\nLegal risk assessment\n\nTop ERCF risks\n\nIssues and action management\n\nERCF change assessments\n\nERCF scenario analysis, stress \ntesting, capital modelling and \n\nreverse stress testing\n\nRisk management\n\n163\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nERCF key controls are documented and assessed under a com-\nmon controls assessment framework, ensuring that key controls \nare identified, documented, executed and assessed consistently \nand comprehensively, with a focus on the Group\xe2\x80\x99s most significant \nrisks and associated key controls. We utilize a comprehensive set \nof internal controls that are designed to ensure that our activities \nfollow agreed policies and that processes operate as intended. \nKey controls are subject to independent testing to evaluate their \neffectiveness. The results of these tests are considered by other \nERCF components, such as in the RCSA process.\n\nERCF metrics are risk and control indicators that are used to \nmonitor identified operational risks, compliance risks and con-\ntrols over time. A key risk indicator is defined as a metric used \nto provide early warning of increasing risk exposure and can be \nbackward and forward looking in nature. A key control indicator \nis defined as a metric that assesses and monitors the effective-\nness of one or several controls. Minimum standards apply to the \nidentification, selection, risk mapping approval, monitoring and \nescalation of metrics that are linked to ERCF risk appetite and top \nERCF risks which are reported to the CARMC internal controls \nsystem cycle and divisional, functional or legal entity risk manage-\nment committees. Key risk and control indicators may also be \nused as inputs into scenario analysis and capital allocation.\n\nIncidents describes the process in which we systematically col-\nlect, analyze and report data on operational and compliance risk \nincidents to ensure that we understand the reasons why they \noccurred and how controls can be improved to reduce the risk of \nfuture incidents. We focus both on incidents that result in eco-\nnomic losses and on events that provide information on potential \ncontrol gaps, even if no losses occurred. We also collect and \nutilize available data on incidents at relevant peer firms to identify \npotential risks that may be relevant in the future, even if they have \nnot impacted the Group. Incident data is also a key input for our \noperational risk capital models and other analytics.\n\nEnterprise risk and control assessment consolidates the \nassessment, review and challenge activities for operational, com-\npliance and legal risks across all divisions and functions into a sin-\ngle framework and consists of the elements RCSA, compliance \nrisk assessment and any associated legal risk assessment:\np  Risk and control self-assessments are comprehensive, \n\nbottom-up assessments of the key operational and compliance \nrisks in each business and control function. The process of \npreparing RCSAs comprises a self-assessment of the relevant \nbusiness line or functional risk profile based on the Group-\nwide ERCF risk taxonomy classifying risks under a standard-\nized approach. It covers an assessment of the inherent risks \nof each business and control function, provides an evalua-\ntion of the effectiveness of the controls in place to mitigate \nthese risks, determines the residual risk ratings and requires \na decision to either accept or remediate any residual risks. In \nthe case of remediation, mitigating actions are defined and \napproved by management. While these are self-assessments, \nthey are subject to independent review and challenge by rele-\nvant risk management functions to ensure that they have been \n\n164\n\nRisk management\n\nconducted appropriately. RCSAs utilize other components of \nthe ERCF, such as ERCF metrics and incidents, and they gen-\nerate outputs that are used to manage and monitor risks.\n\np  Compliance risk assessment is the Group\xe2\x80\x99s formal, pro-\nactive dynamic process which provides the framework for \nthe independent second line compliance function to formally \nassess the overall compliance and regulatory risks associated \nwith a particular business unit or business activity. The results \nare used to identify potential or actual areas of risk in the busi-\nness which also assists compliance management in planning \nthe compliance objectives to mitigate risks identified. This risk \nassessment consists of an analysis of the inherent risk and \ncontrol effectiveness aligned to the compliance risk categories \nand is performed at the level of a risk unit. Quantitative metrics \nare leveraged wherever possible, supplementing the qualita-\ntive assessments. Upon completion of the assessment, overall \nrisk unit ratings are established through a compliance divisional \nand Group-wide review and mitigating actions are identified as \nappropriate. The results of the compliance risk assessment are \npresented to the Board and the Group\xe2\x80\x99s Audit Committee.\n\np  Legal risk assessment is a sub-assessment of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s \nRCSA with the objective to conduct an enhanced assessment \nof legal risks across the Group. The legal risk assessment is \nbased on the principles defined for the RCSA program. The \nGeneral Counsel function reviews the results of the legal risk \nassessments performed by business units across the Group. \nThe legal risk assessment complements the RCSA process in \nproviding an independent review and challenge process by the \nsecond line of defense.\n\nTop ERCF risks are identified at the Group, divisional and corpo-\nrate function levels and represent the most significant risks requir-\ning senior management attention. They are generated through a \ncombination of top-down assessment by senior management and \na bottom-up process collating the main themes arising from the \nRCSA and compliance risk assessment processes. Where appro-\npriate, remediation plans are put in place with ownership by senior \nmanagement.\n\nIssues and action management encompasses a structured \napproach to responding to operational and compliance risk inci-\ndents and breaches of ERCF quantitative and qualitative risk \nappetite or metrics, as well as continuous monitoring of remedia-\ntion actions against identified control issues. It is applicable to \nbusiness divisions and corporate functions globally. Further, the \ncompliance and regulatory responses function consolidates and \nmonitors Group-wide issues and actions including audit, regula-\ntory, self-identified and second line identified issues and actions. \nThe operational risk incident management component includes a \ndefined process for identifying, categorizing, investigating, esca-\nlating and remediating incidents. These reviews seek to assess \nthe causes of control weaknesses, establish appropriate remedia-\ntion actions and ascertain whether events have implications for \nother businesses or could have a potential impact in the future. \nThey can result in recommendations to impose restrictions on \nbusinesses while operational risk management processes and \n\n\x0c \n\n \n\ncontrols are improved. The breach component provides a method-\nology for evaluating breaches of quantitative and qualitative ERCF \nrisk appetite statements. Its goal is to provide senior management \nwith the information needed to make decisions on how to best \nremediate issues that fall outside agreed risk appetite levels.\n\nWhere appropriate, major strategic change programs may also \nundergo independent ERCF change assessments by the oper-\national risk function, leveraging the ERCF assessment framework \nto determine the potential impact of the change activity on the \noverall operational risk profile of the impacted area both during \nand after implementation.\n\nERCF scenario analysis is focused on operational and compli-\nance risks and is used to identify and measure exposure to a \nrange of adverse events, such as unauthorized trading, transac-\ntion processing errors and compliance issues. These scenar-\nios help businesses assess the suitability of controls in light of \npotential losses, and they are also an input to the internal models \nused by the Group to calculate stressed loss projections as well \nas economic and regulatory capital. More specifically, the ERCF \nstress testing is a sub-component of the Group-wide stress \ntesting framework and it focuses on the evaluation of potential \noperational risk impacts of macro-economic scenarios on net \nincome and regulatory capital across a number of operational \nrisk categories. The macro-economic scenarios are provided as \npart of regulatory processes, such as CCAR and loss potential \nanalysis, or internal processes, such as financial planning and risk \nappetite setting. Capital modelling is based on an advanced \nmeasurement approach (AMA) and utilizes both historical data \nas well as scenario analysis to estimate capital requirements for \nthe Group, as further described below. Finally, ERCF reverse \nstress testing is an additional complementary tool that intro-\nduces a more forward-looking element into the RCSA process. It \nassumes that a business has suffered an adverse outcome, such \nas a large operational risk loss, and requires consideration of the \nevents that could have led to the result. As such, it allows for the \nconsideration of risks beyond normal business expectations and it \nchallenges common assumptions about the risk profile, the emer-\ngence of new risks or interactions between existing risks, as well \nas the performance of expected control and mitigation strategies.\n\nOperational risk regulatory capital measurement\nWe have used an internal model to calculate the regulatory capital \nrequirement for operational risk under the AMA approach since \n2008. This model was replaced with an enhanced AMA internal \nmodel in 2014, which has been approved by FINMA. \n\nassessment of each scenario. Insurance mitigation is included \nin the regulatory capital requirement for operational risk where \nappropriate, by considering the level of insurance coverage for \neach scenario and incorporating haircuts as appropriate. The \ninternal model then uses the adjusted parameters to generate \nan overall loss distribution for the Group over a one-year time \nhorizon. The AMA capital requirement represents the 99.9th \npercentile of this overall loss distribution. We use a risk-sensitive \napproach to allocating the AMA capital requirement to businesses \nthat is designed to be forward-looking and incentivize appropriate \nrisk management behaviors.\n\nIn 2018, we updated the treatment of historic losses relating to \ndivested businesses in the model, particularly those relating to the \nprivate banking business in the US that we exited. In addition, we \nincreased the coverage provided by our operational risk insurance \npolicy. These changes resulted in a decrease of our operational \nrisk capital requirements.\n\nConduct risk\n\nThe Group considers conduct risk to be the risk that improper \nbehavior or judgment by our employees may result in a nega-\ntive financial, non-financial or reputational impact to our clients, \nemployees or the Group, or negatively impact the integrity of \nthe financial markets. Conduct risk may arise from a wide vari-\nety of activities and types of behaviors. A Group-wide definition \nof conduct risk supports the efforts of our employees to have a \ncommon understanding of and consistently manage, minimize \nand mitigate our conduct risk. Further, it promotes standards of \nresponsible conduct and ethics in our employees. Managing con-\nduct risk includes consideration of the risks generated by each \nbusiness and the strength of the associated mitigating controls. \nConduct risk is also assessed by reviewing and learning from past \nincidents within the Group and at other firms in the financial ser-\nvices sector. Compliance oversees conduct risk for the Group.\n\nThe ongoing focus and investment in a strong risk culture is fun-\ndamental to the management of conduct risk. The Group\xe2\x80\x99s Code \nof Conduct provides a clear statement on our conduct expecta-\ntions and ethical values, supported by our conduct and ethics \nstandards.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cRisk culture\xe2\x80\x9d in Risk management oversight and to \xe2\x80\x9cCorporate gover-\nnance framework\xe2\x80\x9d in IV \xe2\x80\x93 Corporate Governance \xe2\x80\x93 Overview for further infor-\nmation on our Code of Conduct.\n\nTechnology risk\n\nThe model is based on a loss distribution approach that uses \nhistorical data on internal and relevant external losses of peers \nto generate frequency and severity distributions for a range of \npotential operational risk loss scenarios, such as an unauthor-\nized trading incident or a material business disruption. Busi-\nness experts and senior management review, and may adjust, \nthe parameters of these scenarios to take account of business \nenvironment and internal control factors, such as RCSA results \nand risk and control indicators, to provide a forward-looking \n\nTechnology risk deserves particular attention given the complex \ntechnological landscape that covers our business model. Ensuring \nthat confidentiality, integrity and availability of information assets \nare protected is critical to our operations.\n\nTechnology risk is the risk that technology-related failures, such \nas service outages or information security incidents, may disrupt \nbusiness. Technology risk is inherent not only in our IT assets, but \nalso in the people and processes that interact with them including \n\nRisk management\n\n165\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nthrough dependency on third-party suppliers and the worldwide \ntelecommunications infrastructure. We seek to ensure that the \ndata used to support key business processes and reporting is \nsecure, complete, accurate, available, timely and meets appropri-\nate quality and integrity standards. We require our critical IT sys-\ntems to be identified, secure, resilient and available and support \nour ongoing operations, decision-making, communications and \nreporting. Our systems must also have the capability, capacity, \nscalability and adaptability to meet current and future business \nobjectives, the needs of our customers and regulatory and legal \nexpectations. Failure to meet these standards and requirements \nmay result in adverse events that could subject us to reputational \ndamage, fines, litigation, regulatory sanctions, financial losses or \nloss of market share.\n\nTechnology risks are managed through our technology risk man-\nagement program, business continuity management plan and \nbusiness contingency and resiliency plans. Technology risks are \nincluded as part of our overall enterprise risk and control assess-\nment based upon a forward-looking approach focusing on the \nmost significant risks in terms of potential impact and likelihood.\n\nCyber risk\nCyber risk, which is part of technology risk, is the risk that we will \nbe compromised as a result of cyber attacks, security breaches, \nunauthorized access, loss or destruction of data, unavailabil-\nity of service, computer viruses or other events that could have \nan adverse security impact. Any such event could subject us to \nlitigation or cause us to suffer a financial loss, a disruption of our \nbusinesses, liability to our clients, regulatory intervention or repu-\ntational damage. We could also be required to expend signifi-\ncant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to \ninvestigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures.\n\nWe recognize that cyber risk represents a rapidly evolving exter-\nnal risk landscape. The financial industry continues to face cyber \nthreats from a variety of actors who are driven by monetary, politi-\ncal and other motivations. We actively monitor external incidents \nand threats and assess and respond accordingly to any potential \nvulnerabilities that this may reveal. We are also an active partici-\npant in industry forums and information exchange initiatives and \nengage in regulatory consultation on this subject.\n\nWe have an enterprise-wide cybersecurity strategy to provide \nstrategic guidance as part of our efforts to achieve an optimized \nend-to-end security and risk competence that enables a secure \nand innovative business environment, aligned with the Group\xe2\x80\x99s \nrisk appetite. Our technology security team leverages a wide \narray of leading technology solutions and industry best practices \nto support our ability to maintain a secure perimeter and detect \nand respond to threats in real time.\n\nWe regularly assess the effectiveness of our key controls and \nwe conduct ongoing employee training and awareness activi-\nties, including for key management personnel, in order to embed \na strong cyber risk culture. As part of the ERCF, the Execu-\ntive Board as well as divisional and legal entity risk management \n\n166\n\nRisk management\n\ncommittees are given updates on the broader technology risk \nexposure.\n\nSenior management, including the Board and its Risk Commit-\ntee, are actively engaged and regularly informed on the extent of \nthe threats and mitigations in place to manage cyber incidents. \nRelated business continuity and response plans are rehearsed \nregularly at all levels, up to and including the Executive Board. \nNotable incidents are escalated to the Risk Committee together \nwith lessons learned and mitigation plans.\n\nLegal risk\n\nLegal risk is the risk of loss or imposition of damages, fines, pen-\nalties or other liability or any other material adverse impact aris-\ning from circumstances including the failure to comply with legal \nobligations, whether contractual, statutory or otherwise, changes \nin enforcement practices, the making of a legal challenge or claim \nagainst us, our inability to enforce legal rights or the failure to take \nmeasures to protect our rights.\n\nReputational risk\n\nReputational risk is the risk that negative perception by our stake-\nholders, including clients, counterparties, employees, sharehold-\ners, regulators and the general public, may adversely impact client \nacquisition and damage our business relationships with clients \nand counterparties, affecting staff morale and reducing access to \nfunding sources.\n\nReputational risk may arise from a variety of sources, including, \nbut not limited to, the nature or purpose of a proposed transaction \nor service, the identity or activity of a potential client, the regula-\ntory or political climate in which the business will be transacted, \nand the potentially controversial environmental or social impacts of \na transaction or significant public attention surrounding the trans-\naction itself. The risk may also arise from reputational damage in \nthe aftermath of an operational risk incident, such as cyber crime \nor the failure by employees to meet expected conduct and ethical \nstandards.\n\nReputational risk is included in the Group\xe2\x80\x99s risk appetite frame-\nwork to ensure that risk-taking is aligned with the approved risk \nappetite. We highly value our reputation and are fully commit-\nted to protecting it through a prudent approach to risk-taking and \na responsible approach to business. This is achieved through \nthe use of dedicated processes, resources and policies focused \non identifying, evaluating, managing and reporting potential \nreputational risks. This is also achieved by applying the highest \nstandards of personal accountability and ethical conduct as set \nout in the Group\xe2\x80\x99s Code of Conduct and the Group\xe2\x80\x99s approach \nto conduct and ethics. Reputational risk potentially arising from \nproposed business transactions and client activity is assessed in \nthe reputational risk review process. The Group\xe2\x80\x99s global policy \non reputational risk requires employees to be conservative when \nassessing potential reputational impact and, where certain indica-\ntors give rise to potential reputational risk, the relevant business \n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nproposal or service must be submitted through the reputational \nrisk review process. This involves a submission by an originator \n(any employee), approval by a business area head or designee, \nand its subsequent referral to one of the assigned reputational \nrisk approvers, each of whom is an experienced and high-ranking \nsenior manager, independent of the business divisions, who has \nauthority to approve, reject or impose conditions on our participa-\ntion in the transaction or service. \n\nThe RRSC, on a global level, and the reputational risk commit-\ntees, on a divisional or legal entity level, are the governing bodies \nresponsible for the oversight and active discussion of reputational \nrisk and sustainability issues. At the Board level, the Risk Com-\nmittee and Audit Committee jointly assist the Board in fulfilling \nits reputational risk oversight responsibilities by reviewing and \napproving the Group\xe2\x80\x99s risk appetite framework as well as assess-\ning the adequacy of the management of reputational risks. \n\nIn order to inform our stakeholders about how we manage some \nof the environmental and social risks inherent to the banking busi-\nness, we publish our Corporate Responsibility Report, in which we \nalso describe our efforts to conduct our operations in a manner \nthat is environmentally and socially responsible and broadly con-\ntributes to society. \n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9ccredit-suisse.com/responsibility\xe2\x80\x9d for our Corporate Responsibility \n\nReport.\n\nFiduciary risk\n\nFiduciary risk is the risk of financial loss arising when the Group \nor its employees, acting in a fiduciary capacity as trustee, invest-\nment manager or as mandated by law, do not act in the best \ninterest of the client in connection with the advice and manage-\nment of our client\xe2\x80\x99s assets including from a product-related mar-\nket, credit, liquidity, counterparty and operational risk perspective.\n\nAssessing investment performance and reviewing forward-looking \ninvestment risks in our discretionary client portfolios and invest-\nment funds is central to our oversight program. Areas of focus \ninclude:\np  Measuring investment performance of discretionary client port-\nfolios and investment funds and comparing the returns against \nbenchmarks to understand sources and drivers of the returns.\n\np  Assessing risk measures such as exposure, sensitivities, \n\nstress scenarios, expected volatility and liquidity across our \nportfolios to ensure that we are managing the assets in line \nwith the clients\xe2\x80\x99 expectations and risk tolerance.\n\np  Treating clients with a prudent standard of care, which \n\nincludes information disclosure, subscriptions and redemptions \nprocesses, trade execution and requiring the highest ethical \nconduct.\n\np  Ensuring discretionary portfolio managers\xe2\x80\x99 investment \n\napproach is in line with client expectations and in accordance \nwith prospectus and guidelines.\n\np  Monitoring client investment guidelines or investment fund lim-\nits. In certain cases, internal limits or guidelines are also estab-\nlished and monitored.\n\nSound governance is essential for all discretionary management \nactivities including trade execution and the investment process. \nOur program targets daily, monthly or quarterly monitoring of all \nportfolio management activities with independent analysis pro-\nvided to senior management. Formal review meetings are in place \nto ensure that investment performance and risks are in line with \nexpectations and adequately supervised.\n\nStrategic risk\n\nStrategic risk is the risk of financial loss or reputational damage \narising from inappropriate strategic decisions, ineffective imple-\nmentation of business strategies or an inability to adapt business \nstrategies in response to changes in the business environment. \nStrategic risk may arise from a variety of sources, including: \np  an inadequate or inaccurate understanding of our existing \n\ncapabilities and competitive positioning;\n\np  an inadequate or inaccurate analysis of current and prospec-\ntive operating conditions in our markets, including the macro-\neconomic environment, client and competitor behaviors and \nactions, regulatory developments and technological impacts;\n\np  inappropriate strategic decisions, such as those pertaining \nto which activities we will undertake, which markets and cli-\nent segments we will serve, which organizational structure \nwe will adopt and how we will position ourselves relative to \ncompetitors;\n\np  ineffective implementation and execution of chosen business \n\nstrategies and related organizational changes;\n\np  the inability to properly identify and analyze key changes in our \n\noperating environment, and to adapt strategies accordingly; \nand\n\np  the inability to properly monitor progress against strategic \n\nobjectives.\n\nA wide variety of financial, risk, client and market analyses are \nused to monitor the effectiveness of our strategies and the per-\nformance of our businesses against their strategic objectives. \nThese include an analysis of current and expected operating con-\nditions, an analysis of current and target market positioning, and \ndetailed scenario planning.\n\nStrategic plans are developed by each division annually and \naggregated into a Group plan, which is reviewed by the Group \nCRO, CFO and CEO before presentation to the full Executive \nBoard. Following approval by the Executive Board, the Group plan \nis submitted for review and approval to the Board. In addition, \nthere is an annual strategic review at which the Board evaluates \nthe Group\xe2\x80\x99s performance against strategic objectives and sets the \noverall strategic direction for the Group. From time to time, the \nBoard and the Executive Board conduct more fundamental in-\ndepth reviews of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s strategy.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cStrategy\xe2\x80\x9d in I \xe2\x80\x93 Information on the company for further information.\n\nTo complement the annual cycle, each division presents a more \ndetailed individual analysis to review key dimensions of its strat-\negy at various points during the year. Additionally, the CEO, the \nExecutive Board and individual business heads regularly assess \n\nRisk management\n\n167\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nthe performance of each business against strategic objec-\ntives through a series of strategic business reviews conducted \nthroughout the year. The reviews include assessments of busi-\nness strategy, overall operating environment, including our com-\npetitive position, financial performance and key business risks.\n\nClimate-related risks\nFollowing the publication of recommendations from the FSB\xe2\x80\x99s \nTask Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) in \nJune 2017, climate risk is emerging as an important area of focus \nfor the economy. The final TCFD report establishes a high-level \nframework for considering climate-related risks and opportunities \nin a firm\xe2\x80\x99s strategy and is applicable to listed corporations across \nall sectors globally.\n\nIn response to the TCFD recommendations, we have established \na climate change program with the overall goal of addressing rec-\nommendations related to external disclosures of climate-linked \nrisks and opportunities. The program team has worked to formal-\nize climate-related governance and definitions in our key policies \nand to define the principles for climate risk strategy and man-\nagement. The TCFD presented its recommendations in the four \ncategories of governance, strategy, risk management and metrics \nand targets. We are in the process of assessing and implement-\ning certain measures to address these recommendations, as \nsummarized below.\n\nGovernance\nWe have updated the Risk Committee charter to include specific \nresponsibility for climate risk management. The market & credit \nrisk cycle of CARMC is now mandated to ensure that the capabili-\nties for the management of relevant long-term risk trends, includ-\ning climate change, are put in place. The RRSC has assumed \nresponsibility for overall climate change strategy and policy. We \nhave also updated key policies, including the reputational risk \npolicy and the sustainability management policy, to incorporate \nimportant elements of climate risk management.\n\nStrategy\nWe have identified several key risks and opportunities, originat-\ning from either the physical or the transition effects of climate \nchange. Physical risks can arise from climate and weather-related \nevents (e.g., heatwaves, droughts, floods, storms and sea-level \nrise) and can potentially result in material financial losses, impair-\ning asset values and the creditworthiness of borrowers. Transition \nrisks can arise from the process of adjustment towards a low-\ncarbon economy through changes in climate policy, technologi-\ncal developments and disruptive business models, and shifting \ninvestor and consumer sentiment. Physical and transition climate \nrisks can affect us as an organization either directly, through our \nphysical assets, costs and operations, or indirectly, through our \nfinancial relationships with our clients. We ultimately aim to lever-\nage existing risk management processes and capabilities for \nthe management of climate risk exposures, potentially including \n\nfinancial planning and strategy setting, by mapping the underlying \nclimate risks to our existing risk types.\n\nIn line with the TCFD recommendations, we have developed a \n2\xc2\xb0C and a 4\xc2\xb0C scenario as part of our plan to assess the resil-\nience of our strategy towards climate change. We are pursuing a \nrange of pilot studies to investigate the impact of these scenarios \non our business.\n\nWe are engaged in a range of activities which may support the \ntransition to a lower carbon and more climate-resilient economy. \nOur green finance solutions are designed to achieve a positive \nimpact on the environment while also creating financial value \nfor our clients, drawing upon the expertise of various specialist \ndepartments across our divisions.\n\nIn 2018, Credit Suisse supported clients in raising over USD\xc2\xa06 \nbillion of green bonds globally. Since 2013 we have supported \nthe issuance of USD\xc2\xa015 billion of green bonds for our clients. \nWe are also active in the sustainability lending market and during \n2018 we participated in a total of over USD\xc2\xa014 billion worth of \nsustainability-linked loans from a range of European borrowers. \nCredit Suisse actively supports clean and renewable energy busi-\nnesses and, until the end of 2018, had been involved in over 110 \ntransactions in this field with a value of more than USD\xc2\xa094 billion \nsince 2010. We offer a number of funds focused on sustainabil-\nity, green bond investments and sustainable real estate as well \nas products and services in conservation finance, for example our \nCS Real Estate Green Property Fund and CS Green Bond Fund. \nWe also participate in sustainable finance through our Impact \nAdvisory and Finance department.\n\nRisk management\nHistorically we have considered climate change-related impacts \nmainly in connection with our management of reputational and \noperational risks. Risk management of climate change expo-\nsure from our financial relationships presents a challenge owing \nto the long-term nature of the climate impacts versus the rela-\ntively shorter-term nature of banking portfolios. The climate risk \nidentification process relies on our existing risk identification and \nassessment process, but also leverages a newly established cli-\nmate risk and opportunities inventory. Climate risk is now embed-\nded in our firm-wide risk taxonomy, and we expect to continue to \ndevelop the climate inventory as industry best practice and con-\nsensus on climate risks and opportunities evolve.\n\nMetrics and targets\nWe measure our balance sheet assets and credit risk-weighted \nassets across the following fossil fuel industry sectors: oil and \ngas, power generation and coal mining. In addition, we are devel-\noping a set of internal metrics to assess our climate risk-related \nfinancial exposures, and we are managing and disclosing green-\nhouse gas emissions from our own operations on the basis of an \nISO 14001-certified environmental management system.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9ccredit-suisse.com/responsibility\xe2\x80\x9d for our Corporate Responsibility \n\nReport.\n\n168\n\nRisk management\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nRisk review and results\nEconomic risk capital review\n\nMethodology and model developments\nWe regularly review and update our economic risk capital meth-\nodology in order to ensure that the model remains relevant as \nmarkets and business strategies evolve. In the event of material \nmethodology changes and dataset and model parameter updates, \nprior-period balances are restated in order to show meaningful \ntrends.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cEconomic risk capital\xe2\x80\x9d in Risk coverage and management for further \n\ninformation on the 2018 economic risk capital methodology changes.\n\nThe net impact of the methodology changes and updates imple-\nmented in the first quarter of 2018, including the revised eco-\nnomic risk capital methodology implemented with effect from \nJanuary\xc2\xa01, 2018, on economic risk capital for the Group as of \nDecember\xc2\xa031, 2017 was a decrease of CHF\xc2\xa01.5 billion, or 4.4%.\n\nThe net impact of the methodology changes and updates imple-\nmented in the fourth quarter of 2018 on economic risk capital for \nthe Group as of December\xc2\xa031, 2017 was a decrease of CHF\xc2\xa02.5 \nbillion, or 7.6%. \n\nThe combined net impact of all methodology changes and \nupdates implemented in the first and fourth quarter of 2018 on \neconomic risk capital for the Group as of the end of Decem-\nber\xc2\xa031, 2017 was a decrease of CHF\xc2\xa04.0 billion, or 12.0%, to \nCHF\xc2\xa029.1 billion.

BIS look-through CET1 capital increased \nCHF\xc2\xa01.0 billion, mainly reflecting net income attributable to \nshareholders, partially offset by the cash component of a divi-\ndend accrual and a negative foreign exchange impact. Economic \nadjustments decreased CHF\xc2\xa02.1 billion, mainly driven by the \nredemption of CHF\xc2\xa05.9 billion of high-trigger tier\xc2\xa01 capital instru-\nments, partially offset by new issuances.\n\nEconomic risk capital and coverage ratio\nend of\xc2\xa0 \n\nAvailable economic capital (CHF million, except where indicated)\xc2\xa0 \n \n \nBIS look-through CET1 capital (Basel III)\xc2\xa0 \nEconomic adjustments\xc2\xa01 \nAvailable economic capital\xc2\xa0 \n\nPosition risk\xc2\xa0 \n \n \nCredit risk\xc2\xa0 \nNon-traded credit spread risk\xc2\xa0 \nSecuritized products\xc2\xa0 \nTraded risk\xc2\xa0 \nEmerging markets country event risk\xc2\xa0 \nEquity investments\xc2\xa0 \nDiversification benefit\xc2\xa02 \nPosition risk (99% confidence level for risk management purposes)\xc2\xa0 \n\nEconomic risk capital\xc2\xa0 \n \n \nPosition risk (99.97% confidence level for capital management purposes)\xc2\xa0 \nOperational risk\xc2\xa0 \nOther risks\xc2\xa03 \nEconomic risk capital\xc2\xa0 \nEconomic risk capital coverage ratio (%)\xc2\xa04 \n\n2018   \n\n2017    % change \n\n35,824   \n13,355   \n49,179   \n\n34,824   \n15,460   \n50,284   \n\n2,155   \n3,463   \n1,706   \n1,574   \n697   \n417   \n(1,195)   \n8,817   \n\n19,471   \n6,702   \n3,248   \n29,421   \n167   \n\n2,735   \n2,631   \n945   \n1,121   \n450   \n358   \n(897)   \n7,343   \n\n18,481   \n6,936   \n3,692   \n29,109   \n173   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n3 \n(14) \n(2) \n\n \n \n(21) \n32 \n81 \n40 \n55 \n16 \n33 \n20 \n\n \n \n5 \n(3) \n(12) \n1 \n\xe2\x80\x93 \n\n1 Includes primarily high- and low-trigger capital instruments, adjustments to unrealized gains on owned real estate, reduced recognition of deferred tax assets and adjustments to treat-\n\nment of pension assets and obligations.

The increase in position risk was primarily driven by \nhigher non-traded credit spread risk due to a reduced benefit \nfrom hedges in Investment Banking & Capital Markets and new \nloan commitments in the US in Global Markets, higher securitized \nproducts risk, primarily reflecting a reduced benefit from hedges \nin Global Markets, and higher traded risk, primarily reflecting \nincreased higher order risks in equity derivatives in the US in \nGlobal Markets. These increases were partially offset by lower \ncredit risk, mainly due to decreased trading book exposures in the \nUS in Global Markets, reduced counterparty exposures in Europe \nin the Strategic Resolution Unit and a LGD parameter update, \nwhich primarily impacted Global Markets, Investment Banking & \nCapital Markets and the Strategic Resolution Unit. The decrease \nin other risks was mainly due to lower pension risk related to the \nSwiss pension plan in International Wealth Management and \nSwiss Universal Bank, driven by a reduction in equity investments \nas part of portfolio rebalancing as well as a recalibration of real \nestate parameters. The decrease in operational risk was mainly \ndue to increased coverage provided by our operational risk insur-\nance policy.\n\n       \n\n2018   \n\n5,562   \n3,128   \n4,499   \n7,819   \n3,815   \n3,006   \n1,592   \n29,421   \n\nEnd of period   \n2017    % change   \n\n       \n\n2018   \n\nAverage \n2017    % change \n\n5,694   \n3,288   \n3,820   \n6,764   \n3,148   \n4,669   \n1,726   \n29,109   \n\n(2)   \n(5)   \n18   \n16   \n21   \n(36)   \n(8)   \n1   \n\n5,634   \n3,206   \n3,965   \n7,491   \n3,384   \n3,837   \n1,718   \n29,235   \n\n5,603   \n3,084   \n3,836   \n6,729   \n2,790   \n6,053   \n1,655   \n29,750   \n\n \n \n \n \n \n1 \n4 \n3 \n11 \n21 \n(37) \n4 \n(2) \n\nMarket risk review\n\nTrading book\nDevelopment of trading book risks\nThe tables entitled \xe2\x80\x9cOne-day, 98% risk management VaR\xe2\x80\x9d and \n\xe2\x80\x9cAverage one-day, 98% risk management VaR by division\xe2\x80\x9d show \nour trading-related market risk exposure, as measured by one-\nday, 98% risk management VaR in Swiss francs and US dol-\nlars.

In the course of 2018, we \nupdated our internal methodology for measuring interest rate risk \non banking book positions in anticipation of new FINMA rules, \nwhich became effective on January\xc2\xa01, 2019. For regulatory pur-\nposes, we now exclude from the Group\xe2\x80\x99s exposure calculation \nnon-interest-bearing assets and liabilities comprising the sum \nof shareholders\xe2\x80\x99 equity less deferred tax assets, goodwill and \npremises and equipment. We have also updated the client mar-\ngin measurement on our Swiss private banking lending portfolio. \nThe Group\xe2\x80\x99s strategy for managing interest rate risk on banking \nbook positions has not been affected. The prior-period balance \nhas been restated to reflect these methodology updates. As of \nDecember\xc2\xa031, 2018, the interest rate sensitivity of a one basis \npoint parallel increase in yield curves was negative CHF\xc2\xa01.5 mil-\nlion, compared to positive CHF\xc2\xa00.2 million as of December\xc2\xa031, \n2017.

Equity risk on banking book positions is \nmeasured using sensitivity analysis that estimates the poten-\ntial change in value resulting from a 10% decline in the equity \nmarkets of developed nations and a 20% decline in the equity \nmarkets of emerging market nations. The estimated impact of this \nscenario would have been a decrease of CHF\xc2\xa0312 million in the \nvalue of the banking book portfolio as of December\xc2\xa031, 2018, \ncompared to a decrease of CHF\xc2\xa0391 million as of December\xc2\xa031, \n2017.\n\nDevelopment of banking book commodity risks\nOur commodity portfolios of the banking book include mainly pre-\ncious metals, primarily gold. Commodity risk on banking book \n\npositions is measured using sensitivity analysis that estimates \nthe potential change in value resulting from a 20% weakening in \ncommodity prices. The estimated impact of this scenario on the \nvalue of the banking book portfolio would have been a decrease \nof CHF\xc2\xa00.1 million as of December\xc2\xa031, 2018 and 2017.\n\nCredit and debit valuation adjustments\nVaR excludes the impact of changes in both counterparty and our \nown credit spreads on derivative products.

the divisions disclosed.\n\nDerivative instruments\nWe enter into derivative contracts in the normal course of busi-\nness for market making, positioning and arbitrage purposes, as \nwell as for our own risk management needs, including mitigation \nof interest rate, foreign exchange and credit risk.\n\nDerivatives are either privately negotiated OTC contracts or stan-\ndard contracts transacted through regulated exchanges. The \nmost frequently used derivative products include interest rate \nswaps, cross-currency swaps and credit default swaps (CDS), \ninterest rate and foreign exchange options, foreign exchange for-\nward contracts, and foreign exchange and interest rate futures.\n\nThe replacement values of derivative instruments correspond to \ntheir fair values at the dates of the consolidated balance sheets and \narise from transactions for the account of individual customers and \nfor our own account. Positive replacement values (PRV) constitute \nan asset, while negative replacement values (NRV) constitute a \nliability. Fair value does not indicate future gains or losses, but rather \npremiums paid or received for a derivative instrument at inception, if \napplicable, and unrealized gains and losses from marking to market \n\nall derivatives at a particular point in time. The fair values of deriva-\ntives are determined using various methodologies, primarily observ-\nable market prices where available and, in their absence, observ-\nable market parameters for instruments with similar characteristics \nand maturities, net present value analysis or other pricing models as \nappropriate.\n\nThe following table illustrates how credit risk on derivatives receiv-\nables is reduced by the use of legally enforceable netting agree-\nments and collateral agreements. Netting agreements allow us to \nnet balances from derivative assets and liabilities transacted with \nthe same counterparty when the netting agreements are legally \nenforceable. Replacement values are disclosed net of such agree-\nments in the consolidated balance sheets. Collateral agreements \nare entered into with certain counterparties based upon the nature \nof the counterparty and/or the transaction and require the place-\nment of cash or securities with us as collateral for the underlying \ntransaction. The carrying values of derivatives are presented in \naccordance with generally accepted accounting standards in the \nUS and are not comparable with the derivatives metrics presented \nin our disclosures required under Pillar\xc2\xa03 of the Basel framework.\n\n178\n\nRisk management\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nDerivative instruments by maturity\n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \nend of / due within\xc2\xa0 \n\nCHF billion\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInterest rate products\xc2\xa0 \nForeign exchange products\xc2\xa0 \nEquity/index-related products\xc2\xa0 \nCredit derivatives\xc2\xa0 \nOther products\xc2\xa01 \nOTC derivative instruments\xc2\xa0 \nExchange-traded derivative instruments\xc2\xa0 \nNetting agreements\xc2\xa02 \nTotal derivative instruments\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which recorded in trading assets\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which recorded in other assets\xc2\xa0 \n\n1 Primarily precious metals, commodity and energy products.\n2 Taking into account legally enforceable netting agreements.\n\n           \n   \nLess   \nthan   \n1 year   \n\n8.0   \n14.8   \n5.5   \n0.6   \n0.7   \n29.6   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n\n   \n   \n1 to 5   \nyears   \n\n   \nMore   \nthan   \n5 years   \n\n19.1   \n7.5   \n5.8   \n2.9   \n0.0   \n35.3   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n\n42.6   \n5.6   \n0.2   \n1.9   \n1.0   \n51.3   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n\n2018   \nPositive   \nreplace-   \nment   \nvalue   \n\n69.7   \n27.9   \n11.5   \n5.4   \n1.7   \n116.2   \n12.2   \n(110.1)   \n18.3   \n18.3   \n0.0   \n\n           \n   \nLess   \nthan   \n1 year   \n\n9.6   \n16.3   \n5.4   \n0.6   \n0.4   \n32.3   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n\n   \n   \n1 to 5   \nyears   \n\n   \nMore   \nthan   \n5 years   \n\n26.5   \n8.0   \n6.6   \n5.3   \n0.2   \n46.6   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n\n50.9   \n6.2   \n0.1   \n1.8   \n1.0   \n60.0   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \n\n \n\n2017 \nPositive \nreplace- \nment \nvalue \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n87.0 \n30.5 \n12.1 \n7.7 \n1.6 \n138.9 \n9.5 \n(128.8) \n19.6 \n19.6 \n0.0 \n\nDerivative transactions exposed to credit risk are subject to a \ncredit request and approval process, ongoing credit and counter-\nparty monitoring and a credit quality review process.

In addition, we enter \ninto futures contracts on equity-based indices and other financial \ninstruments, as well as options on futures contracts. These con-\ntracts are typically entered into to meet the needs of customers, \nfor trading and for hedging purposes.\n\nOn forward contracts, we are exposed to counterparty credit risk. \nTo mitigate this credit risk, we limit transactions by counterparty, \nregularly review credit limits and adhere to internally established \ncredit extension policies.\n\nFor futures contracts and options on futures contracts, the \nchange in the market value is settled with a clearing broker in \ncash each day. As a result, our credit risk with the clearing bro-\nker is limited to the net positive change in the market value for a \nsingle day.\n\nRisk management\n\n179\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nSwaps\nOur swap agreements consist primarily of interest rate swaps, \nCDS, currency and equity swaps. We enter into swap agree-\nments for trading and risk management purposes. Interest rate \nswaps are contractual agreements to exchange interest rate pay-\nments based on agreed upon notional amounts and maturities. \nCDS are contractual agreements in which the buyer of the swap \npays a periodic fee in return for a contingent payment by the \nseller of the swap following a credit event of a reference entity. \nA credit event is commonly defined as bankruptcy, insolvency, \nreceivership, material adverse restructuring of debt, or failure to \nmeet payment obligations when due. Currency swaps are con-\ntractual agreements to exchange payments in different curren-\ncies based on agreed notional amounts and currency pairs. Equity \nswaps are contractual agreements to receive the appreciation or \ndepreciation in value based on a specific strike price on an equity \ninstrument in exchange for paying another rate, which is usually \nbased on an index or interest rate movements.\n\nOptions\nWe write options specifically designed to meet the needs of cus-\ntomers and for trading purposes. These written options do not \nexpose us to the credit risk of the customer because, if exer-\ncised, we and not our counterparty are obligated to perform. \nAt the beginning of the contract period, we receive a cash pre-\nmium. During the contract period, we bear the risk of unfavorable \nchanges in the value of the financial instruments underlying the \noptions. To manage this market risk, we purchase or sell cash or \nderivative financial instruments. Such purchases and sales may \ninclude debt and equity securities, forward and futures contracts, \nswaps and options.\n\nWe also purchase options to meet customer needs, for trading \npurposes and for hedging purposes. For purchased options, we \nobtain the right to buy or sell the underlying instrument at a fixed \nprice on or before a specified date. During the contract period, \nour risk is limited to the premium paid. The underlying instruments \nfor these options typically include fixed income and equity securi-\nties, foreign currencies and interest rate instruments or indices. \nCounterparties to these option contracts are regularly reviewed in \norder to assess creditworthiness.\n\nSelected European credit risk exposures\nThe scope of our disclosure of European credit risk exposure \nincludes all countries of the EU which are rated below AA or its \nequivalent by at least one of the three major rating agencies and \nwhere our gross exposure exceeds our quantitative threshold of \nEUR\xc2\xa00.5 billion. We believe this external rating is a useful mea-\nsure in determining the financial ability of countries to meet their \nfinancial obligations, including giving an indication of vulnerability \nto adverse business, financial and economic conditions.\n\nMonitoring of selected European credit risk exposures\nOur credit risk exposure to these European countries is man-\naged as part of our overall risk management process. The Group \nmakes use of country limits and performs scenario analyses on \na regular basis, which include analyses of our indirect sovereign \ncredit risk exposures from our exposures to selected European \nfinancial institutions. This assessment of indirect sovereign credit \nrisk exposures includes analysis of publicly available disclosures \nof counterparties\xe2\x80\x99 exposures to the European countries within the \ndefined scope of our disclosure. We monitor the concentration of \ncollateral underpinning our OTC derivative and reverse repurchase \nagreement exposures through monthly reporting. We also monitor \nthe impact of sovereign rating downgrades on collateral eligibility. \nStrict limits on sovereign collateral from G7 and non-G7 countries \nare monitored monthly. Similar disclosure is part of our regular \nrisk reporting to regulators.\n\nAs part of our global scenario framework, the counterparty credit \nrisk stress testing framework measures counterparty exposure \nunder scenarios calibrated to the 99th percentile for the worst \none month and one year moves observed in the available his-\ntory, as well as the absolutely worst weekly move observed in the \nsame dataset. The scenario results are aggregated at the coun-\nterparty level for all our counterparties, including all European \ncountries to which we have exposure. Furthermore, counterparty \ndefault scenarios are run where specific entities are set to default. \nIn one of these scenarios, a European sovereign default is inves-\ntigated. This scenario determines the maximum exposure that we \nhave to this country in the event of its default and serves to iden-\ntify those counterparties where exposure will rise substantially as \na result of the modeled country defaulting.\n\nThe scenario framework also considers a range of other severe \nscenarios, including a specific eurozone crisis scenario which \nassumes the default of selected European countries, currently \nmodeled to include Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. It is \nassumed that the sovereigns, financial institutions and corporates \nwithin these countries default, with a 100% loss of sovereign \nand financial institutions exposures and a 0% to 100% loss of \ncorporates depending on their credit ratings. As part of this sce-\nnario, we additionally assume a severe market sell-off involving an \nequity market crash, widening credit spreads, a rally in the price \nof gold and a devaluation of the euro. In addition, the eurozone \ncrisis scenario assumes the default of a small number of our mar-\nket counterparties that we believe would be severely affected by a \ndefault across the selected European countries. These counter-\nparties are assumed to default as we believe that they would be \nthe most affected institutions because of their direct presence in \nthe relevant countries and their direct exposures. Through these \nprocesses, revaluation and redenomination risks on our expo-\nsures are considered on a regular basis by our risk management \nfunction.\n\n180\n\nRisk management\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nPresentation of selected European credit risk exposures\nThe basis for the presentation of the country exposure is our \ninternal risk domicile view. The risk domicile view is based on the \ndomicile of the legal counterparty, i.e., it may include exposure to \na legal entity domiciled in the reported country even if its parent is \nlocated outside of the country.\n\nThe credit risk exposure in the table is presented on a risk-based \nview before deduction of any related allowance for loan losses. \nWe present our credit risk exposure and related risk mitigation for \nthe following distinct categories:\np  Gross credit risk exposure includes the principal amount of \n\nloans drawn, letters of credit issued and undrawn portions of \ncommitted facilities, the PRV of derivative instruments after \nconsideration of legally enforceable netting agreements, the \nnotional value of investments in money market funds and the \nmarket values of securities financing transactions and the \ndebt cash trading portfolio (short-term securities) netted at the \nissuer level.\n\np  Risk mitigation includes CDS and other hedges, at their net \n\nnotional amount, guarantees, insurance and collateral (primar-\nily cash, securities and, to a lesser extent, real estate, mainly \nfor exposures of our private banking, corporate and institu-\ntional businesses to corporates & other). Collateral values \napplied for the calculation of the net exposure are determined \nin accordance with our risk management policies and reflect \napplicable margining considerations.\n\np  Net credit risk exposure represents gross credit risk exposure \n\nnet of risk mitigation.\n\np  Inventory represents the long inventory positions in trading and \nnon-trading physical debt and synthetic positions, each at mar-\nket value, all netted at the issuer level. Physical debt is non-\nderivative debt positions (e.g., bonds), and synthetic positions \nare created through OTC contracts (e.g., CDS purchased and/\nor sold and total return swaps).\n\nCDS presented in the risk mitigation column are purchased as a \ndirect hedge to our OTC exposure and the risk mitigation impact \nis considered to be the notional amount of the contract for risk \npurposes, with the mark-to-market fair value of CDS risk-man-\naged against the protection provider. Net notional amounts of \nCDS reflect the notional amount of CDS protection purchased \nless the notional amount of CDS protection sold and are based \non the origin of the CDS reference credit, rather than that of the \nCDS counterparty. CDS included in the inventory column repre-\nsent contracts recorded in our trading books that are hedging the \ncredit risk of the instruments included in the inventory column and \nare disclosed on the same basis as the value of the fixed income \ninstrument they are hedging. \n\nWe do not have any tranched CDS positions on these European \ncountries and only an insignificant amount of indexed credit deriv-\natives is included in inventory.\n\nThe credit risk of CDS contracts themselves, i.e., the risk that \nthe CDS counterparty will not perform in the event of a default, is \nmanaged separately from the credit risk of the reference credit. \nTo mitigate such credit risk, generally all CDS contracts are col-\nlateralized. In addition, they are executed with counterparties with \nwhom we have an enforceable International Swaps and Deriva-\ntives Association (ISDA) master agreement that provides for daily \nmargining.\n\nDevelopment of selected European credit risk exposures\nOn a gross basis, before taking into account risk mitigation, our \nrisk-based sovereign credit risk exposure to Cyprus, Croatia, \nGreece, Ireland, Italy, Malta, Portugal and Spain increased 11% \nto EUR\xc2\xa03,350 million as of December\xc2\xa031, 2018, compared to \nEUR\xc2\xa03,008 million as of December\xc2\xa031, 2017. Our net expo-\nsure to these sovereigns was EUR\xc2\xa02,640 million, 80% higher \ncompared to EUR\xc2\xa01,463 million as of December\xc2\xa031, 2017. Our \nnon-sovereign risk-based credit risk exposure in these coun-\ntries as of December\xc2\xa031, 2018 included net exposures to finan-\ncial institutions of EUR\xc2\xa02,462 million, 30% higher compared to \nDecember\xc2\xa031, 2017, and net exposures to corporates and other \ncounterparties of EUR\xc2\xa02,869 million, 20% higher compared to \nDecember\xc2\xa031, 2017.\n\nA significant majority of the purchased credit protection is trans-\nacted with central counterparties or banks outside of the dis-\nclosed countries. For credit protection purchased from central \ncounterparties or banks in the disclosed countries, such credit \nrisk is reflected in the gross and net exposure to each respective \ncountry.\n\nSovereign debt rating developments\nFrom year-end 2017 through February\xc2\xa028, 2019, the long-term \nsovereign debt ratings of the countries listed in the table changed \nas follows: Standard\xc2\xa0&\xc2\xa0Poor\xe2\x80\x99s increased Croatia\xe2\x80\x99s rating from BB \nto BB+, increased Cyprus\xe2\x80\x99 rating from BB+ to BBB-, increased \nGreece\xe2\x80\x99s rating from B- to B+ and increased Spain\xe2\x80\x99s rating from \nBBB+ to A-.

We have provided these \nrepresentations and warranties relating to sales of loans to institu-\ntional investors, primarily banks, and non-agency, or private label, \nsecuritizations. The loans sold are primarily loans that we have \npurchased from other parties. The scope of representations and \nwarranties, if any, depends on the transaction, but can include: \nownership of the mortgage loans and legal capacity to sell the \nloans; loan-to-value ratios and other characteristics of the prop-\nerty, the borrower and the loan; validity of the liens securing the \nloans and absence of delinquent taxes or related liens; conformity \nto underwriting standards and completeness of documentation; \nand origination in compliance with law. If it is determined that rep-\nresentations and warranties were breached, we may be required \nto repurchase the related loans or indemnify the investors to \nmake them whole for losses. Whether we will incur a loss in con-\nnection with repurchases and make whole payments depends on: \n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nthe extent to which claims are made; the validity of such claims \nmade within the statute of limitations (including the likelihood \nand ability to enforce claims); whether we can successfully claim \nagainst parties that sold loans to us and made representations \nand warranties to us; the residential real estate market, including \nthe number of defaults; and whether the obligations of the securi-\ntization vehicles were guaranteed or insured by third parties.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cRepresentations and warranties on residential mortgage loans sold\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nin Note 33 \xe2\x80\x93 Guarantees and commitments in VI \xe2\x80\x93 Consolidated financial \nstatements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group for further information.\n\nInvolvement with special purpose entities\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into transactions with, \nand make use of, SPEs.

We know that transparent disclo-\nsure of our governance helps stakeholders assess the quality of \nthe Group\xe2\x80\x99s corporate governance and assists investors in their \ninvestment decisions.\n\nCorporate Governance developments\n\nDuring 2018, the Group\xe2\x80\x99s corporate governance continued to \nalign with the implementation of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s strategy and risk and \ncontrol framework. The key corporate governance developments \nfor the Group in 2018 and in early 2019 included:\np  The election of two new Group Board of Directors (Board) \n\nmembers, Michael Klein and Ana Paula Pessoa, at the 2018 \nAnnual General Meeting (AGM);\n\np  The appointment of Board member Andreas Gottschling as \n\nthe new Risk Committee Chair, succeeding Richard E.

These changes to the Executive Board \nbecame effective on February\xc2\xa026, 2019;\n\np  The Board\xe2\x80\x99s decision to establish a new Board committee, \nthe Conduct and Financial Crime Control Committee, effec-\ntive as of January 1, 2019, which will oversee the Group\xe2\x80\x99s \nfinancial crime compliance programs and the related initiatives \naimed at ensuring that the highest standards of conduct and \nvigilance are maintained throughout the Group. The Board \nhas appointed Urs Rohner to chair the Conduct and Financial \nCrime Control Committee;\n\np  The Board\xe2\x80\x99s decision to propose PricewaterhouseCoopers \n\nAG to succeed KPMG AG as the Group\xe2\x80\x99s new statutory audi-\ntor at the 2020 AGM, effective for the fiscal year ending \nDecember\xc2\xa031, 2020, concluding a tender for the Group audit \n\nmandate conducted by the Audit Committee in the second half \nof 2018;\n\np  The wind-down of the Strategic Resolution Unit as a separate \ndivision as of December\xc2\xa031, 2018, having achieved its targets;\n\np  The creation of a new role of conduct and ethics ombud-\nsperson to ensure appropriate senior management aware-\nness of and attention to claims of sexual harassment, which \nis accountable to the CEO and the Group Conduct and Ethics \nBoard; and\n\np  Continued progress in aligning and developing the governance \n\nof the Group\xe2\x80\x99s major subsidiaries, including changes in the \nnon-executive chairs of the boards of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s major sub-\nsidiaries in the US, the UK and Switzerland, in the context of \nboard succession planning at the subsidiary level.\n\nWe regularly monitor developments in corporate governance \nguidelines, regulations and best practice standards in all juris-\ndictions relevant to our business operations. In 2018, the Swiss \nparliament continued to debate the proposed revisions to Swiss \ncorporate law, which include proposals that impact executive \ncompensation, carrying over the regulations of the Swiss Ordi-\nnance Against Excessive Compensation with respect to Listed \nCorporations (Compensation Ordinance) into general Swiss \ncorporate law, shareholder meetings and gender diversity at the \nboard and executive board levels. In July 2018, the Financial \nReporting Council published a revised UK Corporate Governance \nCode, which became effective January\xc2\xa01, 2019. The revised \ncode sets standards of good governance practice, including in the \nareas of board leadership and effectiveness, remuneration, share-\nholder relations and corporate culture.\n\nCorporate Governance framework\n\nThe Group\xe2\x80\x99s corporate governance framework consists of its \ngoverning bodies and its corporate governance policies and pro-\ncedures, which define the competencies of the governing bodies \nand other corporate governance rules, as well as the practices \nto be followed throughout the Group, in line with Swiss corporate \nlaw and international best practice standards for corporate gover-\nnance.

The Compliance function succeeds the former Compliance and Regulatory Affairs function. Regulatory Affairs is no longer part of the Compliance \n\nfunction and now reports directly to the CEO.\n\nThe shareholders elect the members of the Board and the exter-\nnal auditors on an annual basis and approve required resolutions \nat the AGM, such as the consolidated financial statements, capi-\ntal increases and Board and Executive Board compensation. The \nBoard is responsible for the overall strategic direction, supervi-\nsion and control of the Group and appoints the members of the \nExecutive Board. The Executive Board is responsible for the day-\nto-day operational management of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s business and for \ndeveloping and implementing business plans.\n\nThe Group is engaged in the banking business and is structured \ninto five business divisions \xe2\x80\x93 Swiss Universal Bank; International \nWealth Management; Asia Pacific; Global Markets; and Invest-\nment Banking & Capital Markets. In the fourth quarter of 2015, \nwe formed the Strategic Resolution Unit to oversee the effective \nwind-down of businesses and positions that did not fit our stra-\ntegic direction in the most efficient manner possible. Beginning \nin 2019, the Strategic Resolution Unit has ceased to exist as a \nseparate division of the Group. The residual portfolio remaining as \nof December 31, 2018 is now managed in an Asset Resolution \nUnit (ARU) and will be separately disclosed within the Corpo-\nrate Center. The divisions are supported by corporate functions \nthat provide infrastructure and services and have internal con-\ntrol responsibilities. The Group\xe2\x80\x99s banking business is carried out \nthrough its legal entities, which are operational in various jurisdic-\ntions and subject to the governance rules and supervision of the \nregulators in those jurisdictions. The Group has identified certain \nmajor subsidiary companies, which, in aggregate, account for a \nsignificant proportion of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s business operations. These \nmajor subsidiaries are Credit Suisse (Schweiz) AG, Credit Suisse \nHoldings (USA) Inc., Credit Suisse International and Credit Suisse \n\nSecurities (Europe) Ltd., all subsidiaries of Credit Suisse AG. Cor-\nporate governance at these major subsidiaries is closely aligned \nwith the Group\xe2\x80\x99s corporate governance.\n\nThe Group\xe2\x80\x99s corporate governance framework is depicted in the \nchart above.

We do so based on a broad understanding of our duties as \na financial services provider and employer and as an integral part \nof the economy and society. This approach also reflects our com-\nmitment to protecting the environment. We publish a Corporate \nResponsibility Report each year and aim to focus our corporate \nresponsibility reporting activities on topics that are relevant to our \nbusiness and our stakeholders, including through a materiality \nassessment that we undertake in order to identify critical eco-\nnomic, environmental and social issues.\n\nThe Group\xe2\x80\x99s reporting on corporate responsibility reflects the GRI \nStandards for sustainability reporting (Core option) while also pro-\nviding information on the progress we have made in implementing \nthe Ten Principles of the United Nations (UN) Global Compact \nas well as examples of how we can contribute to the realiza-\ntion of the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

The launch of a similar share buyback program is \nexpected for 2020, subject to approval by the Board; the level \nof the buyback for 2020 will be set in light of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s capital \nplans and subject to prevailing market conditions, but is expected \nto be in line with our intention to distribute at least 50% of net \nincome.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cShare repurchases\xe2\x80\x9d in III \xe2\x80\x93 Treasury, Risk, Balance sheet and Off-\n\nbalance sheet \xe2\x80\x93 Capital management for further information.\n\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cNote 15 \xe2\x80\x93 Share capital, conditional, conversion and authorized \n\ncapital of Credit Suisse Group\xe2\x80\x9d in VII \xe2\x80\x93 Parent company financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 \nCredit Suisse Group and our AoA (Articles 26, 26c and 27) for information on \nchanges to our capital structure during the year.\n\n           \n\nNumber of   \nshareholders   \n\n   \n%   \n\nNumber of   \nshares   \n\n2018   \n   \n%   \n\n           \n\nNumber of   \nshareholders   \n\n   \n%   \n\nNumber of   \nshares   \n\n109,205   \n99,472   \n9,733   \n3,206   3\n2,773   \n433   \n112,411   \n102,245   \n9,178   \n144   \n844   \n\xe2\x80\x93   \xe2\x80\x93\n\xe2\x80\x93   \xe2\x80\x93\n\n201,455,312   \n97   \n178,240,134   7\n88   \n9   \n23,215,178   \n    1,274,073,707   \n291,385,944   \n2   \n0   \n982,687,763   \n100    1,475,529,019   \n469,626,078   \n91   \n623,937,087   \n8   \n356,918,183   \n0   \n1   \n25,047,671   \n    1,080,482,701   \n    2,556,011,720   \n\n8   \n   \n1   \n50   \n11   \n38   \n58   \n18   \n24   \n14   \n1   \n42   \n100   \n\n108,856   \n99,164   \n9,692   \n3,283   3\n2,827   3\n456   \n112,139   \n101,991   \n9,175   \n162   \n811   \n\xe2\x80\x93   \xe2\x80\x93\n\xe2\x80\x93   \xe2\x80\x93\n\n178,205,123   7\n97   \n157,977,712   6\n88   \n9   \n20,227,411   \n    1,266,696,202   \n290,518,357   \n   \n0   \n976,177,845   \n100    1,444,901,325   \n448,496,069   \n91   \n610,345,374   \n8   \n362,822,676   \n0   \n1   \n23,237,206   \n    1,111,110,395   \n    2,556,011,720   \n\n2017 \n \n% \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n1 \n50 \n11 \n38 \n57 \n18 \n24 \n14 \n1 \n43 \n100 \n\nDistribution of Group shares\nend of\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\nDistribution of Group shares\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPrivate investors\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which Switzerland\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which foreign\xc2\xa0 \nInstitutional investors\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which Switzerland\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which foreign\xc2\xa01 \nShares registered in share register\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which Switzerland\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which Europe\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which US\xc2\xa01 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which other\xc2\xa0 \nShares not registered in share register\xc2\xa0 \nTotal shares issued\xc2\xa0 \n\n1 Includes shares issued in the form of ADS.\n\n192\n\nCorporate Governance\n\n\x0c \n\nDistribution of institutional investors in share register by industry\nend of\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\nNumber of   \nshareholders   \n\n           \n\n   \n%   \n\nNumber of   \nshares   \n\n2018   \n   \n%   \n\n           \n\nNumber of   \nshareholders   \n\nInstitutional investors by industry\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBanks\xc2\xa0 \nInsurance companies\xc2\xa0 \nPension funds\xc2\xa0 \nInvestment trusts\xc2\xa0 \nOther trusts\xc2\xa0 \nGovernmental institutions\xc2\xa0 \nOther\xc2\xa01 \nDirect entries\xc2\xa0 \nFiduciary holdings\xc2\xa0 \nTotal institutional investors\xc2\xa0 \n\n21   \n83   3\n431   \n371   \n524   \n22   \n1,642   \n3,094   \n112   3\n3,206   \n\n1   \n   \n13   \n12   \n16   \n1   \n51   \n97   \n   \n\n1,235,285   \n17,129,086   \n62,737,967   \n207,173,146   \n9,247,355   \n646,705   \n157,040,518   \n455,210,062   \n818,863,645   \n100    1,274,073,707   \n\n0   \n1   \n5   \n16   \n1   \n0   \n12   \n36   \n64   \n100   \n\n20   \n77   \n449   \n391   \n552   \n23   \n1,657   \n3,169   \n114   3\n3,283   \n\n \n\n2017 \n \n% \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n0 \n1 \n5 \n18 \n1 \n0 \n13 \n38 \n62 \n100 \n\n \n\n   \n%   \n\nNumber of   \nshares   \n\n1   \n2   \n14   \n12   \n17   \n1   \n50   \n97   \n   \n\n795,084   \n16,310,918   \n60,280,116   \n233,752,140   \n9,160,647   \n648,134   \n161,226,970   \n482,174,009   \n784,522,193   \n100    1,266,696,202   \n\nRounding differences may occur.\n1 Includes various other institutional investors for which a breakdown by industry type was not available.\n\nThrough the use of an external global market intelligence firm, \nwe regularly gather additional information on the composition of \nour shareholder base, including information on shares that are \nnot registered in our share register. According to this data, our \nshareholder base as of December 31, 2018 comprised 88% insti-\ntutional investors, with around half of such investors located in \nNorth America.

The purpose of such engagements is to understand \nthe perspectives of its shareholders, exchange views about the \nGroup\xe2\x80\x99s strategy, financial performance, corporate governance \nand compensation and other matters of importance to the Group \nor its shareholders. Shareholder engagement meetings may be \nattended by the Chairman of the Board (Chairman), the Com-\npensation Committee Chair, the CEO, CFO and other members \nof the Board or senior management. The responsibility for share-\nholder engagement is overseen by our Investor Relations depart-\nment. The Group aims to ensure that all shareholders receive the \n\nrelevant information they need to keep abreast of current Group \ndevelopments and make informed decisions.\n\nInformation policy\nWe are committed to an open and fair information policy with \nour shareholders and other stakeholders. Our Investor Relations \nand Corporate Communications departments are responsible for \naddressing inquiries received. All Group shareholders registered \nin our share register receive an invitation to our AGM, including an \norder form to receive the annual report and other reports. Each \nregistered shareholder may elect to receive the quarterly reports \non our financial performance. All of these reports and other infor-\nmation can be accessed on our website at credit-suisse.com/\ninvestors.\n\nNotices required under Swiss law\nNotices to shareholders required under Swiss law are made by \npublication in the Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce. The Board \nmay designate further means of communication for publishing \nnotices to shareholders. Notices required under the listing rules of \nthe SIX will either be published in two Swiss newspapers in Ger-\nman and French and sent to the SIX or otherwise communicated \nto the SIX in accordance with applicable listing rules. The SIX \nmay further disseminate the relevant information.\n\nSignificant shareholders\nUnder the Swiss Federal Act on Financial Market Infrastructure \nand Market Conduct in Securities and Derivative Trading (FMIA), \nanyone holding shares in a company listed on the SIX is required \nto notify the company and the SIX if their holding reaches, falls \nbelow or exceeds the following thresholds: 3%, 5%, 10%, 15%, \n20%, 25%, 331\xe2\x81\x843%, 50% or 662\xe2\x81\x843% of the voting rights entered \ninto the commercial register, whether or not the voting rights \ncan be exercised (that is, notifications must also include certain \nderivative holdings such as options or similar instruments). Fol-\nlowing receipt of such notification, the company has an obligation \nto inform the public. In addition, pursuant to the Swiss Code of \nObligations, a company must disclose in the notes to its annual \nconsolidated financial statements the identity of any shareholders \n\nCorporate Governance\n\n193\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nwho own in excess of 5% of its shares. The following provides an \noverview of the holdings of our significant shareholders, including \nany rights to purchase or dispose of shares, based on the most \nrecent disclosure notifications. In line with the FMIA require-\nments, the percentages indicated below were calculated in rela-\ntion to the share capital reflected in the AoA at the time of the \ndisclosure notification. As shareholders are only required to notify \nthe company and the SIX if their holding reaches, falls below or \nexceeds the thresholds listed above, the percentage holdings of \nour significant shareholders may vary at any given time compared \nto the date of submission of the most recent notification for these \nrespective shareholders. The full text of all notifications can be \nfound on our website at credit-suisse.com/shareholders. Each \nshare entitles the holder to one vote, except as described below.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cNote 3 \xe2\x80\x93 Business developments, significant shareholders and sub-\n\nsequent events\xe2\x80\x9d in VI \xe2\x80\x93 Consolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse \nGroup for further information on significant shareholders.\n\nThe Group also holds positions in its own shares, including \nshares acquired through the share buyback program described \nabove, which are subject to the same disclosure requirements as \n\nsignificant external shareholders. These positions fluctuate and, in \naddition to the activity from our share buyback program, primarily \nreflect activities related to market making, facilitating client orders \nand satisfying the obligations under our employee compensa-\ntion plans. Shares held by the Group have no voting rights. As of \nDecember\xc2\xa031, 2018, our holdings amounted to 2.78% purchase \npositions (0.15% registered shares and 2.636% share acquisition \nrights) and 4.87% sales positions (disposal rights), mainly related \nto the Group\xe2\x80\x99s outstanding tier\xc2\xa01 capital instruments, which would \nbe converted into Group ordinary shares upon the occurrence of \ncertain specified triggering events. As a result of the share buy-\nback program for 2019, the Group\xe2\x80\x99s purchase positions in its own \nshares are expected to increase steadily during 2019.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cIssuances and redemptions\xe2\x80\x9d in III \xe2\x80\x93 Treasury, Risk, Balance sheet and \n\nOff-balance sheet \xe2\x80\x93 Capital management for further information.\n\nCross shareholdings\n\nThe Group has no cross shareholdings in excess of 5% of capital \nor voting rights with any other company.\n\nSignificant shareholders\n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\nDecember 31, 2018 or the most recent notification date\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \nQatar Investment Authority (registered entity \xe2\x80\x93 Qatar Holding LLC)\xc2\xa0 \nNorges Bank\xc2\xa0 \nThe Olayan Group (registered entity \xe2\x80\x93 Competrol Establishment)\xc2\xa0 \nBlackRock Inc.\xc2\xa0 \nHarris Associates L.P.\xc2\xa0 \nDodge & Cox\xc2\xa0 \nSilchester International Investors LLP\xc2\xa0 \n\nDecember 31, 2017 or the most recent notification date\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \nNorges Bank\xc2\xa0 \nQatar Investment Authority (registered entity \xe2\x80\x93 Qatar Holding LLC)\xc2\xa0 \nThe Olayan Group (registered entity \xe2\x80\x93 Crescent Holding GmbH)\xc2\xa0 \nBlackRock Inc.\xc2\xa0 \nHarris Associates L.P.\xc2\xa0 \nCapital Group Companies, Inc.\xc2\xa0 \n\nDecember 31, 2016 or the most recent notification date\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \nThe Olayan Group (registered entity \xe2\x80\x93 Crescent Holding GmbH)\xc2\xa0 \nNorges Bank\xc2\xa0 \nQatar Investment Authority (registered entity \xe2\x80\x93 Qatar Holding LLC)\xc2\xa0 \nCapital Group Companies, Inc.\xc2\xa0 \nHarris Associates L.P.\xc2\xa0 \nBlackRock Inc.\xc2\xa0 \n\nGroup publication   \nof notification   \n\nNumber of   \nshares (million)   \n\nApproximate   \nshareholding %   1 \n\nPurchase rights \n% \n\nSeptember 6, 2018   \nFebruary 15, 2018   \nDecember 12, 2018   \nSeptember 2, 2017   \nNovember 9, 2013   4 \nDecember 28, 2018   5 \nDecember 7, 2018   \n\nFebruary 15, 2018   \nAugust 16, 2017   \nJune 2, 2017   \nSeptember 2, 2017   \nNovember 9, 2013   \nOctober 31, 2017   \n\nSeptember 16, 2016   \nDecember 3, 2016   \nNovember 16, 2016   \nJanuary 28, 2017   \nNovember 9, 2013   \nJanuary 25, 2013   \n\n133.2   \n127.4   \n126.0   \n86.9   \n81.5   \n78.2   \n77.4   \n\n127.4   \n126.2   \n106.6   \n86.9   \n81.5   \n76.6   \n\n111.3   \n104.4   \n103.0   \n96.7   \n81.5   \n38.6   \n\n5.21   \n4.98   \xe2\x80\x93\n4.93   \n4.17   \xe2\x80\x93\n5.17   \xe2\x80\x93\n3.06   \xe2\x80\x93\n3.03   \xe2\x80\x93\n\n4.98   \xe2\x80\x93\n4.94   \n4.93   \n4.17   \xe2\x80\x93\n5.17   \xe2\x80\x93\n3.01   \xe2\x80\x93\n\n5.41   \n4.99   \xe2\x80\x93\n4.93   \n4.91   \xe2\x80\x93\n5.17   \xe2\x80\x93\n3.01   \xe2\x80\x93\n\n \n \n \n \n\n0.39   2\n \n\n0.07   3\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n10.97 \n5.29 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n5.31 \n \n\n12.81 \n \n\n \n\n \n\n1 The approximate shareholding percentages were calculated in relation to the share capital at the time of the relevant disclosure notification.

The following information summarizes certain \nshareholder rights at the Group.\n\nVoting rights and transfer of shares\nThere is no limitation under Swiss law or the AoA on the right to \nown Group shares.\n\nIn principle, each share represents one vote at the AGM. Shares \nheld by the Group have no voting rights. Shares for which a single \nshareholder or shareholder group can exercise voting rights may \nnot exceed 2% of the total outstanding share capital, unless one \nof the exemptions discussed below applies. The restrictions on \nvoting rights do not apply to:\np  the exercise of voting rights by the independent proxy as \n\nelected by the AGM;\n\np  shares in respect of which the shareholder confirms to us that \nthe shareholder has acquired the shares in the shareholder\xe2\x80\x99s \nname for the shareholder\xe2\x80\x99s own account and in respect of which \nthe disclosure requirements in accordance with the FMIA and the \nrelevant ordinances and regulations have been fulfilled; or\n\np  shares that are registered in the name of a nominee, provided \nthat this nominee is willing to furnish us, on request, the name, \naddress and shareholdings of any beneficial owner or group \nof related beneficial owners on behalf of whom the nominee \nholds 0.5% or more of the total outstanding share capital of \nthe Group.\n\nTo execute voting rights, shares need to be registered in the \nshare register directly or in the name of a nominee. In order to be \nregistered in the share register, the purchaser must file a share \nregistration form with the depository bank. The registration of \nshares in the share register may be requested at any time. Fail-\ning such registration, the purchaser may not vote or participate in \nshareholders\xe2\x80\x99 meetings. However, each shareholder, whether reg-\nistered in the share register or not, is entitled to receive dividends or \nother distributions approved at the AGM. Transfer restrictions apply \nregardless of the way and the form in which the registered shares \nare kept in the accounts and regardless of the provisions applica-\nble to transfers. The transfer of intermediated securities based on \nGroup shares, and the pledging of these intermediated securities as \ncollateral, is based on the provisions of the Swiss Federal Intermedi-\nated Securities Act. The transfer or pledging of shares as collateral \nby means of written assignment is not permitted.\n\nAnnual General Meeting\nWe encourage shareholders to participate at our AGM. Under \nSwiss law, the AGM must be held within six months of the end \nof the fiscal year. Notice of an AGM, including agenda items and \nproposals submitted by the Board and by shareholders, must be \npublished in the Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce at least 20 \ndays prior to the AGM.\n\nShares only qualify for voting at an AGM if they are registered in \nthe share register with voting rights no later than three days prior \nto the AGM.\n\nConvocation of shareholder meetings\nThe AGM is convened by the Board or, if necessary, by the statu-\ntory auditors, with 20 days\xe2\x80\x99 prior notice. The Board is further \nrequired to convene an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM) \nif so resolved at a shareholders\xe2\x80\x99 meeting or if so requested by \nshareholders holding in aggregate at least 10% of the nominal \nshare capital. The request to call an EGM must be submitted in \nwriting to the Board, and, at the same time, Group shares repre-\nsenting at least 10% of the nominal share capital must be depos-\nited for safekeeping. The shares remain in safekeeping until the \nday after the EGM.\n\nRequest to place an item on the agenda\nShareholders holding shares with an aggregate nominal value \nof at least CHF\xc2\xa040,000 have the right to request that a specific \nitem be placed on the agenda and voted upon at the AGM. The \nrequest to include a particular item on the agenda, together with \na relevant proposal, must be submitted in writing to the Board \nno later than 45 days before the meeting and, at the same \ntime, Group shares with an aggregate nominal value of at least \nCHF\xc2\xa040,000 must be deposited for safekeeping. The shares \nremain in safekeeping until the day after the AGM.\n\nQuorum requirements\nThe AGM may, in principle, pass resolutions without regard to the \nnumber of shareholders present at the meeting or represented by \nproxy, except as discussed below. Resolutions and elections gen-\nerally require the approval of a majority of the votes represented \nat the meeting, except as otherwise provided by mandatory provi-\nsions of law or by the AoA.\n\nShareholders\xe2\x80\x99 resolutions that require a vote by a majority of the \nvotes represented include:\np  amendments to the AoA, unless a supermajority is required;\np  election of members of the Board, the Chairman, the mem-\n\nbers of the Compensation Committee, the independent proxy \nand statutory auditors;\n\np  approval of the compensation of the members of the Board \n\nand the Executive Board;\n\np  approval of the annual report and the statutory and consoli-\n\ndated accounts;\n\np  discharge of the acts of the members of the Board and Execu-\n\ntive Board; and\n\np  determination of the appropriation of retained earnings.\n\nA quorum of at least two-thirds of the votes represented is \nrequired for resolutions on:\np  change of the purpose of the company;\np  creation of shares with increased voting powers;\np  implementation of transfer restrictions on shares;\np  increase in conditional and authorized capital;\np  increase of capital by way of conversion of capital surplus or by \n\ncontribution in kind;\n\nCorporate Governance\n\n195\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\np  restriction or suspension of pre-emptive rights;\np  change of location of the principal office; and\np  dissolution of the company without liquidation.\n\nadopted at a shareholders\xe2\x80\x99 meeting with a supermajority may, \nhowever, limit or suspend pre-emptive rights in certain limited \ncircumstances.\n\nA quorum of at least half of the total share capital and approval \nby at least three-quarters of the votes represented is required for \nresolutions on:\np  the conversion of registered shares into bearer shares;\np  amendments to the AoA relating to registration and voting \n\nrights of nominee holders; and\np  the dissolution of the company.\n\nA quorum of at least half of the total share capital and the \napproval of at least seven-eighths of the votes cast is required for \namendments to provisions of the AoA relating to voting rights.\n\nSay on pay\nIn accordance with the Swiss Code of Best Practice for Corpo-\nrate Governance, the Group submitted the compensation report \n(contained in the Compensation section of the Annual Report) for \na consultative vote by shareholders at the 2018 AGM. In accor-\ndance with the Compensation Ordinance, the Group will submit \nthe following Board and Executive Board compensation recom-\nmendations for binding votes by shareholders at the 2019 AGM:\np  For the Board: a maximum amount of compensation for the \nBoard for the period from the 2019 AGM to the 2020 AGM;\n\np  For the Executive Board: an aggregate amount of variable \n\ncompensation in the form of short-term incentive (STI) awards \nto be granted to Executive Board members for the 2018 finan-\ncial year;\n\np  For the Executive Board: a maximum amount of fixed compen-\n\nsation for the Executive Board for the period from the 2019 \nAGM to the 2020 AGM; and\n\np  For the Executive Board: an aggregate amount of variable \n\ncompensation in the form of long-term incentive (LTI) awards \nto be granted to Executive Board members for the 2019 finan-\ncial year (based on fair value at grant).\n\nIn line with current practice, the Group will continue to submit the \ncompensation report for a consultative vote by shareholders.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cV \xe2\x80\x93 Compensation\xe2\x80\x9d for further information on the binding vote.\n\nDischarge of the acts of the Board and the Executive \nBoard\nAccording to Swiss law, the AGM has the power to discharge the \nactions of the members of the Board and the Executive Board. \nThe 2018 AGM granted discharge to the members of the Board \nand the Executive Board for the 2017 financial year.\n\nPre-emptive rights\nUnder Swiss law, any share issue, whether for cash or non-cash \nconsideration or no consideration, is subject to the prior approval \nof the shareholders. Shareholders of a Swiss corporation have \ncertain pre-emptive rights to subscribe for new issues of shares \nin proportion to the nominal amount of shares held. A resolution \n\nDuty to make an offer\nSwiss law provides that anyone who, directly or indirectly or acting \nin concert with third parties, acquires 331\xe2\x81\x843% or more of the voting \nrights of a listed Swiss company, whether or not such rights are \nexercisable, must make an offer to acquire all of the listed equity \nsecurities of such company, unless the AoA of the company pro-\nvides otherwise. Our AoA does not include a contrary provision. \nThis mandatory offer obligation may be waived under certain cir-\ncumstances by the Swiss Takeover Board or the Swiss Financial \nMarket Supervisory Authority FINMA (FINMA). If no waiver is \ngranted, the mandatory offer must be made pursuant to proce-\ndural rules set forth in the FMIA and implementing ordinances.\n\nClauses on changes in control\nTo the best of our knowledge, there are no agreements in place \nthat could lead to a change in control of the Group. Subject to \ncertain provisions in the Group\xe2\x80\x99s employee compensation plans, \nwhich allow for the Compensation Committee or Board to deter-\nmine the treatment of outstanding awards for all employees, \nincluding the Executive Board members, in the case of a change \nin control, there are no provisions that require the payment of \nextraordinary benefits in the agreements and plans benefiting \nmembers of the Board and the Executive Board or any other \nmembers of senior management. Specifically, there are no con-\ntractually agreed severance payments in the case of a change in \ncontrol of the Group.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cContract lengths, termination and change in control provisions\xe2\x80\x9d in V \n\xe2\x80\x93 Compensation \xe2\x80\x93 Executive Board compensation for 2017 for further informa-\ntion on the clauses on changes in control.\n\nBorrowing and raising funds\nNeither Swiss law nor our AoA restrict our power to borrow and \nraise funds in any way. The decision to borrow funds is passed by \nor under the direction of our Board, with no shareholders\xe2\x80\x99 resolu-\ntion required.\n\nLiquidation\nUnder Swiss law and our AoA, the Group may be dissolved at any \ntime by a shareholders\xe2\x80\x99 resolution which must be passed by:\np  a supermajority of at least three-quarters of the votes cast at \n\nthe meeting in the event the Group were to be dissolved by \nway of liquidation; and\n\np  a supermajority of at least two-thirds of the votes represented \nand an absolute majority of the par value of the shares repre-\nsented at the meeting in other cases.\n\nDissolution by order of FINMA is possible if we become bankrupt. \nUnder Swiss law, any surplus arising out of liquidation (after the \nsettlement of all claims of all creditors) is distributed to sharehold-\ners in proportion to the paid-up par value of shares held.\n\n196\n\nCorporate Governance\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nBoard of Directors\nGeneral information\n\nMembership and qualifications\nThe AoA provide that the Board shall consist of a minimum of seven \nmembers. The Board currently consists of 12 members. We believe \nthat the size of the Board must be such that the committees can \nbe staffed with qualified members. At the same time, the Board \nmust be small enough to ensure an effective and rapid decision-\nmaking process. Board members are elected at the AGM by our \nshareholders individually for a period of one year and are eligible for \nre-election. Shareholders will also elect a member of the Board as \nthe Chairman and each of the members of the Compensation Com-\nmittee for a period of one year. One year of office is understood to \nbe the period of time from one AGM to the close of the next AGM. \nMembers of the Board shall generally retire after having served on \nthe Board for 12 years. Under certain circumstances, the Board \nmay extend the limit of terms of office for a particular Board mem-\nber for a maximum of three additional years.\n\nAn overview of the Board and the committee membership is \nshown in the following table. The composition of the Boards of \nthe Group and the Bank is identical.\n\nBoard composition and succession planning\nThe Governance and Nominations Committee (formerly Chair-\nman\xe2\x80\x99s and Governance Committee) regularly considers the com-\nposition of the Board as a whole and in light of staffing require-\nments for the committees. The Governance and Nominations \nCommittee recruits and evaluates candidates for Board member-\nship based on criteria as set forth by the OGR. The Governance \nand Nominations Committee may also retain outside consultants \nwith respect to the identification and recruitment of potential new \nBoard members. In assessing candidates, the Governance and \nNominations Committee considers the requisite skills and char-\nacteristics of Board members as well as the composition of the \nBoard as a whole. Among other considerations, the Governance \nand Nominations Committee takes into account skills, manage-\nment experience, independence and diversity in the context of the \nneeds of the Board to fulfill its responsibilities. The Governance \nand Nominations Committee also considers other activities and \ncommitments of an individual in order to be satisfied that a pro-\nposed member of the Board can devote enough time to a Board \nposition at the Group.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cMandates\xe2\x80\x9d for further information.\n\nMembers of the Board of Directors\n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\nBoard   \nmember   \nsince   \n\n    Governance and   \nNominations   \n   \nIndependence   \nCommittee   \n\n   \n\nConduct and   \nAudit    Compensation    Financial Crime   \nCommittee   1 \n\nCommittee   \n\n   \n\nCommittee   \n\nElected at 2018 AGM\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \n \n \n2009   \nUrs Rohner, Chairman\xc2\xa0 \n2012   \nIris Bohnet\xc2\xa0 \n2017   \nAndreas Gottschling\xc2\xa0 \n2016   \nAlexander Gut\xc2\xa0 \n2018   \nMichael Klein\xc2\xa0 \n2009   \nAndreas N.

The Board is composed \nof individuals with wide-ranging professional expertise in key \nareas including finance and financial management, risk manage-\nment, audit, innovation and technology, legal, compliance and \nregulatory affairs, advertising, marketing and media, and human \nresources and incentive structures. Diversity of culture, experi-\nence and opinion are important aspects of Board composition, as \nwell as gender diversity. While the ratio of female-to-male Board \nmembers may vary in any given year, the Board is committed to \nmaintaining a good gender balance over the long term. The col-\nlective experience and expertise of our Board members as of the \nend of 2018 across those key areas considered particularly rel-\nevant for the Group is illustrated in the following chart.\n\nIn areas where the Board\xe2\x80\x99s collective experience and expertise \nmay require strengthening, the Board may either decide to nomi-\nnate a new Board member candidate with specialist expertise, \nengage outside experts or take other measures. For example, \nafter former Board member and technology expert Sebastian \nThrun stepped down from the Board in 2016, the Board estab-\nlished the interdisciplinary Innovation and Technology Committee \nas an advisory body to further the Group\xe2\x80\x99s strategic goals with \nrespect to innovation and technology. Mr. Thrun was retained in \nan advisory capacity to chair the committee, which includes an \nexternal cybersecurity expert and regularly engages internal tech-\nnology experts.\n\nBoard member experience and expertise\n(Number and percentage of Board members)\n\nLeadership development \nexperience\nExperience in international \nbusiness / organization\nFinance /  \nfinancial management expertise\nExecutive-level role in financial \nindustry (>10 years) \nNon-executive listed company \nBoard member\nExecutive-level role in non- \nfinancial industry (>10 years)\nRisk, audit and/or compliance \nexpertise\nInnovation, technology and/or \nmedia expertise\n\n100%\n\n100%\n\n77%\n\n62%\n\n54%\n\n38%\n\n38%\n\n31%\n\n198\n\nCorporate Governance\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nTo maintain a high degree of expertise, diversity and indepen-\ndence in the future, the Board has a succession planning pro-\ncess in place to identify potential candidates for the Board at an \nearly stage. With this process, we are well prepared when Board \nmembers rotate off the Board. The objectives of the succession \nplanning process are to ensure adequate representation of key \nBoard competencies and a Board composition that is well-suited \nto address future challenges, while maintaining the stability and \nprofessionalism of the Board. Potential candidates are evaluated \naccording to criteria defined to assess the candidates\xe2\x80\x99 expertise \nand experience, which include the following:\np  proven track record as an executive with relevant leadership \n\ncredentials gained in an international business environment in \nfinancial services or another industry;\n\np  relevant functional skills and credentials in the key areas listed \n\nabove;\n\np  understanding of global banking, financial markets and finan-\n\ncial regulation;\n\np  broad international experience and global business per-\n\nspective, with a track record of having operated in multiple \ngeographies;\n\np  ability to bring insight and clarity to complex situations and to \n\nboth challenge and constructively support management;\n\np  high level of integrity and affinity with the Group\xe2\x80\x99s values and \n\ncorporate culture; and\n\np  willingness to commit sufficient time to prepare for and attend \n\nBoard and committee meetings.\n\nThe evaluation of candidates also considers formal indepen-\ndence and other criteria for Board membership, consistent with \nlegal and regulatory requirements and the Swiss Code of Best \nPractice for Corporate Governance. Furthermore, we believe that \nother aspects, including team dynamics and personal reputation \nof Board members, play a critical role in ensuring the effective \nfunctioning of the Board. This is why the Group places the utmost \nimportance on the right mix of personalities who are also fully \ncommitted to making their blend of specific skills and experience \navailable to the Board.\n\nWhile the Board is continually engaged in considering poten-\ntial candidates throughout the year, succession planning for the \nnext year is typically kicked off at the Board\xe2\x80\x99s annual strategy \noffsite, which is held mid-year. In addition to its discussions of the \nGroup\xe2\x80\x99s strategy, the Board holds a dedicated session on cor-\nporate governance, at which, among other topics, current Board \ncomposition and future needs are discussed, including the needs \nfor suitable Board committee composition. Based on the out-\ncome of these discussions, the interest and availability of certain \n\ncandidates will be explored further. The Board\xe2\x80\x99s discussions will \ncontinue at its annual self-assessment session, which usually \ntakes place at year-end, and it will consider specific changes in \nBoard composition to be proposed at the next AGM. The Board \nwill ultimately approve candidates to be nominated as new Board \nmembers for election at the AGM at its February or March meet-\nings, shortly before the publication of this report.\n\nNew members and continuing training\nAny newly appointed member is required to participate in an \norientation program to become familiar with our organizational \nstructure, strategic plans, significant financial, accounting and \nrisk issues and other important matters relating to the gover-\nnance of the Group. The orientation program is designed to take \ninto account the new Board member\xe2\x80\x99s individual background \nand level of experience in each specific area. Moreover, the pro-\ngram\xe2\x80\x99s focus is aligned with any committee memberships of the \nperson concerned. Board members are encouraged to engage in \ncontinuing training. The Board and the committees of the Board \nregularly ask specialists within the Group to speak about specific \ntopics in order to enhance the Board members\xe2\x80\x99 understanding of \nissues that already are, or may become, of particular importance \nto our business.\n\nMeetings\nIn 2018, the Board held six meetings in person and four addi-\ntional meetings. In addition, the Board held a two and a half-day \nstrategy session. The members of the Board are encouraged to \nattend all meetings of the Board and the committees on which \nthey serve.\n\nAll members of the Board are expected to spend the necessary \ntime outside of these meetings needed to discharge their respon-\nsibilities appropriately. The Chairman calls the meeting with suffi-\ncient notice and prepares an agenda for each meeting. However, \nany other Board member has the right to call an extraordinary \nmeeting, if deemed necessary. The Chairman has the discretion \nto invite members of management or others to attend the meet-\nings. Generally, the members of the Executive Board attend part \nof the meetings to ensure effective interaction with the Board. \nThe Board also holds separate private sessions without manage-\nment present. Minutes are kept of the proceedings and resolu-\ntions of the Board.\n\nFrom time to time, the Board may make certain decisions via circu-\nlar resolution, unless a member asks that the matter be discussed \nin a meeting and not decided upon by way of written consent.\n\nCorporate Governance\n\n199\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nMeeting attendance \xe2\x80\x93 Board and Board committees \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\nBoard of   \nDirectors   1 \n\n    Governance and   \nNominations   \nCommittee   2 \n\n   \n\n   \nAudit    Compensation   \nCommittee   4 \n\nCommittee   3 \n\nin 2018\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \n \nTotal number of meetings held\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Number of members who missed no meetings\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Number of members who missed one meeting\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Number of members who missed two or more meetings\xc2\xa0 \nMeeting attendance, in %\xc2\xa0 \n\n11   \n12   6\n2   \n0   \n98   \n\n9   \n   \n0   \n1   \n93   \n\n18   \n5   \n1   \n1   \n97   \n\n9   6\n2   6\n1   \n1   \n92   \n\n \nRisk \nCommittee   5\n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n1 \n0 \n97 \n\nMeeting attendance is shown for the calendar year 2018, which spans two Board periods.

The Compensa-\ntion Ordinance sets out that companies must include provisions \nin their articles of association to define the activities that fall \nwithin the scope of a mandate and set limits on the number of \nmandates that board members and executive management may \nhold. According to the Group\xe2\x80\x99s AoA, mandates include activities \nin the most senior executive and management bodies of listed \ncompanies and all other legal entities that are obliged to obtain an \nentry in the Swiss commercial register or a corresponding foreign \nregister.\n\nThe limitations on mandates assumed by Board members outside \nof the Group are summarized in the table below.\n\n200\n\nCorporate Governance\n\nType of mandate and limitation \xe2\x80\x93 Board\nType of mandate\xc2\xa0 \nListed companies\xc2\xa0 \nOther legal entities\xc2\xa01 \nLegal entities on behalf of the Group\xc2\xa02 \nCharitable legal entities\xc2\xa03 \n\nLimitation \nNo more than four other mandates \nNo more than five mandates \nNo more than ten mandates \nNo more than ten mandates \n\n1 Includes private non-listed companies.\n2 Includes memberships in business and industry associations.\n3 Also includes honorary mandates in cultural or educational organizations.\n\nNo Board member holds mandates in excess of these restric-\ntions. The restrictions shown above do not apply to mandates of \nBoard members in legal entities controlled by the Group such as \nsubsidiary boards.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cAudit Committee\xe2\x80\x9d in Board committees for further information on lim-\n\nits on Audit Committee service.\n\nIndependence\n\nThe Board consists solely of non-executive directors within the \nGroup, of which at least the majority must be determined to be \nindependent. In its independence determination, the Board takes \ninto account the factors set forth in the OGR, the committee \ncharters and applicable laws and listing standards. Our indepen-\ndence standards are also periodically measured against other \nemerging best practice standards.\n\nThe Governance and Nominations Committee performs an annual \nassessment of the independence of each Board member and \nreports its findings to the Board for the final determination of inde-\npendence of each individual member. The Board has applied the \nindependence criteria of the SIX Exchange Directive on Information \nrelating to Corporate Governance, FINMA, the Swiss Code of Best \nPractice for Corporate Governance and the rules of the NYSE and \nthe Nasdaq Stock Market (Nasdaq) in determining the definition of \nindependence.\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nIndependence criteria applicable to all Board members\nIn general, a director is considered independent if the director:\np  is not, and has not been for the prior three years, employed as \nan executive officer or in another function at the Group or any \nof its subsidiaries;\n\np  is not, and has not been for the prior three years, an employee \n\nmanagement in connection with the duties of a Compensation \nCommittee member, including, but not limited to:\np  the source of any compensation of the Compensation Com-\nmittee member, including any consulting, advisory or other \ncompensatory fees paid by the Group to such director; and\np  whether the Compensation Committee member is affiliated \n\nor affiliate of our external auditor; and\n\np  does not maintain a material direct or indirect business rela-\n\ntionship with the Group or any of its subsidiaries.\n\nWhether or not a relationship between the Group or any of its \nsubsidiaries and a member of the Board is considered material \ndepends in particular on the following factors:\np  the volume and size of any transactions concluded in relation \nto the financial status and credit standing of the Board mem-\nber concerned or the organization in which he or she is a part-\nner, significant shareholder or executive officer;\n\np  the terms and conditions applied to such transactions in com-\nparison to those applied to transactions with counterparties of \na similar credit standing;\n\np  whether the transactions are subject to the same internal \n\napproval processes and procedures as transactions that are \nconcluded with other counterparties;\n\np  whether the transactions are performed in the ordinary course \n\nof business; and\n\np  whether the transactions are structured in such a way and on \nsuch terms and conditions that the transaction could be con-\ncluded with a third party on comparable terms and conditions.\n\nMoreover, a Board member is not considered independent if the \nBoard member is, or has been at any time during the prior three \nyears, part of an interlocking directorate in which a member of the \nExecutive Board serves on the compensation committee of another \ncompany that employs the Board member. Significant shareholder \nstatus is generally also not considered a criterion for independence \nunless the shareholding exceeds 10% of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s share capital \nor in instances where the shareholder may otherwise influence the \nGroup in a significant manner. Board members with immediate fam-\nily members who would not qualify as independent are also not con-\nsidered independent.\n\nSpecific independence considerations \nBoard members serving on the Audit Committee are subject to \nindependence requirements in addition to those required of other \nBoard members. None of the Audit Committee members may be \nan affiliated person of the Group or may, directly or indirectly, accept \nany consulting, advisory or other compensatory fees from us other \nthan their regular compensation as members of the Board and its \ncommittees.\n\nFor Board members serving on the Compensation Committee, \nthe independence determination considers all factors relevant to \ndetermining whether a director has a relationship with the Group \nthat is material to that director\xe2\x80\x99s ability to be independent from \n\nwith the Group, any of its subsidiaries or any affiliates of any of \nits subsidiaries.\n\nOther independence standards\nWhile the Group is not subject to such standards, the Board \nacknowledges that some proxy advisors apply different standards for \nassessing the independence of our Board members, including the \nlength of tenure a Board member has served, the full-time status of \na Board Member, annual compensation levels of Board members \nwithin a comparable range to executive pay or a Board member\xe2\x80\x99s \nformer executive status for periods further back than the preceding \nthree years.\n\nIndependence determination\nAs of December 31, 2018, all members of the Board were deter-\nmined by the Board to be independent.\n\nBoard leadership\n\nChairman of the Board\nThe Chairman is a non-executive member of the Board, in accor-\ndance with Swiss banking law, and performs his role on a full-\ntime basis, in line with the practice expected by FINMA, our main \nregulator. The Chairman:\np  coordinates the work within the Board;\np  works with the committee chairmen to coordinate the tasks of \n\nthe committees;\n\np  ensures that the Board members are provided with the infor-\n\nmation relevant for performing their duties;\n\np  drives the Board agenda;\np  drives key Board topics, especially regarding the strategic \n\ndevelopment of the Group, succession planning, the structure \nand organization of the Group, corporate governance, as well \nas compensation and compensation structure, including the \nperformance evaluation and compensation of the CEO and the \nExecutive Board;\n\np  chairs the Board, the Governance and Nominations Commit-\ntee, the Conduct and Financial Crime Control Committee and \nthe Shareholder Meetings;\n\np  takes an active role in representing the Group to key share-\nholders, investors, regulators and supervisors, industry asso-\nciations and other external stakeholders;\n\np  has no executive function within the Group;\np  with the exception of the Governance and Nominations Com-\nmittee and the Conduct and Financial Crime Control Commit-\ntee, is not a member of any of the other Board standing com-\nmittees; and\n\np  may attend all or parts of selected committee meetings as a \n\nguest without voting power.\n\nCorporate Governance\n\n201\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nVice-Chair\nThe Vice-Chair:\np  is a member of the Board;\np  is a designated deputy to the Chairman; and\np  assists the Chairman by providing support and advice to the \nChairman, assuming the Chairman\xe2\x80\x99s role in the event of the \nChairman\xe2\x80\x99s absence or indisposition and leading the Board \naccordingly.\n\nThere may be one or more Vice-Chairs. Severin Schwan currently \nserves as Vice-Chair.\n\nLead Independent Director\nAccording to the Group\xe2\x80\x99s OGR, the Board may appoint a Lead \nIndependent Director. If the Chairman is determined not to be \nindependent by the Board, the Board must appoint a Lead Inde-\npendent Director. The Lead Independent Director:\np  may convene meetings without the Chairman being present;\np  takes a leading role among the Board members, particularly \nwhen issues between a non-independent Chairman and the \nindependent Board members arise (for example, when the \nnon-independent Chairman has a conflict of interest);\n\np  leads the Board\xe2\x80\x99s annual assessment of the Chairman; and\np  ensures that the work of the Board and Board-related pro-\n\ncesses continue to run smoothly.\n\nSeverin Schwan currently also serves as the Lead Independent \nDirector.\n\nSegregation of duties\nIn accordance with Swiss banking law, the Group operates under \na dual board structure, which strictly segregates the duties of \nsupervision, which are the responsibility of the Board, from the \nduties of management, which are the responsibility of the Execu-\ntive Board. The roles of the Chairman (non-executive) and the \nCEO (executive) are separate and carried out by two different \npeople.\n\nBoard responsibilities \nIn accordance with the OGR, the Board delegates certain tasks \nto Board committees and delegates the management of the com-\npany and the preparation and implementation of Board resolu-\ntions to certain management bodies or executive officers to the \nextent permitted by law, in particular Article 716a and 716b of the \nSwiss Code of Obligations, and the AoA.\n\nWith responsibility for the overall direction, supervision and control \nof the company, the Board:\n\np  regularly assesses our competitive position and approves our \nstrategic and financial plans and risk appetite statement and \noverall risk limits;\n\np  receives a status report at each ordinary meeting on our finan-\n\ncial results, capital, funding and liquidity situation;\n\np  receives, on a monthly basis, management information pack-\nages, which provide detailed information on our performance \nand financial status, as well as quarterly risk reports outlining \nrecent developments and outlook scenarios;\n\np  is provided by management with regular updates on key issues \n\nand significant events, as deemed appropriate or requested;\n\np  has access to all information concerning the Group in order to \n\nappropriately discharge its responsibilities;\n\np  reviews and approves significant changes in our structure and \n\norganization;\n\np  approves the annual variable compensation pools for the \n\nGroup and the divisions and recommends total compensation \nof the Board and Executive Board for shareholder approval at \nthe AGM;\n\np  provides oversight on significant projects including acquisitions, \n\ndivestitures, investments and other major projects; and\n\np  along with its committees, is entitled, without consulting with \nmanagement and at the Group\xe2\x80\x99s expense, to engage external \nlegal, financial or other advisors, as it deems appropriate, with \nrespect to any matters within its authority.\n\nGovernance of Group subsidiaries\nThe Board assumes oversight responsibility for establishing \nappropriate governance for Group subsidiaries. The governance \nof the Group is based on the principles of an integrated oversight \nand management structure with global scope, which enables \nmanagement of the Group as one economic unit. The Group sets \ncorporate governance standards to ensure the efficient and har-\nmonized steering of the Group. In accordance with the OGR, the \nBoard appoints or dismisses the chairperson and the members \nof the board of directors of the major subsidiaries of the Group \nand approves their compensation. A policy naming the subsid-\niaries in scope and providing guidelines for the nomination and \ncompensation process is periodically reviewed by the Board. The \ngovernance of the major subsidiaries, subject to compliance with \nall applicable local laws and regulations, should be consistent with \nthe corporate governance principles of the Group, as reflected in \nthe OGR and other corporate governance documents. In order to \nfacilitate consistency and alignment of Group and subsidiary gov-\nernance, it is the Group\xe2\x80\x99s policy for the Board to appoint at least \none Group director to each of the boards of its major subsidiaries. \nDirectors and officers of the Group and its major subsidiaries are \ncommitted to ensuring transparency and collaboration throughout \nthe Group.\n\n202\n\nCorporate Governance\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nBoard evaluation\nThe Board performs a self-assessment once a year, where it \nreviews its own performance against the responsibilities listed \nin its charter and the Board\xe2\x80\x99s objectives and determines future \nobjectives, including any special focus objectives for the com-\ning year. The Chairman does not participate in the discussion of \nhis own performance. As part of the self-assessment, the Board \nevaluates its effectiveness with respect to a number of different \naspects, including board structure and composition, communica-\ntion and reporting, agenda setting and continuous improvement. \nFrom time to time, the Board may also mandate an external advi-\nsor to facilitate the evaluation process. The Board last mandated \nan external firm to perform a board effectiveness evaluation \ntoward the end of 2016, which included a comprehensive review \nof Board processes and documentation, interviews by the exter-\nnal assessor with the Chairman and the individual Board members \nand the participation of the external assessor as an observer in \nBoard and Board committee meetings. The results were pre-\nsented to the Board in 2017 and the Board continued to monitor \n\nprogress on the various recommendations made from the external \nevaluation during 2018. The Board agreed to target performing \nan external board effectiveness evaluation every three years.\n\nBoard changes\nAt the 2018 AGM, Michael Klein and Ana Paula Pessoa were \nelected as new members of the Board. Richard E. Thornburgh \nstepped down from the Board. The Board proposes Christian \nGellerstad, former CEO of Pictet Wealth Management, and Shan \nLi, CEO of Silk Road Finance Corporation Limited, for election \nas new non-executive Board members at the AGM on April\xc2\xa026, \n2019.

These committees are:\np  Capital Allocation & Risk Management Committee (CARMC): \n\nCARMC is responsible for overseeing and directing our risk \nprofile, recommending risk limits at the Group level to the Risk \nCommittee and the Board, establishing and allocating risk \nappetite among the various businesses, reviewing new sig-\nnificant business strategies or changes in business strategies \nincluding business migrations, making risk-related decisions \non escalations and for applying measures, methodologies \nand tools to monitor and manage the risk portfolio. CARMC \nmeets monthly and conducts reviews according to three rotat-\ning cycles: the asset & liability management cycle (chaired \nby the CFO), the market & credit risks cycle (chaired by the \nChief Risk Officer (CRO)) and the internal control system cycle \n(jointly chaired by the CRO and the Chief Compliance and \nRegulatory Affairs Officer (CCRO) or the Chief Compliance \nOfficer (CCO) since the organizational change on February\xc2\xa026, \n2019).\n\np  Valuation Risk Management Committee (VARMC): the \n\nVARMC (chaired by the CFO) is responsible for establish-\ning policies regarding the valuation of certain material assets \n\nand the policies and calculation methodologies applied in the \nvaluation process.

The Group CEB also oversees the activi-\nties of the newly established role of the conduct and ethics \nombudsperson.\n\nIn July 2018, the new role of conduct and ethics ombudsper-\nson was created as a result of a review of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s global \napproach to handling claims of sexual harassment. The review \nwas initiated by our Chief Executive Officer in March 2018 and \nled by our General Counsel and our Chief Compliance and Regu-\nlatory Affairs Officer and our Chief Human Resources Officer at \nthe time. The ombudsperson is accountable directly to the Chief \nExecutive Officer and the Group Conduct and Ethics Board. The \nombudsperson\xe2\x80\x99s role is to serve as a point of immediate escala-\ntion when sexual harassment claims arise and to ensure there \nis appropriate awareness of and attention to such claims. The \nombudsperson works with our Compliance, General Counsel and \nHuman Resources functions as well as our business divisions to \nreview our relevant global training programs, policies and proto-\ncols, so that they can be further enhanced as part of our efforts \nto prevent sexual harassment at work and to make sure all cases \nare managed in a fair, accurate and consistent way within our \nglobal framework.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cRisk management\xe2\x80\x9d in III \xe2\x80\x93 Treasury, Risk, Balance sheet and Off-\n\nbalance sheet for information on our risk management oversight.\n\n218\n\nCorporate Governance\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nExecutive Board mandates\n\nOur Executive Board members may, similar to our Board mem-\nbers, assume board or executive level or other roles in compa-\nnies and organizations outside of the Group, which are collec-\ntively referred to as mandates.

Many of the \nmembers of the Board and the Executive Board, their close family \nmembers or companies associated with them maintain banking \nrelationships with us. The Group or any of its banking subsidiar-\nies may from time to time enter into financing and other bank-\ning agreements with companies in which current members of \nthe Board or the Executive Board have a significant influence as \ndefined by the SEC, such as holding executive and/or board level \nroles in these companies. With the exception of the transac-\ntions described below, relationships with members of the Board \nor the Executive Board and such companies are in the ordinary \ncourse of business and are entered into on an arm\xe2\x80\x99s length basis. \nAlso, unless otherwise noted, all loans to members of the Board, \nmembers of the Executive Board, their close family members \nor companies associated with them were made in the ordinary \ncourse of business, were made on substantially the same terms, \nincluding interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the \ntime for comparable transactions with other persons and did not \ninvolve more than the normal risk of collectability or present other \nunfavorable features. As of December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, \nthere were no loan exposures to such related parties that were \nnot made in the ordinary course of business and at prevailing \nmarket conditions.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cBoard loans\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cExecutive Board loans (audited)\xe2\x80\x9d in V \xe2\x80\x93 Compen-\nsation \xe2\x80\x93 Board of Directors compensation and \xe2\x80\x93 Executive Board compensa-\ntion for 2018, respectively, for the outstanding loans to members of the Board \nand the Executive Board.\n\nRelated party transactions\n\nTier\xc2\xa01 capital instruments\nBeginning in February 2011, the Group entered into agreements \nwith entities affiliated with Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) and \nThe Olayan Group, each of which has significant holdings of \nGroup shares and other Group financial products, to purchase \ntier\xc2\xa01 high-trigger capital instruments. The agreements were sub-\nsequently amended in 2012 and 2013.\n\nIn October 2018, the Group redeemed the following tier\xc2\xa01 high-\ntrigger capital instruments:\np  USD\xc2\xa01.725 billion, 9.5%, held by an affiliate of The Olayan \n\nGroup;\n\np  USD\xc2\xa01.72 billion, 9.5%, held by an affiliate of QIA; and\np  CHF\xc2\xa02.5 billion, 9.0%, held by an affiliate of QIA.\n\nAt the time of the original transaction, the Group determined that \nthis was a material transaction and deemed QIA and The Olayan \nGroup to be related parties of our then Board members Jassim \nBin Hamad J.J. Al\xc2\xa0Thani and Aziz R.D. Syriani for purposes of \nevaluating the terms and corporate governance of the original \ntransaction. At that time, the Board (except for Mr. Bin Hamad \nJ.J. Al Thani and Mr. Syriani, who abstained from participating \n\nin the determination process) determined that the terms of the \noriginal transaction, given its size, the nature of the contingent \ncapital instrument, for which there was no established mar-\nket, and the terms of the notes issued and held by QIA and The \nOlayan Group, were fair. As of April\xc2\xa026, 2013 and April\xc2\xa028, 2017, \nrespectively, Mr. Syriani and Mr. Bin Hamad J.J. Al Thani retired \nfrom the Board and no other person affiliated with The Olayan \nGroup or with QIA has been elected as a Board member.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cNote 30 \xe2\x80\x93 Related parties\xe2\x80\x9d in VI \xe2\x80\x93 Consolidated financial statements \n\n\xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group for further information on related party transactions.\n\nOther\nIn December 2018, a subsidiary of the Group executed a transac-\ntion with an affiliate to sell a minority interest in a trading platform \nfor a gain of approximately USD\xc2\xa080 million.\n\nExternal Audit\n\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cAudit Committee\xe2\x80\x9d in Board of Directors \xe2\x80\x93 Board committees for fur-\n\nther information on the responsibilities of the audit committee.\n\nExternal audit forms an integral part of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s corporate \ngovernance framework and plays a key role by providing an inde-\npendent assessment of our operations and internal controls.\n\nThe AGM elects the external auditors annually. Our statutory \nauditor is KPMG AG (KPMG), Badenerstrasse\xc2\xa0172, 8004 Zurich, \nSwitzerland. The mandate was first given to KPMG for the busi-\nness year 1989/1990. The lead audit partners are subject to \nperiodic rotation requirements. The lead Group engagement part-\nners are Anthony Anzevino, Global Lead Partner (since 2012) and \nNicholas Edmonds, Group Engagement Partner (since 2016).\n\nIn 2018, upon the recommendation of the Audit Committee, the \nBoard proposed PricewaterhouseCoopers as the new statutory \nauditor at the 2020 AGM, effective for the fiscal year ending \nDecember\xc2\xa031, 2020 and subject to shareholder approval.\n\nIn addition, we have mandated BDO AG, Fabrikstrasse\xc2\xa050, 8031 \nZurich, Switzerland, as special auditor for the purposes of issuing \nthe legally required report for capital increases in accordance with \nArticle 652f of the Swiss Code of Obligations, mainly relating to \nthe valuation of companies in consideration of the qualified capital \nincreases involving contributions in kind.\n\nAudit committee pre-approval policy\nThe Audit Committee monitors and pre-approves the fees to be \npaid to KPMG for its services. It has developed and approved \na policy on the engagement of public accounting firms that is \ndesigned to help ensure that the independence of the external \nauditor is maintained at all times.\n\nThe policy limits the scope of services that the external auditor \nmay provide to us or any of our subsidiaries in connection with its \naudit and stipulates certain permissible types of non-audit ser-\nvices, including audit-related services, tax services and other ser-\nvices that have been pre-approved by the Audit Committee. The \n\nCorporate Governance\n\n227\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nAudit Committee pre-approves all other services on a case-by-\ncase basis. The external auditor is required to report periodically \nto the Audit Committee about the scope of the services it has \nprovided and the fees for the services it has performed to date.\n\nThe following are the significant differences between our corporate \ngovernance standards and the corporate governance standards \napplicable to US domestic issuers listed on the NYSE and Nasdaq:\np  Approval of employee benefit plans: NYSE and Nasdaq stan-\n\nFees paid to external auditors\nin\xc2\xa0 \n\n2018  \n\n2017    % change \n\n \n\nFees paid to external auditors (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \n \nAudit services\xc2\xa01 \nAudit-related services\xc2\xa02 \nTax services\xc2\xa03 \n\n49.8  \n5.7  \n3.0  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n51.4   \n7.2   \n3.3   \n\n(3) \n(21) \n(9) \n\n1 Audit services include the integrated audit of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s consolidated and statutory \n\nfinancial statements, interim reviews and comfort and consent letters. Additionally they \ninclude all assurance and attestation services related to the regulatory filings of the Group \nand its subsidiaries. Audit fees exclude value-added taxes.\n\n2 Audit-related services are primarily in respect of: (i) reports related to the Group\xe2\x80\x99s compli-\n\nance with provisions of agreements or calculations required by agreements; (ii) account-\ning advice; (iii) audits of private equity funds and employee benefit plans; and (iv) regula-\ntory advisory services.\n\n3 Tax services are in respect of tax compliance and consultation services, including: (i) \n\npreparation and/or review of tax returns of the Group and its subsidiaries;  \n(ii) assistance with tax audits and appeals; and (iii) confirmations relating to the Qualified \nIntermediary status of Group entities.\n\nKPMG attends all meetings of the Audit Committee and reports \non the findings of its audit and/or interim review work. The Audit \nCommittee reviews KPMG\xe2\x80\x99s audit plan on an annual basis and \nevaluates the performance of KPMG and its senior representa-\ntives in fulfilling their responsibilities. Moreover, the Audit Commit-\ntee recommends to the Board the appointment or replacement of \nthe external auditor, subject to shareholder approval as required \nby Swiss law.\n\nKPMG provides a report as to its independence to the Audit \nCommittee at least once a year. In accordance with our pre-\napproval policy and as in prior years, all KPMG non-audit services \nprovided in 2018 were pre-approved. KPMG is required to report \nto the Audit Committee periodically regarding the extent of ser-\nvices provided by KPMG and the fees for the services performed \nas of that date.\n\nOther information\n\nComplying with rules and regulations\nWe fully adhere to the principles set out in the Swiss Code of \nBest Practice for Corporate Governance, dated August 28, 2014, \nincluding its appendix stipulating recommendations on the process \nfor setting compensation for the Board and the Executive Board.\n\nIn connection with our primary listing on the SIX, we are subject \nto the SIX Directive on Information relating to Corporate Gover-\nnance, dated March 20, 2018. Our shares are also listed on the \nNYSE in the form of ADS and certain of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s exchange \ntraded notes are listed on Nasdaq. As a result, we are subject \nto certain US rules and regulations. We adhere to the NYSE\xe2\x80\x99s \nand Nasdaq\xe2\x80\x99s corporate governance listing standards (NYSE and \nNasdaq standards), with a few exceptions where the rules are not \napplicable to foreign private issuers.\n\n228\n\nCorporate Governance\n\ndards require shareholder approval of the establishment of, \nand material revisions to, certain equity compensation plans. \nWe comply with Swiss law, which requires that shareholders \napprove the creation of conditional capital used to allow for \nthe issuance of shares for employee benefit plans and other \nequity compensation plans, but does not require shareholders \nto approve the terms of those plans.\n\np  Risk assessment and risk management: NYSE standards \n\nallocate to the Audit Committee responsibility for the discus-\nsion of guidelines and policies governing the process by which \nrisk assessment and risk management is undertaken, while at \nthe Group these duties are assumed by the Risk Committee. \nWhereas our Audit Committee members satisfy the NYSE as \nwell as Nasdaq independence requirements, our Risk Commit-\ntee may include non-independent members.\n\np  Independence of nominating and corporate governance commit-\n\ntee: NYSE and Nasdaq standards require that all members of \nthe nominating and corporate governance committee be inde-\npendent. The Group\xe2\x80\x99s Governance and Nominations Commit-\ntee is currently composed entirely of independent members, but \naccording to its charter, may include non-independent members.\n\np  Reporting: NYSE standards require that certain board com-\nmittees report specified information directly to shareholders, \nwhile under Swiss law only the Board reports directly to the \nshareholders and the committees submit their reports to the \nfull Board.\n\np  Appointment of the external auditor: NYSE and Nasdaq stan-\n\ndards require that an Audit Committee of a listed company \ncomply with and have the authority necessary to comply with \nthe requirements of Rule 10A-3 of the Securities Exchange \nAct of 1934. Rule 10A-3 requires the Audit Committee to be \ndirectly responsible for the appointment, compensation, reten-\ntion and oversight of the external auditor unless there is a \nconflicting requirement under home country law. Under Swiss \nlaw, the appointment of the external auditor must be approved \nby the shareholders at the AGM based on the proposal of the \nBoard, which receives the advice and recommendation of the \nAudit Committee.\n\np  Audit Committee charter: Nasdaq standards require the Audit \nCommittee to review and assess the adequacy of its charter \non an annual basis, while our Audit Committee\xe2\x80\x99s charter only \nrequires review and assessment from time to time.\n\np  Executive sessions: NYSE and Nasdaq standards require the \nboard of directors to meet regularly in executive sessions com-\nposed solely of independent directors. Our Board meets regularly \nin executive sessions comprising all directors, including any direc-\ntors determined to be not independent. If any item discussed at \nthe meeting raises a conflict of interest for any of our directors, \nhowever, such director does not participate in the related deci-\nsion making. In line with Swiss law, the Board does not include \nany directors who are also members of management.\n\np  Quorums: Nasdaq standards require that the company\xe2\x80\x99s by-\n\nlaws provide for a quorum of at least 331\xe2\x81\x843% of the outstanding \n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nshares of the company\xe2\x80\x99s common stock for any meeting of the \nholders of common stock. The Group\xe2\x80\x99s AoA call for a quorum \nin certain instances, but do not require a quorum of 331\xe2\x81\x843% or \ngreater of the holders of the outstanding shares of common \nstock for any meeting of shareholders.\n\np  Independence: NYSE and Nasdaq independence standards \n\nspecify thresholds for the maximum permissible amount of \n(i) direct compensation that can be paid by the company to \na director or an immediate family member thereof, outside of \nsuch director\xe2\x80\x99s directorship fees and other permitted payments; \nand (ii) payments between the company and another com-\npany at which such director or an immediate family member \nthereof is an executive officer, controlling shareholder, partner or \nemployee. Our independence standards do not specify thresh-\nolds for direct compensation or cross-company revenues, but \nconsider these facts in the overall materiality of the business \nrelationship determination for independence purposes.\n\nFiduciary duties and indemnification\nThe Swiss Code of Obligations requires directors and members \nof senior management to safeguard the interests of the corpora-\ntion and, in connection with this requirement, imposes the duties of \ncare and loyalty on directors and members of senior management. \nWhile Swiss law does not have a general provision on conflicts of \ninterest, the duties of care and loyalty are generally understood to \ndisqualify directors and members of senior management from par-\nticipating in decisions that could directly affect them. Directors and \nmembers of senior management are personally liable to the corpo-\nration for any breach of these provisions.\n\nThe Group\xe2\x80\x99s AoA and the Bank\xe2\x80\x99s AoA do not contain provisions \nregarding the indemnification of directors and officers. According \nto Swiss statutory law, an employee has a right to be indemnified \nby the employer against losses and expenses incurred by such \nperson in the execution of such person\xe2\x80\x99s duties under an employ-\nment agreement, unless the losses and expenses arise from \nthe employee\xe2\x80\x99s gross negligence or willful misconduct. It is our \npolicy to indemnify current and former directors and/or employ-\nees against certain losses and expenses in respect of service as \na director or employee of the Group, one of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s affiliates \nor another entity that we have approved, subject to specific condi-\ntions or exclusions. We maintain directors\xe2\x80\x99 and officers\xe2\x80\x99 insurance \nfor our directors and officers.\n\nFees and charges for holders of ADS\nIn November 2016, the Group entered into a deposit agreement \nwith The Bank of New York Mellon as depositary for the ADS \n(Depositary). In accordance with the deposit agreement, the \nDepositary may charge holders of our ADS, either directly or indi-\nrectly, fees or charges up to the amounts described below.\n\nThe Depositary collects its fees and related expenses for the \ndelivery and surrender of ADS directly from investors deposit-\ning or surrendering ADS for the purpose of withdrawal or from \nintermediaries acting for them. The Depositary collects fees and \nexpenses for making distributions to holders by deducting those \nfees and expenses from the amounts distributed or by selling a \nportion of distributable property to pay the fees and expenses. \nThe Depositary may generally refuse to provide fees and \nexpenses until its fees for those services are paid.\n\nFees and charges for holders of ADS\n\nFees\xc2\xa0 \nUSD 5 (or less) per 100 ADS \xc2\xa0 \n(or portion thereof)\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \nUSD 0.05 (or less) per ADS\xc2\xa0 \nRegistration or transfer fees\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\nCharges\xc2\xa0 \nExpenses of the Depositary\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \nTaxes and other governmental \xc2\xa0 \ncharges\xc2\xa0 \nOther charges\xc2\xa0 \n\nFor the issuance of ADS, including issuances resulting from a distribution of shares, share dividends, share splits \xc2\xa0\nand other property; for ADS issued upon the exercise of rights; and for the surrender of ADS for cancellation \xc2\xa0\nand withdrawal of shares.\xc2\xa0\nFor any distribution of cash to ADS registered holders, including upon the sale of rights or other entitlements.\xc2\xa0\nFor the transfer and registration of shares on our share register to or from the name of the Depositary or its agent \xc2\xa0\nwhen the holder deposits or withdraws shares.\xc2\xa0\n\nFor cable and facsimile transmissions (when expressly provided in the deposit agreement); and for converting \xc2\xa0\nforeign currency to US dollars.\xc2\xa0\nPaid, as necessary, to the Depositary or the custodian who pays certain charges on any ADS or share underlying \xc2\xa0\nan ADS, for example, stock transfer taxes, stamp duty or applicable interest or penalty thereon.\xc2\xa0\nPaid, as necessary, to the Depositary or its agents for servicing the deposited shares.\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n\xc2\xa0\n\nAmounts paid by the Depositary to the Group\nIn 2018, in accordance with the deposit agreement, the Deposi-\ntary made payments to the Group in an aggregated amount of \nUSD\xc2\xa0400 million, including for the reimbursement of expenses \nrelating to its ADS program. The Depositary has also contractu-\nally agreed to provide certain ADS program-related services free \nof charge.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, including removal of the Depositary \nor termination of the ADS program by the Group, the Group is \nrequired to repay certain amounts paid to the Group and to com-\npensate the Depositary for payments made or services provided \non behalf of the Group.\n\nCorporate Governance\n\n229\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\n[this page intentionally left\xc2\xa0blank]\n\n230\n\nCorporate Governance\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nV \xe2\x80\x93 Compensation\n\nLetter from the Chair of the \nCompensation\xc2\xa0Committee\t\n\nCompensation design  \n\nCompensation governance \n\nExecutive Board compensation for 2018 \n\nExecutive\tBoard\t\tcompensation\xc2\xa0design\t\nfor 2019  \n\nBoard of Directors compensation \n\nGroup compensation \n\nReport of the Statutory Auditor \n\n \n\n232\n\n237\n\n239\n\n241\n\n249\n\n251\n\n255\n\n264\n\n231\n\n\x0c \n\nCompensation\n\nLetter from the Chair of the \nCompensation\xc2\xa0Committee\n\nKai S. Nargolwala\nChair of the  \nCompensation Committee\n\nDear shareholders \n\nAs Chair of the Compensation Committee of the Board of Direc-\ntors (Compensation Committee), I am pleased to present to you \nthe 2018 Compensation Report. The changes that we introduced \nlast year to the structure and presentation of the report were well \nreceived, and we have retained and built on this approach for the \n2018 Compensation Report. \n\nKey compensation and performance highlights \n\nFor 2018, the Compensation Committee reviewed not only the \nperformance during the year, but also the level of achievement of \nthe three-year restructuring program over the years 2016, 2017 \nand 2018. When the program was announced in October 2015, \nthere were three main objectives. Firstly, there were some urgent \nmatters to be addressed, namely the capital position, the abso-\nlute level of risk, and the cost base. Secondly, the Group defined \n\n \n\na strategy to be a leading wealth manager with strong invest-\nment banking capabilities for sustainable, compliant and profitable \ngrowth. Thirdly, the goal was to significantly upgrade our risk and \ncompliance controls and to improve our culture. Some of the ways \nin which senior management has successfully addressed these \nobjectives are reflected in the table and charts below, as well as \nin the following Group performance highlights: \np  Achieved first annual post-tax profit since 2014, with \n\nCHF\xc2\xa02.02 billion of net income attributable to shareholders; \np  Significantly strengthened the Group\xe2\x80\x99s capital position, with \na look-through common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio of 12.6% \nat the end of 2018 compared with 11.4% at the end of 2015, \nand as demonstrated by the launch of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s share buy-\nback program of up to CHF\xc2\xa01.5 billion for 2019; \n\np  Reduced the adjusted operating cost base by CHF\xc2\xa04.6 billion \nsince 2015, exceeding the target of costs below CHF\xc2\xa017 bil-\nlion for 2018. This protected the Group\xe2\x80\x99s returns and profit-\nability as  revenues came under pressure in the second half of \n2018 due to market conditions; \n\np  Successfully closed the Strategic Resolution Unit and sig-\nnificantly de-risked the Global Markets businesses, which \n positioned the Group well to weather the widening of credit \nspreads in the fourth quarter of 2018; \n\np  Rebalanced the Group\xe2\x80\x99s activities to shift capital towards the \nWealth Management-related and Investment Banking & Capi-\ntal Markets businesses, which typically generate higher returns \nand are less volatile; and \n\np  Took a number of steps to improve risk and compliance \n\ncontrols, including increasing our headcount in compliance, \ndecreasing the number of high severity compliance incidents, \nimplementing a single client view, and introducing other mea-\nsures focused on further enhancing the conduct and ethics \nculture of the Group. \n\nKey\tfinancial\tand\tstrategic\tachievements\tin\t2018\n\n\xc2\xa0 \n\n2018  \n\n2017   Change    Change \n\n \n\n \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n \n\n \n\nFinancial performance (in CHF billion)\xc2\xa0 \n \nReported income before taxes\xc2\xa0 \nAdjusted income before taxes\xc2\xa0 \nAdjusted net revenues\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which Wealth Management-related\xc2\xa01 \nAdjusted operating cost base\xc2\xa0 \nNet new assets from Wealth Management\xc2\xa02 \n\n \n\n3.4  \n4.2  \n20.8  \n13.2  \n16.5  \n34.4  \n\n \n1.8  \n2.8  \n20.9  \n12.9  \n18.0  \n37.2  \n\n \n\n \n\n+1.6    +88% \n+1.4    +52% \n0% \n-0.1   \n+0.3   \n+2% \n-8% \n-1.5   \n-2.8   \n-8% \n\n\xc2\xa0\n\n \n\nStrategic initiatives \n\xc3\x87  Achieved external cost target of < CHF 17 billion\xc2\xa0\n\xc3\x87  Closed down the Strategic Resolution Unit\xc2\xa0\n\xc3\x87  Launched share buyback\xc2\xa0\n \n \n\xc3\x87  compared with 49% in 2015\xc2\xa0\n\xc3\x87  De-risked Global Markets activities since 2015\xc2\xa0\n\xc3\x87  Significantly upgraded compliance and control frameworks\xc2\xa0\n\nIncreased capital consumption of Wealth Management-related1 \xc2\xa0\nand Investment Banking & Capital Markets businesses to 68% in 2018, \xc2\xa0\n\nAdjusted results are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items included in our reported results.

Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cReconciliation of adjusted results\xe2\x80\x9d in I \xe2\x80\x93 \n\nInformation on the company \xe2\x80\x93 Strategy and II \xe2\x80\x93 Operating and financial review \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse for further information. 2015 adjusted income before taxes excludes a \ngoodwill impairment of CHF 3,797 million, major litigation provisions of CHF 820 million, restructuring expenses of CHF 355 million, a positive fair value impact from \nmovements in own credit spreads of CHF 298 million, real estate gains of CHF 95 million and gains from business sales of CHF 34 million.\n\nMarket conditions in the second half of 2018 became more chal-\nlenging for the financial services industry, with a significant drop \nin client activity resulting from a combination of factors includ-\ning increasing trade tensions, rising US interest rates and greater \ngeopolitical uncertainty. Against the backdrop of these conditions, \nthe Compensation Committee decided to keep the Group variable \nincentive compensation pool stable to the previous year, notwith-\nstanding an increase in adjusted income before taxes of 52% over \nthe same period, to protect returns and profitability in light of down-\nward pressure on revenues during the second half of the year. \n > Refer to the \xe2\x80\x9cGroup compensation and benefits expense\xe2\x80\x9d table and \xe2\x80\x9cDetermi-\nnation of variable incentive compensation pools\xe2\x80\x9d in Group Compensation for \nfurther information. \n\nThe Group variable incentive compensation pool includes the \namounts for the Executive Board and the CEO. Although the \noverall pool is stable compared with the previous year, differ-\nentiation has been made such that high-performing employees \nreceived year-on-year increases in variable incentive compensa-\ntion to reflect their contribution to the Group\xe2\x80\x99s improved financial \nperformance. In addition, as a result of high deferral rates and the \ngranting of share-based deferred awards, the realized compen-\nsation of senior employees and the Executive Board members is \naligned with shareholders\xe2\x80\x99 interests.\n\nThe Group\xe2\x80\x99s key financial and strategic achievements and overall \nperformance during 2018 were taken into consideration by the \nBoard of Directors (Board) in its approval of the following compen-\nsation decisions for the Group and the Executive Board: \np  Group variable incentive compensation pool of CHF\xc2\xa03,195 mil-\n\nlion, stable compared with the prior year, while taking the oppor-\ntunity to increase the level of differentiation for high performers; \np  Total aggregate Executive Board compensation of CHF\xc2\xa093.49 \nmillion, 17% higher than the prior year (before the 40% volun-\ntary reduction in the 2017 long-term incentive (LTI) maximum \nopportunity); and \n\np  Total CEO compensation of CHF\xc2\xa012.65 million, 13% higher \n\nthan the prior year (before the 40% voluntary reduction in the \n2017 LTI maximum opportunity).\n\n2018 compensation decisions\n\nGroup compensation\nThe Group takes a total compensation approach, whereby fixed \nand variable compensation are assessed in total at the individual \nlevel to determine an appropriate balance between the two compo-\nnents. Overall Group compensation and benefits expense for 2018 \ndecreased by 7%, from CHF\xc2\xa010,367 million in 2017 to CHF\xc2\xa09,620 \nmillion.\n\nIn addition to the Group\xe2\x80\x99s financial performance in 2018, the \nCompensation Committee considered a range of other factors \nin determining the Group\xe2\x80\x99s variable incentive compensation pool. \nThese included progress made against strategic objectives, relative \nperformance, market position and market trends, as well as control, \nrisk, compliance and ethical considerations. Taking all of these fac-\ntors into account, the Board approved a total Group variable incen-\ntive compensation pool of CHF\xc2\xa03,195 million, stable compared with \n2017. \n\nCompensation\n\n233\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nExecutive Board compensation\nTotal aggregate Executive Board compensation for 2018 is \nCHF\xc2\xa093.49 million, which is comprised of: \np  CHF\xc2\xa029.20 million total fixed compensation; \np  CHF\xc2\xa030.56 million total 2018 short-term incentive (STI) \n\naward, subject to shareholder approval at the 2019 AGM; \np  CHF\xc2\xa033.73 million total 2018 LTI award at fair value at the \ntime of grant, with a maximum opportunity of CHF\xc2\xa058.5 mil-\nlion, as approved at the 2018 AGM. \n\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cExecutive Board compensation for 2018\xe2\x80\x9d for further information. \n\nTotal Executive Board compensation \nin CHF million\n\n+17%\n\n+31%\n\n+20%\n\n+1%\n\nLTI awards\n\nSTI awards\n\nFixed  \ncompensation\n\n80.2\n\n25.8\n\n25.5\n\n28.9\n\n2017 \n\n(pre-40% LTI award voluntary \n\nreduction)\n\n93.5\n\n33.7\n\n30.6\n\n29.2\n\n2018\n\nCompared with the amount for 2017, before the voluntary 40% \nreduction in the LTI maximum opportunity, total compensation for \n2018 is 17% higher than the prior year. The main drivers of this \nchange are improved performance in exceeding the cost target and \nsignificantly higher profitability as reflected in the 2018 STI awards, \nincreases to the maximum opportunities for certain selected \nExecutive Board members based on role expansion and scope of \nresponsibilities, and a higher fair value for the 2018 LTI awards \ncalculated by one of the major international accounting firms. It \nis important to note that taking the Executive Board as a whole \n(excluding the CEO), maximum opportunities average 54% of the \nSTI cap of 2.5 times base salary and 55% of the LTI cap of 4.25 \ntimes base salary. \n\nThe year-on-year change in Executive Board compensation dis-\nclosed for 2018 is largely driven by the 2018 LTI award, which was \napproved at the 2018 AGM. The drivers of the higher LTI award \namount are the return to the LTI opportunity levels before the vol-\nuntary 40% reduction that was reflected in the 2017 LTI award, \nincreases to the maximum opportunities of selected Executive \nBoard members and a higher fair valuation of the awards.\n\nAs part of the annual review and assessment of market bench-\nmarking data, the maximum opportunities of certain individual \nmembers were adjusted to better reflect the expansion of their \nroles and responsibilities, and in a small number of cases, to more \n\nclosely align with the increased market value of such roles. While \nthe review of benchmarking data is an annual process, adjustments \nto maximum opportunities are made selectively and do not happen \nfrequently for individual Executive Board members.\n\nThe STI award amount is determined based on performance \nagainst financial and non-financial metrics. The financial metrics \n(662\xe2\x81\x843% weighting) consist of pre-defined performance levels for \nadjusted income before taxes and a cost target, and the Group\xe2\x80\x99s \nfinancial performance in 2018 resulted in a payout of approximately \n85% of the maximum opportunity for the financial performance \ncomponent. The non-financial metrics (331\xe2\x81\x843% weighting) cover \nstrategic repositioning, client focus/quality of business/innovation, \ntalent management, risk and regulatory, conduct and ethics, and \nteamwork and leadership. As described in more detail later in this \nreport, the Compensation Committee considered the performance \nof each Executive Board member against individual metrics related \nto the above mentioned six broad categories, and determined that \nas a whole, the Executive Board (excluding the CEO) achieved \napproximately 89% of the maximum opportunity for the non-finan-\ncial performance component of the total STI award pool. The over-\nall amount represents, on average, 87% of the pre-defined maxi-\nmum opportunity of each Executive Board member.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cExecutive Board compensation for 2018\xe2\x80\x9d for further information on \n\nthe 2018 STI award financial and non-financial performance assessments.\n\nFor the Executive Board compensation framework, the variable \ncompensation elements are comprised of STI and LTI opportu-\nnities, which at their maximum potential value represent 78% of \ntotal compensation. To align with the Group\xe2\x80\x99s longer-term strategy, \napproximately two-thirds of the variable maximum opportunity is \nin the form of the LTI award and one-third in the form of the STI \naward. The cash-based STI award achievement level is assessed \nagainst pre-determined financial and non-financial performance \ntargets applicable to the financial year. The share-based LTI award \nutilizes metrics which are aligned to longer-term shareholder objec-\ntives, including relative total shareholder return (RTSR), return on \ntangible equity (RoTE) and tangible book value per share (TBVPS) \nperformance targets over a three-year period. The number of \nshares that may vest is determined based on achievement of per-\nformance targets at the end of the performance period, and can-\nnot exceed the maximum number of shares granted. The value of \nthe LTI award is further subject to the prevailing share price on the \ndates the shares are settled. \n\nWe believe this framework closely aligns the value delivered under \nthese awards to the shareholder experience over the same time \nperiod, as illustrated by the vesting percentages and current value \nin shares of the 2016 LTI award where 41% of the maximum num-\nber of shares were earned after the end of the performance period.\n > Refer to the \xe2\x80\x9c2016 LTI awards in the 2016-2018 performance cycle\xe2\x80\x9d in Execu-\n\ntive Board compensation for 2018 for further information. \n\n234\n\nCompensation\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nCEO compensation\nFollowing a review of Executive Board compensation at the \nbeginning of 2018, the Compensation Committee considered the \noverall Executive Board compensation design to be appropriate, \nbut recommended an adjustment, which was approved by the \nBoard, to increase the Group CEO\xe2\x80\x99s STI maximum opportunity by \nCHF 1.0 million, from 1.5 times base salary to 1.83 times base \nsalary for 2018. This adjustment is designed to acknowledge the \nstrong performance of Mr. Thiam over the course of his tenure to \ndate and the successful execution of the three-year restructuring \nprogram. It represents the first change to Mr. Thiam\xe2\x80\x99s maximum \nopportunity levels since his appointment in 2015. Aside from the \nCEO, no changes were made to the overall cap on the 2018 STI \nmaximum opportunity for the Executive Board.\n\nMr. Thiam\xe2\x80\x99s proposed total compensation for 2018 of CHF\xc2\xa012.65 \nmillion is 13% higher than it was for the prior year, before the vol-\nuntary reduction in his 2017 LTI award. This is mainly driven by \nimproved performance, the increase in his STI award maximum \nopportunity and the higher fair value for the 2018 LTI award, with \nno change to the LTI maximum opportunity.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cCompensation of the CEO and the highest paid Executive Board \nmember\xe2\x80\x9d in Executive Board compensation for 2018 for further information. \n\nBoard of Directors compensation\nNo changes were made to the Board\xe2\x80\x99s compensation framework \nfor 2018, which continues to be based on a fixed fee structure \nwith pre-defined fees for Board membership, committee mem-\nbership and chairing a committee. The fee amounts are set at \nlevels comparable with those at other leading Swiss companies \nand global financial services firms. With the exception of the \nChairman, 50% of the Group-level Board fees are paid in Group \nshares, subject to blocking restrictions for four years. In line with \nindustry practice, Board fees are not linked to the financial perfor-\nmance of the Group. Fees for specific Board leadership roles are \nreviewed periodically and adjusted as required. Base Board fees \nhave been unchanged for over 10 years. In the past few years, \nthe Chairman has voluntarily waived all or part of his chair fee. \nFor the 2018 AGM to 2019 AGM period, the Chairman\xe2\x80\x99s com-\npensation has returned to the previously approved level, in light of \nthe completion of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s restructuring program and return \nto profitability. Total board fees, including subsidiary board fees, \nfor the 2018 AGM to 2019 AGM period are within the approved \namount and 2% higher than the prior period, primarily reflecting \nan additional Board member. \n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cBoard of Directors compensation\xe2\x80\x9d for further information.\n\nAnnual review of our compensation framework \n\nDuring 2018, the Compensation Committee conducted its annual \nreview of the overall compensation framework at Credit Suisse, to \nensure that it remains fit for purpose and aligned with the objec-\ntives of our compensation strategy. In particular, the Compensa-\ntion Committee assessed the extent to which the framework (i) \naligns pay and performance, (ii) supports a performance culture \n\nbased on merit, (iii) attracts, retains, rewards and motivates \nthe talented individuals needed for our long-term success as \na client-focused and capital-efficient business, (iv) recognizes \nand rewards excellent short- and long-term performance, and \n(v) aligns with the Group\xe2\x80\x99s values. In addition, the Compensation \nCommittee reviewed market developments to assess whether \ncurrent practices remain appropriately competitive. As a result of \nthis review, it determined that the overall compensation frame-\nwork continues to be appropriate for 2019. No changes to its \nstructure are therefore proposed, aside from updating some of \nthe STI performance metrics and performance target levels for \nthe STI and LTI awards in relation to the Executive Board. \n\n2019 STI and LTI awards\nFor the 2019 STI awards, we have updated the measures to more \nappropriately reflect the Group\xe2\x80\x99s strategy after the restructuring \nperiod and the achievement of our previously communicated cost \ntarget in 2018. As such, the performance criteria for the 2019 \nSTI awards will consist of adjusted income before taxes (331\xe2\x81\x843% \nweighting), reported RoTE (331\xe2\x81\x843% weighting) and a non-financial \nassessment (331\xe2\x81\x843% weighting). RoTE is a key measure of return \ngeneration and therefore its inclusion as a performance metric \nfor the STI award, focused on the 2019 financial year, comple-\nments the RoTE measure in the LTI award which is measured as \nan average over a three-year period. Following the successful \ncompletion of our three-year cost reduction program, cost man-\nagement remains an important aspect of our strategy and will be \ncaptured by the adjusted income before taxes metric rather than \na specific cost target. This update of the performance metrics \nensures that management is focused on, and will be rewarded for, \nsuccessful delivery of our key priorities for 2019. \n\nFor the 2019 LTI awards, no changes have been made to the \ndesign or the performance metrics, since they continue to reflect \nthe longer-term strategy of the Group. However, the AGM pro-\nposal put forward for shareholder approval will be based on the \nfair value of the 2019 LTI awards at grant date, instead of the \nmaximum opportunity. The rationale for using fair value as the \nbasis for shareholder approval is to align the proposal with the \ndisclosure of Executive Board compensation in the Compensation \nReport. In addition, the fair value of the LTI awards is closer to the \nhistorical vesting of such awards than the maximum opportunity. \nThe AGM invitation and accompanying materials will continue to \ncontain the same level of information regarding the LTI award \nproposal as provided previously. \n\nFollowing the recently announced changes to the composition of \nthe Executive Board, the aggregate maximum opportunity for the \n2019 LTI awards will be CHF 57.5 million, slightly below the 2018 \nlevel, resulting from modifications to the scope of the roles for the \nincoming members. Further, the two departing Executive Board \nmembers will not be granted any entitlements they have with \nrespect to the 2019 STI and LTI awards in their roles as Execu-\ntive Board members. \n\nCompensation\n\n235\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\n2019 AGM say on pay proposals \n\nShareholder engagement\n\nAt the 2019 AGM on April 26, 2019, we plan to submit the fol-\nlowing proposals related to Executive Board and Board of Direc-\ntors compensation:\np  Maximum aggregate amount of CHF\xc2\xa031.0 million in total fixed \n\ncompensation for the Executive Board for the 2019 AGM to \n2020 AGM period \xe2\x80\x93 no change compared with the prior year\xe2\x80\x99s \nproposal approved at the 2018 AGM;\n\np  CHF\xc2\xa030.6 million total 2018 STI award to be granted to the \n\nExecutive Board \xe2\x80\x93 20% higher compared with the prior year\xe2\x80\x99s \namount approved for the 2017 STI award; \n\np  CHF\xc2\xa030.2 million total 2019 LTI award at fair value at the time \n\nof grant, with a maximum opportunity of CHF 57.5 million \xe2\x80\x93 \nCHF 1 million less than the maximum opportunity approved at \nthe 2018 AGM; and\n\np  Maximum aggregate amount of CHF\xc2\xa012.0 million in total com-\n\npensation for the Board for the 2019 AGM to 2020 AGM \nperiod \xe2\x80\x93 no change compared with the prior year\xe2\x80\x99s proposal \napproved at the 2018 AGM.\n\nAGM proposals: Executive Board compensation\nin CHF million\n\n90.2\n\n33.7\n\n25.5\n\n31.0\n\n2018\n\nLTI awards \n(fair value)\n\nSTI awards\n\nFixed  \ncompensation\n\n \n\n+2%\n\n\xe2\x80\x9310%\n\n+20%\n\n0%\n\n91.7\n\n30.2\n\n30.6\n\n31.0\n\n2019\n\nDuring 2017, we undertook several rounds of consultation to \nlisten to shareholders and receive feedback on our compensa-\ntion arrangements. Taking on board the views that we heard, \nwe announced a number of changes in our 2017 Compensation \nReport to address some key themes on compensation design for \nthe Executive Board and Board of Directors raised by share-\nholders during this process. The consultative vote on the 2017 \nCompensation Report received 81% of votes in favor at our 2018 \nAGM, a material year-on-year increase.\n\nWe are of course conscious that there remains room for improve-\nment. With this in mind, we continued to engage with key share-\nholders and external stakeholders during 2018, both to listen to \ntheir views on the changes made in 2018, and to understand \nany thoughts they had on areas of focus for the Compensation \nCommittee in future years. Going forward, shareholder engage-\nment will remain a key pillar of our annual compensation design \nprocess, with discussions on potential future changes in the third \nquarter, further consultation towards the end of the year, and \ncommunication of the compensation framework and proposals in \nthe lead up to the AGM. \n\nOn behalf of the Compensation Committee, I would like to thank \nyou for your support and feedback, which we will continue to seek \nas we review and refine our compensation practices to ensure \nthat they remain fully compliant with all regulatory requirements \nand aligned with the interests of our shareholders.\n\nKai S.

For 2018, Group and divisional results are adjusted to exclude items such as goodwill impairment, real estate transactions, business sales, restructuring expenses and \nmajor litigation provisions. Regulatory capital for compensation purposes was defined for each division as the higher of 10% of average divisional Basel III risk-weighted assets and 3.5% \nof average divisional leverage exposure. This measure of economic contribution considers the profitability of the divisions and the Group and the capital utilized to achieve this profitability. \n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cDetermination of variable incentive compensation pools\xe2\x80\x9d in Group compensation \xe2\x80\x93 Compensation framework for further information.\n\nGroup employees\xe2\x80\x99 compensation framework for 2018: key elements\nThe overall structure and design remains the same as the prior year. \n\nFeatures\n\nBase  \nSalary\n\nd\ne\nx\ni\n\nF\n\nPension  \nand\tBenefits\t\n\nCash  \nAward\n\nShare \nAwards\n\nl\n\ne\nb\na\n\ni\nr\na\nV\n\n Performance \nShare \nAwards\n\nContingent \nCapital \nAwards \n(CCA)\n\nVesting (year)\n\n2018\n\n2019\n\n2020\n\n2021\n\n2022\n\nDesign\n\np Based on skills, qualifications, relevant experience, responsibilities and \n\np Role-based allowances apply to certain Material Risk Takers and \n\nexternal market factors\n\n Controllers (MRTC)\n\np Pension and benefits consistent with local market practice\np Includes country-specific pension schemes, certain allowances, \n\n subsidizations and insurances\n\np Employees with total compensation below CHF/USD 250,000 receive \ntheir full amount of variable compensation in the form of an immediate \ncash award \n\n1\xe2\x81\x843\n\n1\xe2\x81\x843\n\n1\xe2\x81\x843\n\n1\xe2\x81\x843\n\n1\xe2\x81\x843\n\n1\xe2\x81\x843\n\n \n\n \n\nD\nS\nU\n/\nF\nH\nC\n\n \nf\no\n \nn\no\ni\nt\na\ns\nn\ne\np\nm\no\nc\n \nl\na\nt\no\nt\n \nr\no\nF\n\n:\nr\ne\nh\ng\nh\n \nr\no\n \n\ni\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n5\n2\n\n,\n\np Deferred share awards with no additional performance conditions\n\np Managing Directors (MD) and MRTC receive deferred share awards \nwith performance conditions as part of their deferred compensation\n\np MD and Directors receive loss-absorbing contingent capital awards\np At settlement, contingent capital instrument or cash payment based \n\non the fair value of the CCA\n\np Prior to settlement, conditional right to receive semi-annual cash \n\n payments of interest equivalents\n\nNote: Individuals in certain jurisdictions may be subject to conditions other than those outlined above in order to comply with local legal or regulatory requirements.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cGroup compensation\xe2\x80\x9d for further information.\n\n238\n\nCompensation\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nCompensation governance\nThe Compensation Committee\n\nThe Compensation Committee is the supervisory and governing \nbody for compensation policies, practices and plans.

Therefore, employees working in the \ncorporate functions, including those performing control functions, \nare remunerated independently from the performance of the busi-\nnesses they oversee and support. As with the business divisions, \nthe assessment of the corporate functions takes into account \nrisk, control, compliance and ethical considerations and relative \nperformance compared to peers, as well as the market and regu-\nlatory environment.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cDetermination of the variable incentive compensation pools\xe2\x80\x9d in Group \n\ncompensation for further information.\n\nPerformance criteria and target setting \nAt the beginning of the year, as part of the annual compensation \nreview, the Compensation Committee defines the performance \ncriteria and performance targets that will be applied to deter-\nmine the Executive Board\xe2\x80\x99s variable incentive compensation. For \nthe STI awards, the performance criteria and performance levels \nare set on an annual basis, and are designed to reward progress \ntowards the achievement of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s annual objectives in the \nfinancial and strategic plan. For the LTI awards, the performance \ncriteria and performance levels are set for a prospective three-\nyear period, designed to reward achievement of the longer term \nbusiness plan and the enhancement of shareholder returns. In \nsetting the threshold, target and maximum performance levels, \nthe Compensation Committee takes into account the Group\xe2\x80\x99s \nambitious financial plan, prior-year performance, analyst expecta-\ntions and any publicly stated targets, in order to set performance \nlevels which are challenging and motivating for the Executive \nBoard. The performance criteria and performance levels are pre-\nsented to the Board for approval before implementation. \n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nAssessment\tof\tperformance\tagainst\tfinancial\tcriteria\t\nThe financial criteria and corresponding 2018 outcomes are \nshown in the following table and can be summarized as follows:\np  Adjusted income before taxes of CHF 4.2 billion was up 52% \n\ncompared with the prior year, and between the target and \nmaximum performance levels; and \n\np  Adjusted operating cost base of CHF 16.2 billion at average \n2017 foreign exchange rates (as defined further in footnote \n1 of the table below), surpassing the maximum performance \nlevel which had been set at CHF 16.9 billion.\n\nExecutive Board compensation \nfor 2018\nCompensation outcomes for 2018\n\n2018 STI awards\nThe 2018 STI awards were designed to reward the achieve-\nment of annual objectives based on performance in 2018. The \nSTI award payout amount is determined based on pre-defined \nfinancial criteria and performance levels which are linked to our \nstrategic plan, as well as non-financial criteria related to topics \nsuch as delivery of strategic initiatives, leadership and culture and \nrisk and compliance.

The Executive Board also continued \n\nto drive the emphasis on conduct and ethics within their respec-\ntive divisions and functions, as well as promote the recruitment, \ndevelopment and retention of talent through various Group-wide \ninitiatives. As such, the Compensation Committee determined \nthat, as a group, the Executive Board had achieved 91% of the \nmaximum opportunity with respect to the non-financial assess-\nment.

This adjustment took into account the strong per-\nformance of Mr. Thiam over the course of his tenure to date, and \nrepresents the first change to Mr. Thiam\xe2\x80\x99s maximum opportunity \nlevels since 2015. \n\nThe compensation awarded to the CEO and highest paid Execu-\ntive Board member, Tidjane Thiam, comprised of CHF\xc2\xa03.00 \nmillion base salary, which remained unchanged compared with \n\nthe prior year, a 2018 STI award of CHF\xc2\xa04.94 million represent-\ning 90% of the maximum opportunity and a 2018 LTI award \nwith a maximum opportunity of CHF\xc2\xa07.50 million and a fair value \nof CHF\xc2\xa04.36 million at the time of grant.

In particular, the Com-\npensation Committee noted his leadership in the restructuring \nof the Group, creating a client-focused and compliant culture \n\nNon-financial\tassessment\tfor\tthe\tCEO\n\nand steering the Group towards a significant turnaround in per-\nformance. The Compensation Committee determined that Mr. \nThiam had achieved the maximum performance level and his key \nachievements against the non-financial metrics are summarized \nbelow.\n\nStrategic Repositioning\np  Mr. Thiam has led the rebalancing of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s activities, \nincluding the right-sizing of the Global Markets division and \nthe shift of capital towards the higher growth and less vola-\ntile Wealth Management-related and Investment Banking & \nCapital Markets businesses\n\np  He has continued to oversee the maintenance of the \n\nGroup\xe2\x80\x99s strong capital position, and has supervised the suc-\ncessful closure of the Strategic Resolution Unit\n\np  Since his appointment to the role of CEO, the female Man-\n\naging Director promotion ratio has increased by 47%\n\nRisk and Regulatory\np  Mr. Thiam has continued to strengthen the relationships with \n\nthe Group\xe2\x80\x99s key regulators \n\np  Under his leadership, there have been steady reductions in \nthe number of adverse risk, regulatory and sustainability risk \nevents\n\nClient Focus/Quality of Business/Innovation\np  Mr. Thiam has continued to drive a culture of client focus, \nreflected by high client satisfaction results and positive net \nnew assets in each quarter of 2018 \n\nConduct and Ethics \np  Mr. Thiam has continued to strengthen the global conduct \nand ethics culture through a formalized conduct and ethics \nframework and Group-wide training programs\n\np  He has overseen the growth of the investment banking busi-\n\np  He has overseen the significant upgrade of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s \n\nnesses in key segments, with a top five market position in \nInitial Public Offerings and top two in Leveraged Finance \n(Dealogic)\n\np  Under his leadership, the Impact Advisory and Finance \n(IAF) department, which aims to facilitate initiatives for \nclients which have a positive economic and social impact, \nhas reached USD 7.1 billion of assets under administration \ninvested according to sustainability criteria and surpassed \nUSD 1 billion in Asia in 2018\n\np  He has received industry recognition for his leadership and \nfocus on excellence in client service, named as Banker of \nthe Year 2018 by Euromoney\n\nTalent management \np  Mr. Thiam has been instrumental in driving several people \n\ndevelopment and diversity initiatives\n\ncompliance and control framework, with greater investment \nin compliance talent, implementation of new compliance \ntools such as Single Client View and trader/relationship \nmanager surveillance tools, as well as more than 10,000 \ncontrol issues and improvements closed across all Group-\nwide risks since his appointment \n\np  He has led by example in terms of personal commitment to \n\nthe Group\xe2\x80\x99s conduct and ethics standards\n\nTeamwork and Leadership\np  Mr. Thiam has fostered a spirit of teamwork and collabora-\ntion amongst the Executive Board members, which has fil-\ntered throughout the organization \n\np  He has continued to steer an integrated approach between \n\nthe wealth management and investment banking busi-\nnesses, as evidenced by the strong ITS business model \n\n244\n\nCompensation\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nUtilization of Executive Board compensation \napproved at the 2018 AGM\n\nAt the 2018 AGM, shareholders approved a maximum aggre-\ngate amount of fixed compensation to be paid to members of the \nExecutive Board for the period from the 2018 AGM to the 2019 \nAGM of CHF\xc2\xa031.0 million. By the time of the 2019 AGM, a total \nof approximately CHF\xc2\xa029.3 million will have been paid to Execu-\ntive Board members with respect to fixed compensation. Fixed \ncompensation includes base salaries, role-based allowances, divi-\ndend equivalents, pension and other benefits.\n\nAt the 2018 AGM, shareholders also approved an aggregate \nmaximum amount of LTI compensation to be granted to mem-\nbers of the Executive Board for the 2018 financial year with a \nmaximum amount of CHF\xc2\xa058.5 million, which was subsequently \nawarded to the Executive Board members. The amount of the \n2018 LTI award earned by each of the Executive Board members \ncan only be determined after the completion of the three-year \nperformance period.\n\nIn line with the Compensation Ordinance and as specified in the \nAoA, if new members join the Executive Board or members of the \nExecutive Board are promoted during a period for which compen-\nsation has already been approved by shareholders, a further 30% \nof the aggregate amounts already approved may be used for the \ncompensation of such members. No such additional amount was \nrequired in 2018. \n\nSupplementary information \n\nCash settlement of share awards\nThe Executive Board members are permitted to elect, subject \nto minimum shareholding requirements, at a predefined date in \nadvance of settlement, to receive their vested share-based awards \nin the form of shares, cash or 50% in the form of shares and 50% \nin cash, in each case based on the Group share price at the time \nof settlement. An election to receive cash is subject to reversal if \nat the time of settlement the Group share price is less than 75% \nof the share price at the time of election. The timing and pricing of \nsettlement will be the same as under the previous award plan and \nas under the plans of the non-Executive Board population. \n\nContract lengths, termination and change in control \nprovisions \nAll members of the Executive Board have employment contracts \nwith the Group which are valid until terminated. The notice period \nfor termination of employment by either the Group or the respec-\ntive Executive Board member is six months. Executive Board \nmembers may be held to a non-compete period of up to one \nyear and may be compensated for this period of time by mutual \nagreement. In the event of termination, there are no contractual \n\nprovisions that allow for the payment of severance awards to \nExecutive Board members beyond the regular compensation \nawarded during the notice period. Pre-defined conditions for all \nemployees, including Executive Board members, apply for the \npayment of outstanding deferred compensation awards, depend-\ning on whether the termination of employment was voluntary, \ninvoluntary or the result of a change in control. There are no other \ncontracts, agreements or arrangements with the members of the \nExecutive Board that provide for other types of payments or ben-\nefits in connection with termination of employment that are not \ngenerally available to other employees of the Group.\n\nIn the case of a change in control, the treatment of outstanding \nawards for all employees, including Executive Board members, \nwill be determined by the Board upon recommendation of the \nCompensation Committee with the aim of maximizing shareholder \nvalue, subject to circumstances and prevailing market conditions. \nThere are no provisions in the employment contracts of Executive \nBoard members or any other pre-determined arrangements that \nrequire the payment of any type of extraordinary benefits, includ-\ning special severance awards or transaction premia, in the case of \na change in control.\n\nFormer Executive Board members (audited)\nDuring 2018, no former Executive Board member received any \ncompensation for services they continued to perform after they \nstepped down from the Executive Board, compared with CHF \n1.4 million in 2017. Further, no payments were made to former \nExecutive Board members pursuant to non-compete arrange-\nments. Some former members of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s most senior execu-\ntive body who no longer provide services to the Group are still \neligible to receive office infrastructure and secretarial support. \nThese services are based on existing resources and are not used \non a regular basis. \n\nOther outstanding awards \nAs of December 31, 2018, the outstanding cash-based deferred \ncompensation awards granted to certain Executive Board mem-\nbers in prior years comprised of the Capital Opportunity Facility \n(COF), CCA, LTI plan (2013) and deferred STI cash awards. The \ncumulative value of such cash-based awards at their grant dates \nwas CHF\xc2\xa028.9 million compared with CHF\xc2\xa029.3 million as of \nDecember 31, 2018. These amounts also include the cash value \nof dividend equivalents related to unvested share awards at their \nrespective grant dates and at December 31, 2018.\n\nMinimum shareholding requirements \nAs of December 31, 2018, the CEO and all Executive Board \nmembers fulfilled the minimum shareholding requirements of \n500,000 shares and 300,000 shares, respectively, as measured \nagainst the number of shares owned plus the number of unvested \nawards calculated on the basis of maximum opportunity. \n\nCompensation\n\n245\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nExecutive Board holdings and values of deferred share-based awards by individual \nNumber of   \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \nowned shares and   \n\xc2\xa0 \nunvested awards   \nend of\xc2\xa0 \n(at maximum opportunity)   \n\n   \nNumber of   \nunvested awards   \n(at maximum opportunity)   2 \n\n   \n   \nNumber of   \nowned shares   1 \n\nValue (CHF) of   \nunvested awards   \nat grant date   \n(at maximum opportunity)   \n\nValue (CHF) of \nunvested awards  \nat year end  \n(at fair value)   3\n\n2018\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \n \nTidjane Thiam\xc2\xa0 \nJames L.

Such loans are made \non the same terms available to employees under the Group\xe2\x80\x99s \nemployee benefit plans. Pursuant to the AoA, each Executive \nBoard member may be granted individual credit facilities or loans \nup to a maximum of CHF\xc2\xa020 million. As of December 31, 2018, \n2017 and 2016, outstanding loans to Executive Board members \namounted to CHF\xc2\xa033 million, CHF\xc2\xa026 million and CHF\xc2\xa025 million, \nrespectively. The number of individuals with outstanding loans at \nthe beginning and the end of 2018 was 8 and 9, respectively, and \nthe highest loan outstanding was CHF\xc2\xa06 million to Mr. Sitohang.\n\nAll mortgage loans to Executive Board members are granted either \nwith variable or fixed interest rates over a certain period. Typically, \nmortgages are granted for periods of up to ten years. Interest rates \n\napplied are based on refinancing costs plus a margin, and interest \nrates and other terms are consistent with those applicable to other \nemployees. Loans against securities are granted at interest rates \nand on terms applicable to such loans granted to other employees. \nThe same credit approval and risk assessment procedures apply \nto Executive Board members as for other employees. Unless oth-\nerwise noted, all loans to Executive Board members were made \nin the ordinary course of business and substantially on the same \nterms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing \nat the time for comparable transactions with other persons and in \nconsideration of the terms which apply to all Group employees. \nThese loans did not involve more than the normal risk of collectabil-\nity or present other unfavorable features.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cBanking relationships with Board and Executive Board members and \nrelated party transactions\xe2\x80\x9d in IV \xe2\x80\x93 Corporate Governance \xe2\x80\x93 Additional informa-\ntion for further information.\n\nCompensation\n\n247\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\n2016 LTI awards in the 2016-2018 performance cycle\n\nAs disclosed in the 2015 Compensation Report, we introduced a \nthree-year performance-based LTI award in 2016 with a combination \nof Group and division-specific financial metrics, as well as an RTSR \ncomponent (40% weighting). The initial number of shares granted \nwas calculated by dividing the LTI maximum opportunity by the \nvolume-weighted average share price for the 10 trading days follow-\ning the release of the 2015 annual results, consistent with all other \nshare awards granted to Group employees. Reflecting the share \nprice under-performance over the 2016-2018 performance mea-\nsurement period, the RTSR component resulted in zero payout, and \ntaking into consideration the performance against the financial crite-\nria, the number of shares earned based on performance conditions \n\nrepresents 41% of the maximum opportunity for the Executive \nBoard, in aggregate. For the CEO, the number of shares earned \nbased on performance conditions over the three-year period (payout \nlevel) represents 36% of his maximum opportunity, and for the divi-\nsional and function heads, the payout levels range from 36% to 62% \nof the individual maximum opportunities. The impact of share price \nmovements since the grant date is illustrated in the diagram below, \nwith the value of the 2016 LTI award based on the share price at the \nend of 2018 being 25% of the maximum opportunity. The LTI award \nvests in three equal tranches on the third, fourth and fifth anniversa-\nries of the grant date. The final value of the awards at delivery may \ndiffer from the value at the end of 2018 due to subsequent share \nprice movements. \n\nVesting of 2016 LTI awards\n\nThe number of shares initially granted was determined by dividing the LTI award maximum opportunity by the share \nprice at the time of grant.\n\nThe percentage of shares earned is based on the achievement of performance targets over the three-year perfor-\nmance period.\n\nShares vest in three equal tranches on the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the grant date. Based on the share \nprice at the end of 2018, the value of these shares was 25% of the 2016 LTI maximum  opportunity.\n\n100%\nLTI award maximum opportunity\n\n41%\nAchievement of performance targets\n\n25%\nValue of earned shares based on share \nprice as of 31 December 2018\n\n2016 LTI awards: performance against targets\n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \nPerformance criteria\xc2\xa0 \n\nGroup metrics (applicable to all Executive Board members) \n \n \n \n \n \nRelative Total Shareholder Return (RTSR)\xc2\xa02 \nLook-through CET1 ratio (%)\xc2\xa0 \nCET1 leverage ratio (%)\xc2\xa0 \nAdjusted operating cost base (CHF billion)\xc2\xa0 \n\nTarget   \nperformance level   \n   \n   \n\n   \nWeighting   1 \n   \n   \n\n2018   \nresult   \n   \n   \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\nPayout level\n(% of maximum opportunity)\n\n \n\n0% \n\nThreshold \n\n25% \n\nTarget \n80% \n\nMaximum\n\n100%\n\n   \n13.0%   \n3.5%   \n18.0   \n\n40%    Ranked 17th   \n12.7%   3 \n4.1%   \n16.5   4 \n\n13.3%   \n13.3%   \n13.3%   \n\n \n\np \n              p \n \n \n\n \n \n\n \nOperating free capital generation (applicable to CEO and Functional heads) \n \n \n \n \nOperating free capital generation (CHF billion)\xc2\xa05 \n\n6.0   \n\n20.0%   \n\n2.0   \n\np \n\n \n\n \nDivisional metrics (applicable to Divisional heads) \n \n \n \n \nVarious division-specific metrics (average)\xc2\xa0 \n\n   \n\n20.0%   \n\n   \n\n \n\n    p \n\n1 Due to the nature of the role, the weighting of the Group and divisional metrics is different for the Executive Board member who is categorized as UK PRA Code Staff.\n2 RTSR is measured over the three-year performance period 2016-2018.\n3 The look-through CET1 ratio excludes CHF 2.2 billion of additional risk-weighted assets arising from Basel III rule changes effective in 2018 relating to banking book securitizations that \n\nwere not yet in place when the 2016 target was set.\n\n4 Adjusted results are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items included in our reported results.

The fee amounts for the 2018 AGM to 2019 AGM \nBoard period are shown in the table below, and are consistent \nwith the prior year, except that the Risk Committee Chair fee has \nbeen reduced to CHF 400,000 (from CHF 420,000) as previ-\nously disclosed. \n\nMembership fees: 2018 AGM \xe2\x80\x93 2019 AGM \n\xc2\xa0 \nRole\xc2\xa0 \n\nBase  \nfees  \n\nChair   \nfees   1 \n\nCommittee \nfees \n\n \n\n \n\nCHF\xc2\xa0 \nChairman\xc2\xa0 \nBoard member\xc2\xa02 \nAudit Committee (AC)\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x93\nCompensation Committee (CC)\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x93\nGovernance and \xc2\xa0 \nNominations Committee (GNC)\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x93\nRisk Committee (RC)\xc2\xa0 \xe2\x80\x93\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n3,000,000  \n250,000  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n1,500,000   \n\xe2\x80\x93   \n480,000   \n300,000   \nNo additional   \nfee   \n400,000   \n\n\xe2\x80\x93 \n\xe2\x80\x93 \n150,000 \n100,000 \n \n50,000 \n100,000 \n\n1 Committee chairs do not receive committee fees in addition to their chair fees.\n2 The Vice-Chair and Lead Independent Director does not receive additional compensation \n\nfor these roles.\n\nIt is the intention of the Board to leave these fee amounts \nunchanged for the next Board compensation period, except that \na new committee fee of CHF 75,000 will be introduced for mem-\nbership of the newly established Conduct and Financial Crime \nControl Committee, which will be paid for the first time for the \nperiod from the 2019 AGM to the 2020 AGM.\n\nCompensation of the Chairman\nThe Chairman\xe2\x80\x99s role is a full-time appointment. He is paid an \nannual base board fee of CHF\xc2\xa03.0 million in cash (divided into 12 \nmonthly payments) plus a chair fee of CHF\xc2\xa01.5 million in Group \nshares delivered in one installment at the end of the current board \nperiod. In the past few years, the Chairman has voluntarily waived \nall or part of his chair fee. For the 2018 AGM to 2019 AGM \nperiod, the Chairman\xe2\x80\x99s compensation has returned to the previ-\nously approved level, in light of the successful completion of the \nGroup\xe2\x80\x99s restructuring program. The Chairman may also receive \nbenefits from and make contributions to the Group pension fund \nin line with local market practice for the Group. The total com-\npensation paid to the Chairman reflects his full-time status and \nactive role in shaping the Group\xe2\x80\x99s strategy, governing the Group\xe2\x80\x99s \naffairs, engaging and maintaining a close working relationship \n\nwith the CEO and senior management, and providing counsel \nand support, where appropriate. The Chairman coordinates the \nBoard\xe2\x80\x99s activities, works with the committee chairs to coordinate \nthe tasks of the committees and ensures that Board members \nare provided with sufficient information to perform their duties. \nThe Chairman drives the Board agenda on key topics such as the \nstrategic development of the Group, corporate culture, succes-\nsion planning and the structure and organization of the Group. \nThe Chairman also steers the agenda on compensation and com-\npensation structure, including the performance evaluation and \ncompensation of the CEO and the Executive Board. He chairs \nthe Board, the Governance and Nominations Committee and the \nshareholder meetings and takes an active role in representing the \nGroup to regulators and supervisors, key shareholders, investors, \nand other external stakeholders. Moreover, he is a member of \nseveral Swiss and international industry associations on behalf of \nthe Group, including the Swiss Bankers Association, the Swiss \nFinance Council, the Institute of International Finance and the \nEuropean Banking Group.\n\nCompensation of the committee chairs\nThe committee chair fees are fixed in advance and are not linked \nto the Group\xe2\x80\x99s financial performance. The chair fees are paid \n50% in cash and 50% in Group shares in one installment at the \nend of the current board period. In addition to the greater time \ncommitment required to prepare and lead the committee work, \nthe chair fees reflect the engagement of the three committee \nchairs throughout the year with regulators, shareholders, the busi-\nness divisions and corporate functions and other stakeholders. \nRegulatory developments in the banking industry in recent years \nhave put increasing demands on the Risk and Audit Committee \nChairs, in particular, increasing the frequency of interaction with \nthe Group\xe2\x80\x99s main regulators on internal control, risk, capital and \nother matters under the supervision of these committees. Simi-\nlarly, the greater focus of shareholders and regulators on com-\npensation has resulted in an increased number of engagements \nbetween the Compensation Committee Chair and key sharehold-\ners and shareholder proxy advisers, as well as with regulators. \nThe Compensation Committee held 9 meetings and calls during \n2018. The Audit Committee Chair fee also considers the greater \nnumber of meetings required of the Audit Committee for the \nreview and approval of the quarterly financial results and related \nfilings and the Audit Committee Chair\xe2\x80\x99s supervisory role over the \nInternal Audit function. The Audit Committee held 18 meetings \nand calls during 2018. The Risk Committee Chair fee consid-\ners the regular interaction required between the Risk Committee \nChair and the Group chief risk officer and other senior manag-\ners in the risk management function, as well as the oversight role \nover the Credit Risk Review function, which reports directly to the \nRisk Committee Chair. The Risk Committee held 6 meetings dur-\ning 2018, and in addition, the Risk Committee Chair held numer-\nous meetings with regulators and other stakeholders.\n > Refer to the table \xe2\x80\x9cMembers of the Board and Board committees\xe2\x80\x9d in IV \xe2\x80\x93 Cor-\n\nporate Governance \xe2\x80\x93 Board of Directors for further information.\n\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cCredit risk governance\xe2\x80\x9d in III \xe2\x80\x93 Treasury, Risk, Balance sheet and Off-\nbalance sheet \xe2\x80\x93 Risk management \xe2\x80\x93 Risk coverage and management \xe2\x80\x93 Credit \nrisk for further information on the Credit Risk Review function.\n\nCompensation\n\n251\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nUtilization of Board compensation approved at \nthe 2018 AGM\n\nAt the 2018 AGM, shareholders approved an aggregate amount \nof compensation to be paid to members of the Board for the \nperiod from the 2018 AGM to the 2019 AGM of CHF\xc2\xa012.0 mil-\nlion. Of this amount, a total of CHF\xc2\xa011.7 million will have been \npaid to Board members by the time of the 2019 AGM, of which \n\nCHF\xc2\xa010.4 million related to fees for Group Board member-\nships and CHF\xc2\xa01.3 million related to fees paid to certain Board \nmembers for subsidiary board membership. Total Group Board \ncompensation is 6% higher compared with the prior period, and \naggregate Board and subsidiary board compensation for Board \nmembers is 2% higher, primarily reflecting an additional Board \nmember. \n\nBoard compensation from the 2018 AGM to the 2019 AGM (audited) \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\n   \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \nGNC\xc2\xa0  AC\xc2\xa0  CC\xc2\xa0  RC\xc2\xa0 \n\n   \n   \nBase board    Committee   \nfee   \n\n   \n   \nChair   \nfee   \n\n   \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\n   \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\nfee   \n\n \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\n   \n   \n\n       \n\n   \n\n   \n\n \n\n   \nPension   \nand other   \nbenefits   \n\n   \n\n   \n   \n   \nTotal   \n\nGroup   \nOf which   \nawarded   \nin Group   \nshares   1 \n\n   \n\n \n\nSubsidiaries   \nTotal, \n   \n   \nPension   \nincluding \n   \nand other    subsidiary \nSubsidiary   \nboard fee   2 \nbenefits   \nboards   3\n\nCHF\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUrs Rohner, Chairman\xc2\xa04  C\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \nIris Bohnet\xc2\xa0 \nAndreas Gottschling\xc2\xa0 M\n\xc2\xa0  M\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0  M\xc2\xa0 \nAlexander Gut\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \nMichael Klein\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0  M\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \nAndreas N.

The total compensation of the Chairman includes benefits for the period from the \n2017 AGM to the 2018 AGM of CHF 216,823, including pension and health insurance benefits.\n\n4 Mr. Zeller was eligible for pension and health insurance benefits in connection with his role as board member and chairman of the board of directors of the subsidiary Credit Suisse \n\n(Schweiz) AG, but not for his role as a member of the Group Board.\n\nCompensation of Board members serving on \nsubsidiary boards\n\nA number of Board members also serve as members on the \nboards of Group subsidiary companies. This practice is consistent \nwith the Group\xe2\x80\x99s legal entity governance principles, which aim to \nfoster a close alignment of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s governance practices and \nthose of its significant subsidiary companies.\n > Refer to the \xe2\x80\x9cGovernance of Group subsidiaries\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cBiographies of the Board \n\nmembers\xe2\x80\x9d in IV \xe2\x80\x93 Corporate Governance \xe2\x80\x93 Board of Directors for further \ninformation.\n\nWith the exception of the Chairman, Board members may receive \nseparate fees for serving on subsidiary boards, in addition to their \nBoard fees, which are paid in cash. These fees are approved by \nthe respective subsidiary boards and are subject to ratification \nby the Board. All subsidiary board fees are included in the total \namount of compensation of the members of the Board proposed \nfor approval by shareholders at the AGM. The Chairman does \nnot receive separate fees for board memberships in other Group \ncompanies, as this is considered to be included as part of the \nChairman\xe2\x80\x99s compensation. \n\nThe Board members newly appointed to serve on subsid-\niary boards receive a flat subsidiary board membership fee of \nCHF\xc2\xa0100,000 (or higher amounts if a Board member serves as \nthe chair of the subsidiary board or a committee). This amount \nis generally less than that received by other external subsidiary \nboard members, given that Board members are already familiar \nwith the Group\xe2\x80\x99s entities and activities. Serving on a subsidiary \nboard is nevertheless a significant additional commitment for \nthese Board members, reflected, for example, in the number of \nsubsidiary board meetings held throughout the year as shown in \nthe following table. \n\nNumber of subsidiary board meetings\n\xc2\xa0 \n\nBoard   Committee   1 \n\n \n\n \n\nSubsidiary\xc2\xa0 \nCredit Suisse (Schweiz) AG\xc2\xa0 \nCredit Suisse International (CSI) / \xc2\xa0 \nCredit Suisse Securities (Europe) Ltd.

Salary levels are based on \nthe skills, qualifications and relevant experience of the individ-\nual, the responsibilities required by the role and external market \nfactors.\n\nRole-based allowances\nRole-based allowances are a component of fixed compensation \nawarded to certain employees identified as Prudential Regulation \nAuthority (PRA) Code Staff under UK regulatory requirements \nor material risk-takers under other EU regulatory requirements. \nThese role-based allowances are determined based on the role \nand organizational responsibility of the individuals. Role-based \nallowances are deemed to be fixed compensation for the pur-\nposes of calculating the cap of variable incentive compensation as \nrequired by the Capital Requirements Directive IV (CRD IV) and \nCapital Requirements Regulation (CRR). Role-based allowances \nfor 2018 were paid entirely in cash on a non-deferred basis.\n\nVariable incentive compensation \nFor 2018, variable incentive compensation was paid in cash \nunless the total compensation awarded to an employee for 2018 \nwas greater than or equal to CHF\xc2\xa0250,000 or the local currency \nequivalent or USD\xc2\xa0250,000 for employees whose total compen-\nsation is denominated in US dollars. In these cases a portion was \npaid in cash and the balance was deferred, vesting at a later date.\n\nGenerally, employees receive the cash portion of their variable \nincentive compensation at a regular payroll settlement date close \nto the grant date. To comply with CRD IV requirements, employ-\nees who hold material risk-taker roles in respect of certain Group \nsubsidiaries in the EU receive shares for 50% of the non-deferred \nportion of variable incentive compensation that would have been \npaid to them as cash. These shares are vested at the time of \ngrant but remain blocked, that is, subject to transfer restrictions, \nfor a period of 12 months. \n\nTo enable closer alignment with market practice and local varia-\ntions, two deferral tables have been applied since 2015: one for \nthe Americas and another for the rest of the world. For 2018, the \ndeferral rates ranged from 17.5% to 80% of variable incentive \ncompensation for employees located in the Americas, and 17.5% \nto 85% of variable incentive compensation for employees located \nelsewhere. The amount of variable incentive compensation paid in \ncash for 2018 was capped at CHF\xc2\xa02 million or the local currency \nequivalent (or USD 2 million for employees whose total compen-\nsation is denominated in US dollars) per employee.\n\nCompensation components by employee category \n\nFixed \n\ncompensation\n\nBase  \nsalary\n\nTotal compensation\n\nVariable compensation\n\nDeferred compensation1\n\nCash\n\nShare \nawards\n\nPerformance \nshare awards\n\nContingent \n\nCapital Awards\n\n20%\n\n20%\n\n50%\n\n50%\n\n30%\n\n80%\n\n50%\n\n100%\n\nEmployee category\n\nManaging directors and directors who are MRTC\n\nOther directors\n\nOther MRTC\n\nOther employees with total compen sation  \nof CHF/USD 250,000 or higher\n\nEmployees with total compensation  \nbelow CHF/USD 250,000\n\n1 Deferred compensation is applicable to employees with total compensation of CHF/USD 250,000 or higher.\n\nCompensation\n\n255\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nDeferred compensation: key features \n\nAward\n\nShare  \nawards\n\nDelivery1\n\nVesting period1\n\nPerformance conditions\n\np One registered share per award\np Dividend equivalents (payable \n\nupon delivery) \n\np 3 years (ratable vesting)\np 5 years (ratable vesting) for risk \n\nmanagers2\n\np 7 years (ratable vesting over \n\nfive years, starting on the third \nanniversary) for senior managers3\n\np No additional performance conditions \n\nPerformance \nshare awards\n\np One registered share per award\np Dividend equivalents (payable \n\nupon delivery)\n\np 3 years (ratable vesting)\np 5 years (ratable vesting) for risk \n\nmanagers2\n\np 7 years (ratable vesting over \n\nfive years, starting on the third \nanniversary) for senior managers3\n\nContingent \nCapital Awards \n(CCA)\n\np At settlement, contingent capital \n\ninstrument or cash payment based \non the fair value of the CCA\n\np 3 years (cliff vesting)\np 5 years (cliff vesting) for risk \n\np Prior to settlement, conditional \n\np 7 years (cliff vesting) for senior \n\nmanagers2\n\nmanagers3 \n\nright to receive semi-annual cash \npayments of interest equivalents \n\np Timing and form of distribution \n\nupon settlement is subject to \napproval by FINMA \n\np Performance conditions apply to full balance of \n\noutstanding awards\n\np Negative adjustment applies in event of divisional loss4 \n\nby the division in which the employee worked as of \nDecember 31, 2018, or a negative return on equity \n(RoE) of the Group, whichever results in a larger \nadjustment \n\np For employees in the corporate functions and the \nStrategic Resolution Unit, the negative adjustment \nonly applies in the event of a negative RoE of the \nGroup \n\nPrior to settlement, the principal amount would be \n written down to zero and forfeited if:\np The Group\xe2\x80\x99s reported CET1 ratio falls below 7%; or \np FINMA determines that cancellation of the CCA \n\nand other similar contingent capital instruments is \nnecessary, or that the Group requires public sector \ncapital support, in either case to prevent it from \nbecoming insolvent or otherwise failing\n\n1 Individuals in certain jurisdictions may be subject to conditions other than those outlined here in order to comply with local legal or regulatory requirements.\n2 Risk managers are a subset of the UK PRA Code Staff population, defined as individuals identified as having responsibility for managing or supervising risk-taking or significant risk \n\nfunctions for the Group\xe2\x80\x99s UK entities. \n\n3 Senior managers are a subset of the UK PRA Code Staff population, defined as individuals who retain the greatest influence over the strategic direction of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s UK business, and \n\nwho also perform one or more of the PRA and UK Financial Conduct Authority\xe2\x80\x99s designated senior management functions and \xe2\x80\x9cprescribed responsibilities\xe2\x80\x9d for the relevant UK entities. \n\n4 Refer to table \xe2\x80\x9cPotential downward adjustments of performance share awards\xe2\x80\x9d. \n \n\nPotential downward adjustments of performance share \nawards \nAs described in the above table, performance share awards may \nbe subject to negative adjustments in the event of a divisional \nloss.

The primary driver of the pool amounts is the \nGroup\xe2\x80\x99s financial performance in terms of economic contribu-\ntion, measured as adjusted income before taxes excluding vari-\nable incentive compensation expenses, after deducting a capital \nusage charge. Non-financial factors are also considered in the \ndetermination of the pool amounts, including progress on the \nachievement of strategic objectives, market position and trend, \nrisk-related issues, relative performance compared to peers, and \nany extraordinary events, such as, but not limited to, company \nreorganizations, major legacy settlements or any other exceptional \ncircumstances. In this regard, the Compensation Committee can \napply discretion to make positive and negative adjustments to the \nvariable incentive compensation pools. \n\n256\n\nCompensation\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nDetermination of variable incentive compensation pools\n\nGovernance\n\np Compensation \n\nCommittee \nreview \n\np Board  \napproval\n\np Control functions provide feedback which may result in adjustments to divisional \n\npools or individual allocations\n\np Conduct and Ethics Boards (or the Compensation Committee in the case of MD) \n\napply malus to deferred compensation and/or variable compensation based on \ndisciplinary review in cases of misconduct\n\nProcess\n\nFactors\n\nQuarterly \naccruals\n\nFinal Group \npool\n\nDivisional and \nCorporate \nFunction pools\n\nAllocation to \nbusiness areas\n\nAllocation to \nline managers\n\nAllocation to \nemployees\n\np Economic contribution\np Risk, control, compliance, conduct \n\nand ethics\n\np Relative performance vs peers\np Market positioning\np Regulatory environment\n\np Capital usage\np Risk \n\np Individual \n\nand business \nperformance\n\nThe variable incentive compensation pools are determined on an \nannual basis, with accruals made on a quarterly basis through-\nout the year. The Compensation Committee regularly reviews the \naccruals and related financial information and applies adjustments \nin exceptional circumstances to ensure that the overall size of the \npools is consistent with the Group\xe2\x80\x99s compensation objectives. \nThe total amount of the pool for the corporate functions is not \nlinked to the performance of the particular divisions that employ-\nees of the corporate functions support or oversee, but takes into \naccount the Group-wide financial performance, measured in the \nform of Group economic contribution and non-financial factors. \nTherefore, employees working in the corporate functions, includ-\ning those performing control functions, are remunerated indepen-\ndently from the performance of the businesses they oversee and \nsupport. As with the business divisions, risk, control, compliance \nand ethical considerations and relative performance compared \nto peers, as well as the market and regulatory environment, are \ntaken into account.\n\nFor 2018, the Compensation Committee noted the 52% increase \nin Group adjusted income before taxes, from CHF 2.8 billion in \n2017 to CHF\xc2\xa04.2 billion in 2018, and acknowledged that the \nGroup had successfully delivered against its strategic priorities, \nincluding a strengthened capital position since 2015, achieve-\nment of its target for adjusted operating cost base, closure of \nthe Strategic Resolution Unit, de-risking of the Global Mar-\nkets activities, and greater allocation of capital to the Wealth \nManagement-related and Investment Banking & Capital Markets \nbusinesses, which typically generate higher returns and are less \nvolatile. The Compensation Committee also considered a range of \nother factors such as relative performance versus peers, market \nposition and market trends, as well as control, risk and ethical \nconsiderations. In terms of the market environment however, the \nCompensation Committee noted that conditions in the second \nhalf of 2018 became more challenging for the financial services \nindustry, with a significant drop in client activity resulting from a \ncombination of factors including increasing trade tensions, rising \nUS interest rates and greater geopolitical uncertainty. Against \nthe backdrop of these conditions, the Compensation Committee \ndecided to keep the Group variable compensation pool stable to \nthe previous year, notwithstanding an increase in adjusted income \nbefore taxes of 52% over the same period. As such, to protect \nreturns and profitability in light of downward pressure on revenues \n\nduring the second half of the year, the Compensation Committee \nproposed an overall Group pool of CHF\xc2\xa03,195 million, which was \napproved by the Board. \n > Adjusted results are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain \nitems included in our reported results. Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cReconciliation of adjusted \nresults\xe2\x80\x9d in I \xe2\x80\x93 Information on the company \xe2\x80\x93 Strategy and II \xe2\x80\x93 Operating and \nfinancial review \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse for further information.\n\nCompetitive benchmarking\nThe assessment of the economic and competitive environment is \nan important element of the compensation process as the Group \nstrives for market-informed, competitive compensation levels. \nInternal expertise and the services of compensation consulting \nfirms are used to benchmark compensation levels against relevant \npeers, taking into account geographical variations. The Com-\npensation Committee is provided with regular reports from an \nindependent compensation adviser on industry and market trends, \nincluding competitor performance and pay trends. The peers con-\nsidered for the purposes of Group peer benchmarking are Bank \nof America, Barclays, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, \nJPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and UBS. Specific bench-\nmarking may include other peers, depending on the business area \nor geographic location, as appropriate.\n\nFor consideration of European and local practices, the Compen-\nsation Committee also references a cross-industry peer group \nof Europe-headquartered multinational companies selected on \nthe basis of comparability to Credit Suisse in size, scale, global \nscope of operations and economic influence. In addition to the \ncompanies already listed above and those included as part of the \nExecutive Board LTI award RTSR peer group, peers considered \nfor Executive Board compensation include: AstraZeneca, Com-\nmerzbank, HSBC, Investor AB, Merck KGaA, Novartis, Standard \nLife Aberdeen and UniCredit. \n\nFocus on risk and control\n\nRisk and control considerations are an integral part of the perfor-\nmance assessment and compensation processes. This ensures \nthat the Group\xe2\x80\x99s approach to compensation includes a focus on \nrisk and internal control matters and discourages excessive risk \ntaking. Senior management from the Group\xe2\x80\x99s corporate func-\ntions, including Compliance and Regulatory Affairs, General \nCounsel, Human Resources, Internal Audit, Product Control and \n\nCompensation\n\n257\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nRisk Management, provide the Compensation Committee with \ncomprehensive feedback on regulatory, audit, disciplinary and \nrisk-related issues or trends across the Group, relevant to the \nassessment of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s risk and control culture. Divisions are \nassessed against risk and conduct measures for the year, and the \nconsolidated findings are presented to the Compensation Com-\nmittee and the CEO. Based on these assessments, the Compen-\nsation Committee may approve adjustments to the divisional pool \nlevels as proposed by the CEO.\n\nAside from risk considerations, disciplinary events may also impact \ncompensation decisions. Conduct and Ethics Boards (CEBs) \nreview all disciplinary events and decide on disciplinary sanctions \nproposed by the recommendation teams, which include represen-\ntatives from the control functions. CEBs have been established at \nthe Group-wide level, as well as for each business division and the \n\ncorporate functions overall. The Group CEB meets on a quarterly \nbasis to ensure that sanctions applied are in line with the Group\xe2\x80\x99s \nrisk appetite, market practice and regulatory requirements.\n\nMalus and clawback provisions\n\nAll deferred compensation awards granted contain malus provi-\nsions that enable the Group to reduce or cancel the awards prior \nto settlement if the participant engages in certain detrimental \nconduct. Malus provisions were enforced during the course of \n2018. All variable incentive compensation granted to UK PRA \nCode Staff and employees regulated by the Bank of Italy are sub-\nject to clawback. Other EU-regulated employees are also subject \nto clawback provisions as required by applicable legal or regula-\ntory requirements. \n\nApplication\n\nScope/Criteria\n\nMalus\n\nClawback\n\np

Our philosophy is to provide a discrimi-\nnation-free compensation system for all employees based on their \ncontribution and regardless of their background, including gender.\n\nEqual pay for our employees is set forth in our Group Compen-\nsation policy which states that all employment-related decisions, \nincluding decisions on compensation are based on an individual\xe2\x80\x99s \nqualifications, performance and behavior, or other legitimate busi-\nness considerations, such as the profitability of the Group or the \ndivision and department of the individual, and the strategic needs \nof the Group.\n\nWe design our compensation system to be compliant with appli-\ncable laws regarding equal and gender pay. In the UK, we publish \nthe gender pay gap report in line with regulatory requirements \nand we are implementing measures to address this gap. We were \none of the first banks signing up to HM Treasury\xe2\x80\x99s Women in \nFinance Charter, promising support for transitioning women into \nsenior roles. We are also involved in numerous opportunities to \npromote gender diversity and talent including Women on Board, \nWomen in Banking and Finance and Modern Muse and Tech She \nCan.\n\nGroup estimated unrecognized compensation expense\nThe following table shows the estimated compensation expense \nthat has not yet been recognized through the income statement \nfor deferred compensation awards granted for 2018 and prior \nyears that were outstanding as of December 31, 2018, with com-\nparative information for 2017.

Employee \npledging of unvested, or vested and undistributed share-based \nawards is also prohibited, except with the approval of the Com-\npensation Committee. These provisions also apply to Executive \nBoard members.\n\nImpact of share-based compensation on shareholders\xe2\x80\x99 \nequity\nIn general, the income statement expense recognition of share-\nbased awards on a pre-tax basis has a neutral impact on share-\nholders\xe2\x80\x99 equity because the reduction to shareholders\xe2\x80\x99 equity \nfrom the expense recognition is offset by the obligation to deliver \nshares, which is recognized as an increase to equity by a cor-\nresponding amount. Shareholders\xe2\x80\x99 equity includes, as additional \npaid-in capital, the tax benefits associated with the expensing \nand subsequent settlement of share-based awards.\n\nIn 2018, the Group\xe2\x80\x99s share delivery obligations were covered by \nshares purchased in the market. The Group intends to continue \n\nto cover its future share delivery obligations through market \npurchases.\n\nShare-based awards outstanding\nAt the end of 2018, there were 138.3 million share-based awards \noutstanding, of which 83.2 million were share awards, 51.7 million \nwere performance share awards and 3.4 million were CCA share \nawards. \n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cNote 28 \xe2\x80\x93 Employee deferred compensation\xe2\x80\x9d in VI \xe2\x80\x93 Consolidated \n\nfinancial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group for further information.\n\nSubsequent activity\nIn early 2019, the Group granted approximately 55.6 million new \nshare awards and 46.1 million new performance share awards \nwith respect to performance in 2018. Further, the Group awarded \nCHF\xc2\xa0299 million of deferred variable incentive compensation in \nthe form of CCA pursuant to the Group\xe2\x80\x99s compensation policy.\n\nIn the first half of 2019, the Group plans to settle 62.9 million \ndeferred awards from prior years, including 36.3 million share \nawards and 23.2 million performance share awards. The Group \nplans to meet this delivery obligation through market purchases.\n\n262\n\nCompensation\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cCapital management\xe2\x80\x9d in III \xe2\x80\x93 Treasury, Risk, Balance sheet and Off-\n\nbalance sheet for more information.\n\nChanges to the value of outstanding deferred awards\nEmployees experience changes to the value of their deferred \ncompensation awards during the vesting period due to both \nimplicit and explicit value changes. Implicit value changes primar-\nily reflect market-driven effects, such as changes in the Group \nshare price, changes in the value of the COF, CCA and foreign \nexchange rate movements.

The procedures selected depend on the auditor\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, including the assessment of the \nrisks of material misstatements in the compensation report, whether due to fraud or error. This audit also \nincludes evaluating the reasonableness of the methods applied to value components of compensation, as \nwell as assessing the overall presentation of the compensation report.\n\nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our \nopinion. \n\nOpinion\n\nIn our opinion, the compensation report for the year ended December 31, 2018 of the Group complies with \nSwiss law and articles 14 \xe2\x80\x93 16 of the Ordinance.\n\nKPMG AG\n\nNicholas Edmonds\nLicensed Audit Expert\nAuditor in Charge\n\nZurich, Switzerland\nMarch 22, 2019\n\n \n\nRalph Dicht\nLicensed Audit Expert\n\nKPMG AG, Badenerstrasse 172, PO Box, CH-8036 Zurich\n\nKPMG AG is a subsidiary of KPMG Holding AG, which is a member of the KPMG network of independent firms affiliated with KPMG International Cooperative \n(\xe2\x80\x9cKPMG International\xe2\x80\x9d), a Swiss legal entity.

Statutory Auditor on the Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nOpinion \n \nAs  statutory  auditor,  we  have  audited  the  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  of  Credit  Suisse \nGroup AG and subsidiaries (the \xe2\x80\x9cGroup\xe2\x80\x9d), which comprise the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, \n2018  and  2017,  and  the  related  consolidated  statements  of  operations,  comprehensive  income,  changes  in \nequity and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2018, and the related \nnotes. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position as \nof December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of operations and the cash flows for each of the years in the \nthree-year period ended December 31, 2018, in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, \nand comply with Swiss law. \n \n \nBoard of Directors\xe2\x80\x99 Responsibility \n \nThe Board of Directors is responsible for the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance \nwith  U.S. Generally  Accepted  Accounting  Principles  and  the  requirements  of  Swiss  law.  This  responsibility \nincludes designing, implementing and maintaining an internal control system relevant to the preparation and fair \npresentation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud \nor error. The Board of Directors is further responsible for selecting and applying appropriate accounting policies \nand making accounting estimates that are reasonable in the circumstances. \n \n \nAuditor\xe2\x80\x99s Responsibility \n \nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We \nare a public accounting firm and are required to be independent with respect to the Group. We conducted our \naudits in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards and the standards of the Public Company \nAccounting Oversight Board (United States) (\xe2\x80\x9cPCAOB\xe2\x80\x9d). Those standards require that we plan and perform the \naudits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free from material \nmisstatement whether due to fraud or error.  \n \nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the \nconsolidated financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, including the \nassessment of the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to fraud \nor error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers the internal control system relevant to the \nentity\xe2\x80\x99s  preparation  of  the  consolidated  financial  statements  in  order  to  design  audit  procedures  that  are \nappropriate  in  the  circumstances.  An  audit  also  includes  evaluating  the  appropriateness  of  the  accounting \npolicies  used  and  the  reasonableness  of  accounting  estimates  made,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall \npresentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is \nsufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n267\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n    \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nReport on Key Audit Matters based on the circular 1/2015 of the Federal Audit \nOversight Authority \nValuation of financial instruments reported at fair value \n \n \nGoodwill \n \n \nValuation of deferred tax assets \n \n \nProvisions for litigation and regulatory actions \n \n \nValuation of the allowance for loan losses \n \n \nControls over IT systems impacting financial reporting  \n \nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of \nthe consolidated financial statements of the current period.

These financial assets represented 37% of total \nassets and these financial liabilities represented 25% of \ntotal liabilities as of December 31, 2018. \n \nThe fair value of the majority of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s financial \ninstruments is based on quoted prices in active markets \nor observable inputs. \n \nIn  addition,  the  Group  holds  financial  instruments  for \nwhich no prices are available and which have little or no \nobservable inputs. For these financial instruments fair \nvalue is determined through the application of valuation \nthe  exercise  of \ntechniques,  which  often \njudgment  by  management \nthe  use  of \nassumptions  and  estimates.  In  particular  for  financial \ninstruments  which  do  not  have  directly  observable \nmarket prices, judgment is often required to determine \nmodelling  assumptions \nthe \ndetermination of fair value. The Group also has certain \nfinancial instruments that utilize significant, judgmental \ninputs  with  varying  degrees  of  observability \nfor \npurposes of determining fair value. Further, the Group \napplies  significant  judgment  in  calculating  certain \n\nthat  are  used \n\nincluding \n\ninvolve \n\nin \n\nWe  assessed  and  tested  the  design  and  operating \neffectiveness of the key controls over financial reporting \nwith  respect  to  the  valuation  of  financial  instruments \nreported  at  fair  value.

We compared observable inputs and data against \nindependent  sources  and  externally  available  market \ndata. \n \nFor a sample of instruments which do not have directly \nobservable  market  prices,  we  critically  examined  and \nchallenged  the  assumptions  and  models  used  or  re-\nperformed  an  independent  valuation  assessment,  by \nreference  to  what  we  considered  to  be  available \nalternative methods and sensitivities to key factors. \n \nWe also evaluated the methodology and inputs used in \ndetermining  key \njudgmental  valuation  adjustments \n(including \nvaluation \nadjustments)  by  critically  examining  and  challenging \nthese  assumptions  and  models,  and  performing \nrecalculations for a sample of these adjustments. \n\ncredit,  debit,  and \n\nfunding \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n268-I\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nvaluation  adjustments \nfunding valuation adjustments. \n\nincluding  credit,  debit  and \n\nWe  made  use  of  our  own  valuation  specialists  in \nperforming the above procedures, in particular in relation \nto  the  most  judgmental  financial  instruments,  models, \nmethodologies and assumptions. \n\nFor further information on the valuation of financial instruments reported at fair value refer to the following: \n\n\xe2\x80\x94  Note 1 Summary of significant accounting policies, \xe2\x80\x9cFair value measurement and option\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cTrading assets and \n\nliabilities\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n\xe2\x80\x94  Note 16 Trading assets and liabilities \n\xe2\x80\x94  Note 35 Financial instruments \n\nGoodwill \n\nKey Audit Matter \n\nOur response \n\nthe  Group  concluded  no \n\nThe Group reports goodwill totalling CHF 4.8 billion as \nof  December  31,  2018.  Goodwill  is  allocated  to \nreporting  units  and  the  carrying  value  is  primarily \nsupported  by  the  future  cash  flows  of  the  underlying \nbusinesses. During 2018, the Group determined that a \ngoodwill triggering event occurred for the Asia Pacific \xe2\x80\x93 \nMarkets,  Global  Markets  and  Investment  Banking  & \nCapital Markets reporting units. Based on its goodwill \nimpairment  analysis  performed  as  of  December  31, \n2018, \nimpairment  was \nnecessary. \n \nDue  to  the  inherent  uncertainty  associated  with  the \nforecasts  used  in  determining  the  fair  value  of  each \nreporting  unit,  this  is  an  area  in  which  significant \njudgment  is  applied.  There  is  a  greater  degree  of \nsensitivity  to  the  impact  of  changes  to  estimates  of \nfuture cash flows and other key assumptions for those \nreporting units where headroom between fair value and \ncarrying value is limited. \n\nWe  assessed  and  tested  the  design  and  operating \neffectiveness of the key controls over financial reporting \nwith  respect  to  the  valuation  of  goodwill. This  included \ncontrols over the annual impairment analysis, including \nthe  assumptions  used  in  determining  the  fair  value  of \neach reporting unit, the development and approval of the \nfinancial plan, and management\xe2\x80\x99s annual comparison of \nforecasts to past performance. \n \nWe  evaluated \nflow \nprojections  and  compared  key  inputs,  such  as  the \ndiscount rates and growth rates, to externally available \nindustry,  economic  and  financial  data  and  the  Group\xe2\x80\x99s \nown historical data and performance. With the assistance \nof our own valuation specialists, we critically examined \nand  challenged  the  assumptions  and  methodologies \nused  to  calculate  fair  value  for  those  reporting  units \nwhere  the  impact  of  changes  to  key  estimates  and \nassumptions was most sensitive. \n\nreasonableness  of  cash \n\nthe \n\nFor further information on goodwill refer to the following: \n\n\xe2\x80\x94  Note 1 Summary of significant accounting policies, \xe2\x80\x9cGoodwill and other intangible assets\xe2\x80\x9d \n\xe2\x80\x94  Note 21 Goodwill \n\nValuation of deferred tax assets \n\nKey Audit Matter \n\nOur response \n\nThe Group reports net deferred tax assets totalling  \nCHF 4.5 billion as of December 31, 2018. \n \nSignificant judgment is required in relation to deferred \ntax  assets  as  their  recoverability  is  dependent  on \n\nWe  assessed  and  tested  the  design  and  operating \neffectiveness of the key controls over financial reporting \nwith respect to the valuation of deferred tax assets.

This  also  included  controls  over  model \napproval, validation and approval of key data inputs and \nthe  qualitative  considerations  for  potential  impairment \nthat were not captured by management\xe2\x80\x99s models. \n \nFor a sample of loan loss allowances calculated on an \nindividual  basis  we  tested  the  assumptions  underlying \nthe impairment identification and quantification including \nforecasts  of  future  cash  flows,  valuation  of  underlying \ncollateral and estimates of recovery on default. We also \nexamined  a  sample  of  loans  which  had  not  been \nidentified  by  management  as  impaired  and  formed  our \nown opinion about collectability. \n \nFor  a  sample  of  loan  loss  allowances  calculated  on  a \ncollective  basis  we \nthe  underlying  models \nincluding the model approval and validation process.

accompanying consolidated financial statements of Credit \nSuisse Group AG (the Group) are prepared in accordance with \naccounting principles generally accepted in the US (US GAAP) \nand are stated in Swiss francs (CHF). The financial year for the \nGroup ends on December\xc2\xa031. Certain reclassifications have been \nmade to the prior year\xe2\x80\x99s consolidated financial statements to \nconform to the current presentation which had no impact on net \nincome/(loss) or total shareholders\xe2\x80\x99 equity.\n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management \nis required to make estimates and assumptions including, but not \nlimited to, the fair value measurements of certain financial assets \nand liabilities, the allowance for loan losses, the evaluation of vari-\nable interest entities (VIEs), the impairment of assets other than \nloans, recognition of deferred tax assets, tax uncertainties, pen-\nsion liabilities and various contingencies. These estimates and \nassumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabili-\nties and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of \nthe dates of the consolidated balance sheets and the reported \namounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. \nWhile management evaluates its estimates and assumptions on \nan ongoing basis, actual results could differ materially from man-\nagement\xe2\x80\x99s estimates. Market conditions may increase the risk \nand complexity of the judgments applied in these estimates.\n\nForeign currency translation \n\nTransactions denominated in currencies other than the functional \ncurrency of the related entity are recorded by remeasuring them \nin the functional currency of the related entity using the foreign \nexchange rate on the date of the transaction. As of the dates of \nthe consolidated balance sheets, monetary assets and liabilities, \nsuch as receivables and payables, are reported using the year-\nend spot foreign exchange rates. Foreign exchange rate differ-\nences are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations. \nNon-monetary assets and liabilities are recorded using the his-\ntoric exchange rate.\n\nFor the purpose of consolidation, the assets and liabilities of \nGroup companies with functional currencies other than the Swiss \nfranc are translated into Swiss franc equivalents using year-end \nspot foreign exchange rates, whereas revenues and expenses \nare translated at weighted average foreign exchange rates for \nthe period. Translation adjustments arising from consolidation \nare included in accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) \n(AOCI) within total shareholders\xe2\x80\x99 equity. Cumulative translation \nadjustments are released from AOCI and recorded in the con-\nsolidated statements of operations when the Group disposes and \nloses control of a consolidated foreign subsidiary.\n\nPrinciples of consolidation \n\nFair value measurement and option\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the financial state-\nments of the Group and its subsidiaries. The Group\xe2\x80\x99s subsidiar-\nies are entities in which it holds, directly or indirectly, more than \n50% of the voting rights or where it exercises control. The Group \nconsolidates limited partnerships in cases where it is the general \npartner and the limited partners do not have either substantive \nkick out rights and/or substantive participating rights or is a lim-\nited partner with substantive rights to kick out the general partner \nor dissolve the partnership and participate in significant decisions \nmade in the ordinary course of business. The Group also consoli-\ndates VIEs if the Group is the primary beneficiary in accordance \nwith Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 810 \xe2\x80\x93 Con-\nsolidation. The effects of material intercompany transactions and \nbalances have been eliminated. \n\nWhere a Group subsidiary is a separate legal entity and deter-\nmined to be an investment company as defined by ASC Topic \n946 \xe2\x80\x93 Financial Services \xe2\x80\x93 Investment Companies, interests in \nother entities held by this Group subsidiary are not consolidated \nand are carried at fair value.\n\nGroup entities that qualify as broker-dealer entities as defined by \nASC Topic 940 \xe2\x80\x93 Financial Services \xe2\x80\x93 Brokers and Dealers do \nnot consolidate investments in voting interest entities that would \notherwise qualify for consolidation when the investment is held on \na temporary basis for trading purposes. In addition, subsidiaries \nthat are strategic components of a broker-dealer\xe2\x80\x99s operations are \nconsolidated regardless of holding intent.\n\n276\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\nThe fair value measurement guidance establishes a single \nauthoritative definition of fair value and sets out a framework for \nmeasuring fair value. The fair value option creates an alternative \nmeasurement treatment for certain financial assets and financial \nliabilities. The fair value option can be elected at initial recognition \nof the eligible item or at the date when the Group enters into an \nagreement which gives rise to an eligible item (e.g., a firm com-\nmitment or a written loan commitment). If not elected at initial \nrecognition, the fair value option can be applied to an item upon \ncertain triggering events that give rise to a new basis of account-\ning for that item. The application of the fair value option to a \nfinancial asset or a financial liability does not change its classifica-\ntion on the face of the balance sheet and the election is irrevoca-\nble. Changes in fair value resulting from the election are recorded \nin trading revenues.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cFair value option\xe2\x80\x9d in Note\xc2\xa035 \xe2\x80\x93 Financial instruments for further \n\ninformation.\n\nCash and due from banks\n\nCash and due from banks consists of currency on hand, demand \ndeposits with banks or other financial institutions and cash equiv-\nalents. Cash equivalents are defined as short-term, highly liquid \ninstruments with original maturities of three months or less, which \nare held for cash management purposes.\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nReverse repurchase and repurchase agreements \n\nPurchases of securities under agreements to resell (reverse \nrepurchase agreements) and securities sold under agreements to \nrepurchase substantially identical securities (repurchase agree-\nments) do not constitute economic sales and are therefore \ntreated as collateralized financing transactions, which are carried \nin the consolidated balance sheet at the amount of cash dis-\nbursed or received, respectively. Reverse repurchase agreements \nare recorded as collateralized assets while repurchase agree-\nments are recorded as liabilities, with the underlying securities \nsold continuing to be recognized in trading assets or investment \nsecurities. The fair value of securities to be repurchased and \nresold is monitored on a daily basis, and additional collateral is \nobtained as needed to protect against credit exposure.\n\nAssets and liabilities recorded under these agreements are \naccounted for on one of two bases, the accrual basis or the fair \nvalue basis. Under the accrual basis, interest earned on reverse \nrepurchase agreements and interest incurred on repurchase \nagreements are reported in interest and dividend income and \ninterest expense, respectively. The fair value basis of account-\ning may be elected pursuant to ASC Topic 825 \xe2\x80\x93 Financial \nInstruments, and any resulting change in fair value is reported \nin trading revenues. Accrued interest income and expense are \nrecorded in the same manner as under the accrual method. The \nGroup has elected the fair value basis of accounting on selected \nagreements.\n\nReverse repurchase and repurchase agreements are netted if \nthey are with the same counterparty, have the same maturity \ndate, settle through the same clearing institution and are subject \nto the same enforceable master netting agreement.\n\nSecurities lending and borrowing transactions \n\nSecurities borrowed and securities loaned that are cash-collater-\nalized are included in the consolidated balance sheets at amounts \nequal to the cash advanced or received. If securities received in \na securities lending and borrowing transaction as collateral may \nbe sold or repledged, they are recorded as securities received as \ncollateral in the consolidated balance sheet and a corresponding \nliability to return the security is recorded. Securities lending trans-\nactions against non-cash collateral in which the Group has the \nright to resell or repledge the collateral received are recorded at \nthe fair value of the collateral initially received. For securities lend-\ning transactions, the Group receives cash or securities collateral \nin an amount generally in excess of the market value of securities \nlent. The Group monitors the fair value of securities borrowed \nand loaned on a daily basis with additional collateral obtained as \nnecessary.\n\ninterest income and expense are recorded in the same manner as \nunder the accrual method.\n\nTransfers of financial assets\n\nThe Group transfers various financial assets, which may result in \nthe sale of these assets to special purpose entities (SPEs), which \nin turn issue securities to investors. The Group values its ben-\neficial interests at fair value using quoted market prices, if such \npositions are traded on an active exchange or financial models \nthat incorporate observable and unobservable inputs.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cNote\xc2\xa034 \xe2\x80\x93 Transfers of financial assets and variable interest entities\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nfor further information on the Group\xe2\x80\x99s transfer activities.\n\nTrading assets and liabilities\n\nTrading assets and liabilities include debt securities, marketable \nequity instruments, derivative instruments, certain loans held in \nbroker-dealer entities, commodities and precious metals. Items \nincluded in the trading portfolio are carried at fair value and clas-\nsified as held for trading purposes based on management\xe2\x80\x99s \nintent. Regular-way security transactions are recorded on a trade-\ndate basis. Unrealized and realized gains and losses on trading \npositions are recorded in trading revenues.\n\nDerivatives\n\nFreestanding derivative contracts are carried at fair value in the \nconsolidated balance sheets regardless of whether these instru-\nments are held for trading or risk management purposes. Com-\nmitments to originate mortgage loans that will be held for sale are \nconsidered derivatives for accounting purposes. When derivative \nfeatures embedded in certain contracts that meet the definition of \na derivative are not considered clearly and closely related to the \nhost contract, either the embedded feature is accounted for sep-\narately at fair value or the entire contract, including the embedded \nfeature, is accounted for at fair value. In both cases, changes in \nfair value are recorded in the consolidated statements of opera-\ntions. If separated for measurement purposes, the derivative is \nrecorded in the same line item in the consolidated balance sheets \nas the host contract.\n\nDerivatives classified as trading assets and liabilities include those \nheld for trading purposes and those used for risk management \npurposes that do not qualify for hedge accounting. Derivatives \nheld for trading purposes arise from proprietary trading activ-\nity and from customer-based activity. Realized gains and losses, \nchanges in unrealized gains and losses and interest flows are \nincluded in trading revenues. Derivative contracts designated and \nqualifying as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or net invest-\nment hedges are reported as other assets or other liabilities.\n\nFees and interest received or paid are recorded in interest and \ndividend income and interest expense, respectively, on an accrual \nbasis. If the fair value basis of accounting is elected, any result-\ning change in fair value is reported in trading revenues. Accrued \n\nThe fair value of exchange-traded derivatives is typically derived \nfrom observable market prices and/or observable market param-\neters. Fair values for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives are \ndetermined on the basis of proprietary models using various input \n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n277\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nparameters. Derivative contracts are recorded on a net basis per \ncounterparty, where an enforceable master netting agreement \nexists. Where no such agreement exists, fair values are recorded \non a gross basis.\n\nWhere hedge accounting is applied, the Group formally docu-\nments all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged \nitems, including the risk management objectives and strategy for \nundertaking hedge transactions. At inception of a hedge and on \nan ongoing basis, the hedge relationship is formally assessed to \ndetermine whether the derivatives that are used in hedging trans-\nactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or \ncash flows of hedged items attributable to the hedged risk. The \nGroup discontinues hedge accounting prospectively in the follow-\ning circumstances:\n(i)  the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the \nfair value or cash flows of a hedged item (including forecasted \ntransactions);\n\n(ii) the derivative expires or is sold, terminated or exercised;\n(iii) the derivative is no longer designated as a hedging instrument \nbecause it is unlikely that the forecasted transaction will occur; \nor\n\n(iv) the designation of the derivative as a hedging instrument is \n\notherwise no longer appropriate.\n\nFor derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value \nhedges, the carrying value of the underlying hedged items is \nadjusted to fair value for the risk being hedged. Changes in the \nfair value of these derivatives are recorded in the same line item \nof the consolidated statements of operations as the change in fair \nvalue of the risk being hedged for the hedged assets or liabilities \nto the extent the hedge is effective. The change in fair value rep-\nresenting hedge ineffectiveness is recorded separately in trading \nrevenues.\n\nWhen the Group discontinues fair value hedge accounting \nbecause it determines that the derivative no longer qualifies as an \neffective fair value hedge, the derivative will continue to be car-\nried in the consolidated balance sheets at its fair value, and the \nhedged asset or liability will no longer be adjusted for changes \nin fair value attributable to the hedged risk. Interest-related fair \nvalue adjustments made to the underlying hedged items will be \namortized to the consolidated statements of operations over the \nremaining life of the hedged item. Any unamortized interest-\nrelated fair value adjustment is recorded in the consolidated state-\nments of operations upon sale or extinguishment of the hedged \nasset or liability, respectively. Any other fair value hedge adjust-\nments remain part of the carrying amount of the hedged asset \nor liability and are recognized in the consolidated statements of \noperations upon disposition of the hedged item as part of the gain \nor loss on disposition.\n\nFor hedges of the variability of cash flows from forecasted \ntransactions and floating rate assets or liabilities, the effective \nportion of the change in the fair value of a designated deriva-\ntive is recorded in AOCI. These amounts are reclassified into the \nline item in the consolidated statements of operations in which \n\n278\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\nthe hedged item is recorded when the variable cash flow from \nthe hedged item impacts earnings (for example, when periodic \nsettlements on a variable rate asset or liability are recorded in the \nconsolidated statements of operations or when the hedged item \nis disposed of). The change in fair value representing hedge inef-\nfectiveness is recorded separately in trading revenues.\n\nWhen hedge accounting is discontinued on a cash flow hedge, \nthe net gain or loss will remain in AOCI and be reclassified into \nthe consolidated statements of operations in the same period or \nperiods during which the formerly hedged transaction is reported \nin the consolidated statements of operations. When the Group \ndiscontinues hedge accounting because it is probable that a \nforecasted transaction will not occur within the specified date or \nperiod plus two months, the derivative will continue to be carried \nin the consolidated balance sheets at its fair value, and gains and \nlosses that were previously recorded in AOCI will be recognized \nimmediately in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\nFor hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation, the change \nin the fair value of the hedging derivative is recorded in AOCI to \nthe extent the hedge is effective. The change in fair value rep-\nresenting hedge ineffectiveness is recorded in trading revenues. \nThe Group uses the forward method of determining effectiveness \nfor net investment hedges, which results in the time value por-\ntion of a foreign currency forward being reported in AOCI to the \nextent the hedge is effective.\n\nInvestment securities\n\nInvestment securities include debt securities classified as held-to-\nmaturity and debt securities classified as available-for-sale. Regu-\nlar-way security transactions are recorded on a trade-date basis.\n\nDebt securities where the Group has the positive intent and abil-\nity to hold such securities to maturity are classified as such and \nare carried at amortized cost, net of any unamortized premium or \ndiscount.\n\nDebt securities classified as available-for-sale are carried at fair \nvalue. Unrealized gains and losses, which represent the differ-\nence between fair value and amortized cost, are recorded in \nAOCI. Amounts reported in AOCI are net of income taxes.\n\nAmortization of premiums or discounts is recorded in interest and \ndividend income using the effective yield method through the \nmaturity date of the security.\n\nRecognition of an impairment on debt securities is recorded in \nthe consolidated statements of operations if a decline in fair value \nbelow amortized cost is considered other-than-temporary, that is, \namounts due according to the contractual terms of the security \nare not considered collectible, typically due to deterioration in the \ncreditworthiness of the issuer. No impairment is recorded in con-\nnection with declines resulting from changes in interest rates to \nthe extent the Group does not intend to sell the investments, nor \nis it more likely than not that the Group will be required to sell the \n\n\x0c \n\n \n\ninvestments before the recovery of their amortized cost bases, \nwhich may be maturity.\n\nRecognition of an impairment for debt securities establishes a \nnew cost basis, which is not adjusted for subsequent recoveries.\n\nUnrealized losses on available-for-sale securities are recognized \nin the consolidated statements of operations when a decision has \nbeen made to sell a security.\n\nOther investments\n\nOther investments include equity method investments, equity \nsecurities without a readily determinable fair value, such as hedge \nfunds, private equity securities and certain investments in non-\nmarketable mutual funds for which the Group has neither sig-\nnificant influence nor control over the investee, and real estate \nheld-for-investment.\n\nEquity method investments are investments for which the Group \nhas the ability to significantly influence the operating and financial \npolicies. Significant influence is typically characterized by owner-\nship of 20% to 50% of the voting stock or in-substance com-\nmon stock of a corporation or 5% or more of limited partnership \ninterests. Equity method investments are accounted for under the \nequity method of accounting or the fair value option. Under the \nequity method of accounting, the Group\xe2\x80\x99s proportionate share of \nthe profit or loss, and any impairment on the investee, if appli-\ncable, is reported in other revenues. Under the fair value option, \nchanges in fair value are reported in other revenues. The Group \nhas elected the fair value basis of accounting on some of its \nequity method investments.\n\nEquity securities without a readily determinable fair value are car-\nried at fair value, net asset value practical expedient to estimate \nfair value or at cost less impairment, adjusted for observable price \nchanges (measurement alternative). Memberships in exchanges \nare reported at cost, less impairment. Equity securities without \na readily determinable fair value held by the Group\xe2\x80\x99s subsidiaries \nthat are determined to be investment companies as defined by \nASC Topic 946 \xe2\x80\x93 Financial Services \xe2\x80\x93 Investment Companies are \ncarried at fair value, with changes in fair value recorded in other \nrevenues.\n\nEquity method investments and equity securities without a read-\nily determinable fair value held by subsidiaries that are within \nthe scope of ASC Topic 940 \xe2\x80\x93 Financial Services \xe2\x80\x93 Brokers \nand Dealers are measured at fair value and reported in trading \nassets when the intent of the broker-dealer entity is to hold the \nasset temporarily for trading purposes. Changes in fair value are \nreported in trading revenues. Equity securities without a readily \ndeterminable fair value include investments in entities that regu-\nlarly calculate net asset value per share or its equivalent, with \nchanges in fair value recorded in other revenue.\n\nReal estate held-for-investment purposes is carried at cost less \naccumulated depreciation and is depreciated over its estimated \n\nuseful life, generally 40 to 67 years. Land that is classified as real \nestate held-for-investment purposes is carried at historical cost \nand is not depreciated. Real estate held-for-investment purposes \nis tested for impairment annually, or more frequently, if events or \nchanges in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may \nnot be recoverable. For real estate held-for-investment purposes, \nthe fair values were measured based on either discounted cash \nflow analyses or external market appraisals. Recognition of an \nimpairment on such assets establishes a new cost base, which is \nnot adjusted for subsequent recoveries in value.\n\nLoans\n\nLoans held-to-maturity\nLoans which the Group intends to hold until maturity are carried \nat outstanding principal balances plus accrued interest, net of the \nfollowing items: unamortized premiums, discounts on purchased \nloans, deferred loan origination fees and direct loan origina-\ntion costs on originated loans. Interest income is accrued on the \nunpaid principal balance and net deferred premiums/discounts \nand fees/costs are amortized as an adjustment to the loan yield \nover the term of the related loans.\n\nLease financing transactions where the Group is the lessor are \nclassified as loans. Unearned income is amortized to interest and \ndividend income over the lease term using the effective interest \nmethod.\n\nIn accordance with Group policies, impaired loans include non-\nperforming loans, non-interest-earning loans, restructured loans \nand potential problem loans.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cNote\xc2\xa019 \xe2\x80\x93 Loans, allowance for loan losses and credit quality\xe2\x80\x9d for \n\nfurther information.\n\nAllowance for loan losses on loans held-to-maturity\nThe allowance for loan losses is composed of the following com-\nponents: probable credit losses inherent in the portfolio and those \nlosses specifically identified. Changes in the allowance for loan \nlosses are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations \nin provision for credit losses and in interest income (for provisions \non past due interest).\n\nThe Group evaluates many factors when estimating the allowance \nfor loan losses, including the volatility of default probabilities, rat-\ning changes, the magnitude of potential loss, internal risk ratings, \nand geographic, industry and other economic factors. The com-\nponent of the allowance representing probable losses inherent \nin the portfolio is for loans not specifically identified as impaired \nand that, on a portfolio basis, are considered to contain prob-\nable inherent loss. The estimate of this component of the allow-\nance for the consumer loans portfolio involves applying historical \nand current default probabilities, historical recovery experience \nand related current assumptions to homogenous loans based on \ninternal risk rating and product type. To estimate this component \nof the allowance for the corporate & institutional loans portfolio, \nthe Group segregates loans by risk, industry or country rating. \nExcluded from this estimate process are consumer and corporate \n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n279\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\n& institutional loans that have been specifically identified as \nimpaired or are held at fair value. For lending-related commit-\nments, a provision for losses is estimated based on historical loss \nand recovery experience and recorded in other liabilities. Changes \nin the estimate of losses for lending-related commitments are \nrecorded in the consolidated statements of operations in provision \nfor credit losses.\n\nThe estimate of the component of the allowance for specifically \nidentified credit losses on impaired loans is based on a regular \nand detailed analysis of each loan in the portfolio considering col-\nlateral and counterparty risk. The Group considers a loan impaired \nwhen, based on current information and events, it is probable that \nthe Group will be unable to collect the amounts due according to \nthe contractual terms of the loan agreement. For non-collateral-\ndependent impaired loans, an impairment is measured using the \npresent value of estimated future cash flows, except that as a \npractical expedient an impairment may be measured based on a \nloan\xe2\x80\x99s observable market price. For collateral-dependent impaired \nloans, an impairment is measured using the fair value of the \ncollateral.\n\nA loan is classified as non-performing no later than when the \ncontractual payments of principal and/or interest are more than \n90 days past due except for subprime residential loans which are \nclassified as non-performing no later than when the contrac-\ntual payments of principal and/or interest are more than 120 \ndays past due. The additional 30 days ensure that these loans \nare not incorrectly assessed as non-performing during the time \nwhen servicing of them typically is being transferred. However, \nmanagement may determine that a loan should be classified as \nnon-performing notwithstanding that contractual payments of \nprincipal and/or interest are less than 90 days past due or, in the \ncase of subprime residential loans, 120 days past due. For non-\nperforming loans, a provision is recorded in an amount equal to \nany accrued but unpaid interest at the date the loan is classi-\nfied as non-performing, resulting in a charge to the consolidated \nstatements of operations. In addition, the Group continues to add \naccrued interest receivable to the loan\xe2\x80\x99s balance for collection \npurposes; however, a provision is recorded resulting in no interest \nincome recognition. Thereafter, the outstanding principal balance \nis evaluated at least annually for collectability and a provision is \nestablished as necessary.\n\nA loan can be further downgraded to non-interest-earning when \nthe collection of interest is considered so doubtful that further \naccrual of interest is deemed inappropriate. At that time, and on \nat least a quarterly basis thereafter depending on various risk \nfactors, the outstanding principal balance, net of provisions previ-\nously recorded, is evaluated for collectability and additional provi-\nsions are established as required.\n\nGenerally, non-performing loans and non-interest-earning loans \nmay be restored to performing status only when delinquent prin-\ncipal and interest are brought up to date in accordance with the \nterms of the loan agreement and when certain performance crite-\nria are met.\n\n280\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\nInterest collected on non-performing loans and non-interest-earn-\ning loans is accounted for using the cash basis or the cost recov-\nery method or a combination of both.\n\nLoans that were modified in a troubled debt restructuring are \nreported as restructured loans. Generally, a restructured loan \nwould have been considered impaired and an associated allow-\nance for loan losses would have been established prior to the \nrestructuring. Loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring are \nreported as restructured loans to the end of the reporting year \nin which the loan was modified or for as long as an allowance \nfor loan losses based on the terms specified by the restructuring \nagreement is associated with the restructured loan or an interest \nconcession made at the time of the restructuring exists. In mak-\ning the determination of whether an interest rate concession has \nbeen made, market interest rates for loans with comparable risk \nto borrowers of the same credit quality are considered. Loans \nthat have been restructured in a troubled debt restructuring and \nare performing according to the new terms continue to accrue \ninterest. Loan restructurings may include the receipt of assets \nin satisfaction of the loan, the modification of loan terms (e.g., \nreduction of interest rates, extension of maturity dates at a stated \ninterest rate lower than the current market rate for new loans \nwith similar risk, or reduction in principal amounts and/or accrued \ninterest balances) or a combination of both.\n\nPotential problem loans are impaired loans where contractual \npayments have been received according to schedule, but where \ndoubt exists as to the collection of future contractual payments. \nPotential problem loans are evaluated for impairment on an indi-\nvidual basis and an allowance for loan losses is established as \nnecessary. Potential problem loans continue to accrue interest.\n\nThe amortization of net loan fees or costs on impaired loans is \ngenerally discontinued during the periods in which matured and \nunpaid interest or principal is outstanding. On settlement of a \nloan, if the loan balance is not collected in full, an allowance is \nestablished for the uncollected amount, if necessary, and the loan \nis then written off, net of any deferred loan fees and costs.\n\nWrite-off of a loan occurs when it is considered certain that there \nis no possibility of recovering the outstanding principal. Recover-\nies of loans previously written off are recorded based on the cash \nor estimated fair value of other assets received.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cImpaired loans\xe2\x80\x9d in Note\xc2\xa019 \xe2\x80\x93 Loans, allowance for loan losses and \n\ncredit quality for further information on the write-off of a loan and related \naccounting policies.\n\nLoans held-for-sale\nLoans, which the Group intends to sell in the foreseeable future, \nare considered held-for-sale and are carried at the lower of \namortized cost or market value determined on either an individual \nmethod basis, or in the aggregate for pools of similar loans if sold \nor securitized as a pool. Loans held-for-sale are included in other \nassets. Revaluation losses incurred at the transfer into the held-\nfor-sale category are generally recorded as credit losses. Gains \n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nand losses on loans held-for-sale subsequent to the transfer into \nthe held-for-sale category are recorded in other revenues.\n\nPurchased impaired loans\nPurchased loans for which it is probable at acquisition that all \ncontractually required payments will not be received are recorded \nat their net purchase price and no allowances are carried over. \nThe excess of the estimated cash flows to be collected over the \namount paid is accreted into interest income over the estimated \nrecovery period when reasonable estimates can be made about \nthe timing and amount of recovery. The Group does not consider \nsuch loans to be impaired at the time of acquisition. Such loans \nare deemed impaired only if the Group\xe2\x80\x99s estimate of cash to be \nreceived decreases below the estimate at the time of acquisition. \nIncreases in the estimated expected recovery are recorded as a \nreversal of allowances, if any, and then recognized as an adjust-\nment of the effective yield of the loan.\n\nLoans held at fair value under the fair value option\nLoans and loan commitments for which the fair value option \nis elected are reported at fair value with changes in fair value \nreported in trading revenues. The application of the fair value \noption does not change the loan\xe2\x80\x99s classification. Loan commit-\nments carried at fair value are recorded in other assets or other \nliabilities, respectively.\n\nPremises and equipment\n\nPremises and equipment (including equipment under operating \nleases where the Group is the lessor), with the exception of land, \nare carried at cost less accumulated depreciation.\n\nBuildings are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their \nestimated useful lives, generally 40 to 67 years, and building \nimprovements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their \nestimated useful lives, generally not exceeding five to ten years. \nLand is carried at historical cost and is not depreciated. Lease-\nhold improvements, such as alterations and improvements to \nrented premises, are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the \nshorter of the lease term or estimated useful life, which gener-\nally does not exceed ten years. Equipment, such as computers, \nmachinery, furnishings, vehicles and other tangible non-financial \nassets, is depreciated using the straight-line method over its esti-\nmated useful lives, generally three to ten years. Certain leasehold \nimprovements and equipment, such as data center power genera-\ntors, may have estimated useful lives greater than ten years.\n\nThe Group capitalizes costs relating to the acquisition, installa-\ntion and development of software with a measurable economic \nbenefit, but only if such costs are identifiable and can be reliably \nmeasured. The Group depreciates capitalized software costs on \na straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software, \ngenerally not exceeding seven years, taking into consideration the \neffects of obsolescence, technology, competition and other eco-\nnomic factors.\n\nThe Group reflects finance leasing activities for which it is the \nlessee by recording an asset in premises and equipment and a \ncorresponding liability in other liabilities at an amount equal to the \nsmaller of the present value of the minimum lease payments or \nfair value, and the leased asset is depreciated over the shorter of \nthe asset\xe2\x80\x99s estimated useful life or the lease term.\n\nGoodwill and other intangible assets\n\nGoodwill arises on the acquisition of subsidiaries and equity \nmethod investments. It is measured as the excess of the fair \nvalue of the consideration transferred, the fair value of any non-\ncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of any pre-\nviously held equity interest in the acquired subsidiary, over the \nnet of the acquisition-date fair values of the identifiable assets \nacquired and the liabilities assumed. Goodwill is not amortized; \ninstead it is tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if \nevents or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be \nimpaired. Goodwill is allocated to the Group\xe2\x80\x99s reporting units for \nthe purposes of the impairment test.\n\nOther intangible assets may be acquired individually or as part \nof a group of assets assumed in a business combination. Other \nintangible assets include but are not limited to: patents, licenses, \ncopyrights, trademarks, branch networks, mortgage servic-\ning rights, customer base and deposit relationships. Acquired \nintangible assets are initially measured at the amount of cash \ndisbursed or the fair value of other assets distributed. Other intan-\ngible assets that have a finite useful life are amortized over that \nperiod. Other intangible assets acquired after January\xc2\xa01, 2002 \nthat are determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amor-\ntized; instead they are tested for impairment annually, or more \nfrequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the \nindefinite intangible asset may be impaired. Mortgage servicing \nrights are included in non-amortizing other intangible assets and \nare carried at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized \nthrough earnings in the period in which they occur. Mortgage \nservicing rights represent the right to perform specified mortgage \nservicing activities on behalf of third parties. Mortgage servic-\ning rights are either purchased from third parties or retained upon \nsale of acquired or originated loans.\n\nRecognition of an impairment on non-financial \nassets\n\nThe Group evaluates premises and equipment and finite intan-\ngible assets for impairment at least annually and whenever events \nor changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount \nmay not be recoverable. Where the carrying amount of an asset \nexceeds the recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired \nand an impairment is recorded in general and administrative \nexpenses. Recognition of an impairment on such assets estab-\nlishes a new cost base, which is not adjusted for subsequent \nrecoveries in value.\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n281\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nIncome taxes\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the expected \nfuture tax consequences of temporary differences between the \ncarrying amounts of assets and liabilities at the dates of the con-\nsolidated balance sheets and their respective tax bases. Deferred \ntax assets and liabilities are computed using currently enacted \ntax rates and are recorded in other assets and other liabilities, \nrespectively. Income tax expense or benefit is recorded in income \ntax expense/(benefit), except to the extent the tax effect relates \nto transactions recorded directly in total shareholders\xe2\x80\x99 equity. \nDeferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance, if \nnecessary, to the amount that management believes will more \nlikely than not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are \nadjusted for the effect of changes in tax laws and rates in the \nperiod in which changes are approved by the relevant authority. \nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are presented on a net basis for \nthe same tax-paying component within the same tax jurisdiction.\n\nThe Group follows the guidance in ASC Topic 740 \xe2\x80\x93 Income \nTaxes, which sets out a consistent framework to determine the \nappropriate level of tax reserves to maintain for uncertain tax \npositions. The Group determines whether it is more likely than not \nthat an income tax position will be sustained upon examination \nbased on the technical merits of the position. Sustainable income \ntax positions are then measured to determine the amount of \nbenefit eligible for recognition in the consolidated financial state-\nments. Each such sustainable income tax position is measured \nat the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be \nrealized upon ultimate settlement.\n\nBrokerage receivables and brokerage payables\n\nThe Group recognizes receivables and payables from transactions \nin financial instruments purchased from and sold to customers, \nbanks and broker-dealers. The Group is exposed to risk of loss \nresulting from the inability of counterparties to pay for or deliver \nfinancial instruments purchased or sold, in which case the Group \nwould have to sell or purchase, respectively, these financial instru-\nments at prevailing market prices. To the extent an exchange or \nclearing organization acts as counterparty to a transaction, credit \nrisk is generally considered to be limited. The Group establishes \ncredit limits for each customer and requires them to maintain mar-\ngin collateral in compliance with applicable regulatory and inter-\nnal guidelines. In order to conduct trades with an exchange or a \nthird-party bank, the Group is required to maintain a margin. This \nis usually in the form of cash and deposited in a separate margin \naccount with the exchange or broker. If available information indi-\ncates that it is probable that a brokerage receivable is impaired, \nan allowance is established. Write-offs of brokerage receivables \noccur if the outstanding amounts are considered uncollectible.\n\nOther assets\n\nDerivative instruments used for hedging\nDerivative instruments are carried at fair value. The fair values \nof derivative instruments held for hedging are included as other \n\n282\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\nassets or other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. The \naccounting treatment used for changes in fair value of hedging \nderivatives depends on the designation of the derivative as either \na fair value hedge, cash flow hedge or hedge of a net investment \nin a foreign operation. Changes in fair value representing hedge \nineffectiveness are reported in trading revenues.\n\nCustomer deposits\n\nCustomer deposits represent funds held from customers (both \nretail and commercial) and banks and consist of interest-bearing \ndemand deposits, savings deposits and time deposits. Inter-\nest is accrued based on the contractual provisions of the deposit \ncontract.\n\nLong-term debt\n\nTotal long-term debt is composed of debt issuances which do \nnot contain derivative features (vanilla debt), as well as hybrid \ndebt instruments with embedded derivatives, which are issued as \npart of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s structured product activities. Long-term debt \nincludes both Swiss franc and foreign currency denominated fixed \nand variable rate bonds.\n\nThe Group actively manages interest rate risk and foreign cur-\nrency risk on vanilla debt through the use of derivative contracts, \nprimarily interest rate and currency swaps. In particular, fixed \nrate debt is hedged with receive-fixed, pay-floating interest rate \nswaps. The Group elected to fair value this fixed rate debt upon \nimplementation of the fair value option on January\xc2\xa01, 2007, with \nchanges in fair value recognized as a component of trading rev-\nenues, except for changes in fair value attributed to own credit \nrisk, which, since 2016, are recorded in other comprehensive \nincome, net of tax, and recycled to trading revenue when the debt \nis de-recognized. The Group did not elect to apply the fair value \noption to fixed-rate debt issued by the Group since January\xc2\xa01, \n2008 and instead applies hedge accounting per the guidance of \nASC Topic 815 \xe2\x80\x93 Derivatives and Hedging.\n\nFor capital management purposes, the Group issues hybrid capi-\ntal instruments in the form of low- and high-trigger tier\xc2\xa01 and \ntier\xc2\xa02 capital notes, with a write-off or contingent share conver-\nsion feature. Typically, these instruments have an embedded \nderivative that is bifurcated for accounting purposes. The embed-\nded derivative is measured separately and changes in fair value \nare recorded in trading revenue. The host contract is generally \naccounted for under the amortized cost method unless the fair \nvalue option has been elected and the entire instrument is carried \nat fair value.\n\nThe Group\xe2\x80\x99s long-term debt also includes various equity-linked \nand other indexed instruments with embedded derivative fea-\ntures, for which payments and redemption values are linked to \ncommodities, stocks, indices, currencies or other assets. The \nGroup elected to account for substantially all of these instru-\nments at fair value. Changes in the fair value of these instruments \n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nare recognized as a component of trading revenues, except \nfor changes in fair value attributed to own credit risk, which is \nrecorded in other comprehensive income (OCI), net of tax, and \nrecycled to trading revenue when the debt is de-recognized.\n\nOther liabilities\n\nGuarantees\nIn cases where the Group acts as a guarantor, the Group recog-\nnizes in other liabilities, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for \nthe fair value of the obligations undertaken in issuing such a guar-\nantee, including its ongoing obligation to perform over the term of \nthe guarantee in the event that certain events or conditions occur.\n\nPension and other post-retirement benefits\nCredit Suisse sponsors a number of post-employment benefit \nplans for its employees worldwide, which include defined benefit \npension plans and other post-employment benefits. The major \nplans are located in Switzerland, the UK and the US.\n\nfuture changes in the interest rate environment based on the yield \ncurve used for the discount rate.\n\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is deter-\nmined on a plan-by-plan basis, taking into account asset alloca-\ntion, historical rate of return, benchmark indices for similar-type \npension plan assets, long-term expectations of future returns and \ninvestment strategy.\n\nMortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables \nand standard models and methodologies for projecting future \nimprovements to mortality as developed and published by external \nindependent actuarial societies and actuarial organizations.\n\nHealth care cost trend rates are determined by reviewing external \ndata and the Group\xe2\x80\x99s own historical trends for health care costs.\n\nThe funded status of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s defined benefit post-retirement \nand pension plans is recognized in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe Group uses the projected unit credit actuarial method to deter-\nmine the present value of its projected benefit obligations (PBO) \nand the current and past service costs or credits related to its \ndefined benefit and other post-retirement benefit plans. The mea-\nsurement date used to perform the actuarial valuation is Decem-\nber\xc2\xa031 and is performed by independent qualified actuaries.\n\nActuarial gains and losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the \nPBO or the market value of plan assets and unrecognized prior \nservice costs or credits are amortized to net periodic pension and \nother post-retirement benefit costs on a straight-line basis over \nthe average remaining service life of active employees expected \nto receive benefits.\n\nCertain key assumptions are used in performing the actuarial val-\nuations. These assumptions must be made concerning the future \nevents that will determine the amount and timing of the benefit \npayments and thus require significant judgment and estimates \nby Group management. This includes making assumptions with \nregard to discount rates, salary increases, interest rate on savings \nbalances, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and \nmortality (future life expectancy).\n\nThe assumed discount rates reflect the rates at which the pension \nbenefits could be effectively settled. These rates are determined \nbased on yield curves, constructed from high-quality corporate \nbonds currently available and observable in the market and are \nexpected to be available during the period to maturity of the pen-\nsion benefits. In countries where there is no deep market in high-\nquality corporate bonds with longer durations, the best available \nmarket information, including governmental bond yields and risk \npremiums, is used to construct the yield curve.\n\nSalary increases are determined by reviewing historical practice \nand external market data as well as considering internal projections.\n\nThe interest rate on savings balances is applicable only to the \nCredit Suisse Swiss pension plan (Swiss pension plan). The \nBoard of Trustees of the Swiss pension plan sets the interest rate \nto be applied on the accumulated savings balance on an annual \nbasis. Credit Suisse estimates the future interest rate on savings \nbalances, taking into consideration actions and rates approved \nby the Board of Trustees of the Swiss pension plan and expected \n\nThe Group records pension expense for defined contribution \nplans when the employee renders service to the company, essen-\ntially coinciding with the cash contributions to the plans.\n\nShare-based compensation\n\nFor all share-based awards granted to employees, compensation \nexpense is measured at grant date or modification date based on \nthe fair value of the number of awards for which the requisite ser-\nvice is expected to be rendered and is recognized in the consoli-\ndated statements of operations over the required service period.\n\nThe incremental tax effects of the difference between the com-\npensation expense recorded in the US GAAP accounts and the \ntax deduction received, are recorded in the income statement at \nthe point in time the deduction for tax purposes is recorded.\n\nCompensation expense for share-based awards that vest in their \nentirety at the end of the vesting period (cliff vesting) and awards \nthat vest in annual installments (graded vesting), which only con-\ntain a service condition that affects vesting, is recognized on a \nstraight-line basis over the service period for the entire award. \nHowever, if awards with graded vesting contain a performance \ncondition, then each installment is expensed as if it were a sepa-\nrate award (\xe2\x80\x9cfront-loaded\xe2\x80\x9d expense recognition). Furthermore, \nrecognition of compensation expense is accelerated to the date \nan employee becomes eligible for retirement.\n\nPerformance share awards contain a performance condition. In \nthe event of either a negative return on equity (ROE) of the Group \n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n283\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nor a divisional loss, any outstanding performance share awards will \nbe subject to a reduction. The amount of compensation expense \nrecorded includes an estimate of any expected reductions. For \neach reporting period after the grant date, the expected number \nof shares to be ultimately delivered upon vesting is reassessed \nand reflected as an adjustment to the cumulative compensation \nexpense recorded in the income statement. The basis for the ROE \ncalculation may vary from year to year, depending on the Compen-\nsation Committee\xe2\x80\x99s determination for the year in which the perfor-\nmance shares are granted.\n\nCertain employees own equity interests in the form of carried \ninterests in certain funds managed by the Group. Expenses rec-\nognized under these ownership interests are reflected in the con-\nsolidated statements of operations in compensation and benefits.\n\nOwn shares, own bonds and financial instruments \non own shares\n\nThe Group may buy and sell own shares, own bonds and financial \ninstruments on own shares within its normal trading and market-\nmaking activities. In addition, the Group may hold its own shares \nto satisfy commitments arising from employee share-based com-\npensation awards. Own shares are recorded at cost and reported \nas treasury shares, resulting in a reduction to total sharehold-\ners\xe2\x80\x99 equity. Financial instruments on own shares are recorded \nas assets or liabilities or as equity when the criteria for equity \nclassification are met. Dividends received by subsidiaries on \nown shares and unrealized and realized gains and losses on own \nshares classified in total shareholders\xe2\x80\x99 equity are excluded from \nthe consolidated statements of operations.\n\nAny holdings of bonds issued by any Group entity are eliminated \nin the consolidated financial statements.\n\nNet interest income\n\nInterest income and interest expense arising from interest-bearing \nassets and liabilities other than those carried at fair value or the \nlower of cost or market are accrued, and any related net deferred \npremiums, discounts, origination fees or costs are amortized as \nan adjustment to the yield over the life of the related asset and lia-\nbility. Interest from debt securities and dividends on equity securi-\nties carried as trading assets and trading liabilities are recorded in \ninterest and dividend income.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cLoans\xe2\x80\x9d for further information on interest on loans.\n\nCommissions and fees\n\nCommissions and fees include revenue from contracts with cus-\ntomers. The Group recognizes revenue when it satisfies a con-\ntractual performance obligation. The Group satisfies a perfor-\nmance obligation when control of the underlying good or services \nrelated to the performance obligation is transferred to the cus-\ntomer. Control is the ability to direct the use of, and obtain sub-\nstantially all of the remaining benefits from, the good or service. \nThe Group must determine whether control of a good or service \nis transferred over time. If so, the related revenue is recognized \nover time as the good or service is transferred to the customer. If \nnot, control of the good or service is transferred at a point in time. \nThe performance obligations are typically satisfied as the ser-\nvices in the contract are rendered. Revenue is measured based \non the consideration specified in a contract with a customer, and \nexcludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The \ntransaction price can be a fixed amount or can vary because of \nperformance bonuses or other similar items. Variable consider-\nation is only included in the transaction price once it is probable \nthat a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue \nrecognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with \nthe amount of variable consideration is subsequently resolved. \nGenerally, no significant judgement is required with respect to \nrecording variable consideration.\n\nWhen another party is involved in providing goods or services \nto a customer, the Group must determine whether the nature of \nits promise is a performance obligation to provide the specified \ngoods or services itself (that is, the Group is a principal) or to \narrange for those goods or services to be provided by the other \nparty (that is, the Group is an agent). The Group determines \nwhether it is a principal or an agent for each specified good or \nservice promised to the customer. Gross presentation (revenue on \nthe revenue line and expense on the expense line) is appropriate \nwhen the Group acts as principal in a transaction. Conversely, net \npresentation (revenue and expenses reported net) is appropriate \nwhen the Group acts as an agent in the transaction.\n\nTransaction-related expenses are expensed as incurred. Industry \nspecific guidance for the deferral of underwriting expenses allows \nthe deferral and recognition of the underwriting expenses along \nwith the underwriting revenue.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cNote\xc2\xa014 \xe2\x80\x93 Revenue from contracts with customers\xe2\x80\x9d for further \n\ninformation.\n\n2  Recently issued accounting standards\nRecently adopted accounting standards\n\nASC Topic 230 \xe2\x80\x93 Statement of Cash Flows\nIn November 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board \n(FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU)\xc2\xa02016-18, \n\n284\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRestricted Cash (a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues \nTask Force)\xe2\x80\x9d (ASU\xc2\xa02016-18), an update to Accounting Stan-\ndards Codification (ASC) Topic 230 \xe2\x80\x93 Statement of Cash Flows. \nASU\xc2\xa02016-18 required that cash amounts described as restricted \ncash and cash equivalents be included in cash and cash \n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nequivalents when reconciling total amounts in the statements of \ncash flows. ASU\xc2\xa02016-18 was required to be applied retrospec-\ntively to all periods presented beginning in the year of adoption. \nThe adoption of ASU\xc2\xa02016-18 on January 1, 2018 did not have \nan impact on the Group\xe2\x80\x99s financial position, results of operations \nand cash flows.\n\nIn August\xc2\xa02016, the FASB issued ASU\xc2\xa02016-15, \xe2\x80\x9cClassification \nof Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (a consensus of \nthe Emerging Issues Task Force)\xe2\x80\x9d (ASU\xc2\xa02016-15), an update to \nASC Topic\xc2\xa0230 \xe2\x80\x93 Statement of Cash Flows. The amendments in \nASU\xc2\xa02016-15 provided guidance regarding classification of cer-\ntain cash receipts and payments where diversity in practice was \nobserved. ASU\xc2\xa02016-15 was required to be applied retrospec-\ntively to all periods presented beginning in the year of adoption. \nThe adoption of ASU\xc2\xa02016-15 on January\xc2\xa01, 2018 did not have \na material impact on the Group\xe2\x80\x99s financial position, results of \noperations and cash flows and, as such, prior periods were not \nrestated.\n\nASC Topic 606 \xe2\x80\x93 Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nIn May\xc2\xa02014, the FASB issued ASU\xc2\xa02014-09, \xe2\x80\x9cRevenue from \nContracts with Customers\xe2\x80\x9d (ASU\xc2\xa02014-09), creating ASC \nTopic\xc2\xa0606 \xe2\x80\x93 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and super-\nseding ASC Topic\xc2\xa0605 \xe2\x80\x93 Revenue Recognition. The core prin-\nciple of the guidance was that an entity recognizes revenue to \ndepict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers \nin an amount that reflected the consideration to which the entity \nexpected to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. \nASU\xc2\xa02014-09 outlined key steps that an entity should follow to \nachieve the core principle. ASU\xc2\xa02014-09 also included disclosure \nrequirements that enabled users of the financial statements to \nunderstand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue \nand cash flows arising from contracts with customers.\n\nASU\xc2\xa02014-09 and its subsequent amendments were effective for \nthe annual reporting period beginning after December\xc2\xa015, 2017, \nincluding interim reporting periods within that reporting period. \nEarly adoption was permitted for annual reporting periods begin-\nning after December\xc2\xa015, 2016, including interim reporting periods \nwithin that reporting period.\n\nThe Group established a cross-functional implementation team \nand governance structure for the project. The Group\xe2\x80\x99s imple-\nmentation efforts included the identification of revenue and costs \nwithin the scope of the guidance, as well as the evaluation of \nrevenue contracts under the new guidance and related account-\ning policies. The guidance did not apply to revenue associated \nwith financial instruments, including loans and securities that are \naccounted for under other US GAAP guidance.\n\nAdditionally, the new revenue recognition criteria required the \nGroup to present underwriting revenue, reimbursed expenses \nin fund management and in investment banking advisory, gross \nof offsetting expenses in contrast to prior periods in which the \nfinancial statements presented these amounts net of offsetting \nexpenses. Furthermore, with the adoption of ASU\xc2\xa02014-09, the \nbrokerage, clearing and exchange expenses, which are incurred \nwhen acting as an agent on behalf of clients buying or selling \nexchange-traded cash securities, exchange-traded derivatives or \ncentrally cleared OTC derivatives, are offset against the commis-\nsion income.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cNote 14 \xe2\x80\x93 Revenue from contracts with customers\xe2\x80\x9d for further \n\ninformation.\n\nASC Topic 715 \xe2\x80\x93 Compensation \xe2\x80\x93 Retirement Benefits\nIn March\xc2\xa02017, the FASB issued ASU\xc2\xa02017-07, \xe2\x80\x9cImproving the \nPresentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic \nPostretirement Benefit Cost\xe2\x80\x9d (ASU\xc2\xa02017-07), an update to ASC \nTopic\xc2\xa0715 \xe2\x80\x93 Compensation \xe2\x80\x93 Retirement Benefits. The amend-\nments in ASU\xc2\xa02017-07 required that the service cost compo-\nnent of the net periodic benefit cost be presented in the same \nincome statement line item(s) as other employee compensation \ncosts arising from services rendered during the period. Other \ncomponents of the net periodic benefit cost should be reported \nseparately from the line item(s) that included the service cost and \noutside of any subtotal of operating income. ASU\xc2\xa02017-07 was \nrequired to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented \nbeginning in the year of adoption. The adoption of ASU\xc2\xa02017-07 \non January\xc2\xa01, 2018 resulted in a restatement that, upon adoption, \nincreased compensation and benefits expenses and decreased \ngeneral and administrative expenses by CHF\xc2\xa0190 million and \nCHF\xc2\xa080 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively.\n\nASC Topic 820 \xe2\x80\x93 Fair Value Measurement\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU\xc2\xa02018-13, \xe2\x80\x9cDisclo-\nsure Framework \xe2\x80\x93 Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for \nFair Value Measurement\xe2\x80\x9d (ASU\xc2\xa02018-13), an update to ASC \nTopic\xc2\xa0820 \xe2\x80\x93 Fair Value Measurement. The amendments in \nASU\xc2\xa02018-13 remove, modify and add certain disclosure require-\nments in ASC Topic\xc2\xa0820, Fair Value Measurement. ASU\xc2\xa02018-13 \nis effective for annual reporting periods beginning after Decem-\nber\xc2\xa015, 2019 and for the interim periods within those annual \nreporting periods. Early adoption is permitted, including in an \ninterim period, for any eliminated or modified disclosure require-\nments. The Group early adopted the provisions for removing and \nmodifying certain disclosures upon issuance of ASU\xc2\xa02018-13. \nAs these amendments relate to disclosures, the adoption did not \nhave an impact on the Group\xe2\x80\x99s financial position, results of opera-\ntions or cash flows. The Group is currently evaluating the impact \nof the adoption of the remaining amendments in ASU\xc2\xa02018-13.\n\nThe Group adopted ASU\xc2\xa02014-09 on January\xc2\xa01, 2018 using the \nmodified retrospective approach with a transition adjustment rec-\nognized in retained earnings without restating comparatives. As a \nresult of adoption, there was a decrease in retained earnings, net \nof tax, of CHF\xc2\xa045 million due to a change in timing of the recog-\nnition of certain fees in investment banking and private banking.\n\nASC Topic 825 \xe2\x80\x93 Financial Instruments \xe2\x80\x93 Overall\nIn January\xc2\xa02016, the FASB issued ASU\xc2\xa02016-01, \xe2\x80\x9cRecognition \nand Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities\xe2\x80\x9d \n(ASU\xc2\xa02016-01), an update to ASC Topic\xc2\xa0825 \xe2\x80\x93 Financial Instru-\nments \xe2\x80\x93 Overall. The amendments in ASU\xc2\xa02016-01 addressed \ncertain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and \n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n285\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\ndisclosure of financial instruments. The amendments primarily \naffected the accounting for equity investments, financial liabili-\nties under the fair value option and the presentation and disclo-\nsure requirements for financial instruments. Early adoption of \nthe full standard was not permitted; however, certain sections \nof ASU\xc2\xa02016-01 relating to fair value option-elected financial \nliabilities could be early adopted in isolation. The amendments \nto ASU\xc2\xa02016-01 required the changes in fair value relating to \ninstrument-specific credit risk of fair value option elected financial \nliabilities to be presented separately in AOCI. The Group early \nadopted these sections of the update on January\xc2\xa01, 2016. As a \nresult of the adoption, the Group reclassified CHF\xc2\xa0475 million, \nnet of tax, from retained earnings to AOCI. The adoption of the \nremaining amendments to ASU\xc2\xa02016-01 on January\xc2\xa01, 2018 \nresulted in a reclassification of unrealized gains and losses pre-\nviously reported in AOCI for available-for-sale equity securities \nto retained earnings of CHF\xc2\xa021 million, net of tax. ASU\xc2\xa02016-\n01 also required that certain equity instruments without read-\nily determinable fair value be measured at fair value, excluding \ninstances in which measurement alternative is applied; however, \nthis requirement did not have a material impact on the Group\xe2\x80\x99s \nfinancial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n\nits credit loss estimates. ASU\xc2\xa02016-13 requires enhanced disclo-\nsures to help investors and other financial statement users to better \nunderstand significant estimates and judgments used in estimating \ncredit losses, as well as the credit quality and underwriting stan-\ndards of an organization\xe2\x80\x99s portfolio. As the Group is a US Securi-\nties and Exchange Commission (SEC) filer, ASU\xc2\xa02016-13 and its \nsubsequent amendment are effective for annual reporting periods \nbeginning after December\xc2\xa015, 2019, including interim periods \nwithin those annual reporting periods. Early adoption is permitted \nfor annual reporting periods, including interim periods within those \nannual reporting periods, beginning after December\xc2\xa015, 2018; \nhowever, the Group does not intend to early adopt ASU\xc2\xa02016-13.\n\nThe Group has established a cross-functional implementation \nteam and governance structure for the project. The Group has \ndecided on a current expected credit loss (CECL) methodology \nand continues to adjust for key interpretive issues while monitor-\ning the FASB\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing accounting standards development. Fur-\nthermore, the Group will continue to monitor the scope assess-\nment, as a basis to determine the requirements and data sourcing \nof the CECL models, and to design, build and test the models \nuntil the effective date.\n\nStandards to be adopted in future periods\n\nASC Topic 220 \xe2\x80\x93 Income Statements \xe2\x80\x93 Reporting Compre-\nhensive Income\nIn January 2018, the FASB issued ASU\xc2\xa02018-02, \xe2\x80\x9cReclassifi-\ncation of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Com-\nprehensive Income\xe2\x80\x9d (ASU\xc2\xa02018-02), an update to ASC\xc2\xa0Topic \n220 \xe2\x80\x93 Income Statement \xe2\x80\x93 Reporting Comprehensive Income. \nThe amendments in ASU\xc2\xa02018-02 allow a reclassification from \nAOCI to retained earnings for the stranded tax effects resulting \nfrom the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. ASU\xc2\xa02018-02 is effec-\ntive for annual reporting periods and interim periods within those \nperiods beginning after December\xc2\xa015, 2018. Early adoption was \npermitted. The adoption of ASU\xc2\xa02018-02 on January\xc2\xa01, 2019 \nresulted in a net increase in retained earnings of CHF\xc2\xa064 million \nas a result of the reclassification from AOCI to retained earn-\nings, which was the result of the re-measurement of deferred tax \nassets and liabilities associated with the change in tax rates.\n\nASC Topic 326 \xe2\x80\x93 Financial Instruments \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Losses\nIn June\xc2\xa02016, the FASB issued ASU\xc2\xa02016-13, \xe2\x80\x9cMeasurement \nof Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\xe2\x80\x9d (ASU\xc2\xa02016-13), cre-\nating ASC Topic\xc2\xa0326 \xe2\x80\x93 Financial Instruments \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Losses. \nASU\xc2\xa02016-13 is intended to improve financial reporting by requiring \ntimelier recording of credit losses on financial assets measured at \namortized cost basis including, but not limited to loans, net invest-\nments in leases recognized as lessor and off-balance sheet credit \nexposures. ASU\xc2\xa02016-13 eliminates the probable initial recognition \nthreshold under the current incurred loss methodology for recog-\nnizing credit losses. Instead, ASU\xc2\xa02016-13 requires the measure-\nment of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the \nreporting date based on historical experience, current conditions \nand reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Group will incorpo-\nrate forward-looking information and macroeconomic factors into \n\nThe Group expects that the new CECL methodology would gen-\nerally result in increased and more volatile allowance for loan \nlosses. The main impact drivers include:\np  the remaining life of the loans measured at amortized cost and \n\nthe off-balance sheet credit exposures at the adoption date \nand subsequent reporting dates because of the new require-\nment to measure lifetime expected credit losses;\n\np  the state of the economy at the adoption date and subsequent \nreporting dates because of the new requirement to incorporate \nreasonable and supportable forward looking information and \nmacroeconomic factors; and\n\np  the credit quality of the loans measured at amortized cost and \n\nthe off-balance sheet credit exposures at the adoption date \nand subsequent reporting dates.\n\nUpon adoption of the standard, the Group expects a cumula-\ntive adjustment to be posted to retained earnings for any changes \nin credit loss allowances. As the implementation progresses, the \nGroup will continue to evaluate the extent of the impact of the \nadoption of ASU\xc2\xa02016-13 and its subsequent amendment on the \nGroup\xe2\x80\x99s financial position, results of operations, cash flows and \nrelated disclosures.\n\nASC Topic 350 \xe2\x80\x93 Intangibles \xe2\x80\x93 Goodwill and Other\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU\xc2\xa02018-15, \xe2\x80\x9cCustomer\xe2\x80\x99s \nAccounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Com-\nputing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract\xe2\x80\x9d (ASU\xc2\xa02018-15), \nan update to ASC Subtopic 350-40 \xe2\x80\x93 Intangibles \xe2\x80\x93 Goodwill and \nOther \xe2\x80\x93 Internal-Use Software. The amendments in ASU\xc2\xa02018-\n15 align the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs \nincurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with \nthe requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to \ndevelop or obtain internal-use software. ASU\xc2\xa02018-15 is effective \nfor annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, \n\n286\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nincluding interim periods within those annual reporting periods \nand can be applied either retrospectively or prospectively. Early \nadoption, including adoption in an interim period, is permitted. \nThe Group elected to early adopt ASU\xc2\xa02018-15 prospectively on \nJanuary\xc2\xa01, 2019. The adoption of ASU\xc2\xa02018-15 did not have a \nmaterial impact on the Group\xe2\x80\x99s financial position, results of opera-\ntions or cash flows.\n\nrequirements of hedge accounting activities. ASU\xc2\xa02017-12 is \neffective for annual reporting periods beginning after Decem-\nber\xc2\xa015, 2018, and for the interim periods within those annual \nreporting periods. Early adoption, including adoption in an interim \nperiod, was permitted. The adoption of ASU\xc2\xa02017-12 on Janu-\nary\xc2\xa01, 2019 did not have a material impact on the Group\xe2\x80\x99s finan-\ncial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nASC Topic 715 \xe2\x80\x93 Compensation \xe2\x80\x93 Retirement Benefits\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU\xc2\xa02018-14, \xe2\x80\x9cChanges \nto the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans\xe2\x80\x9d \n(ASU\xc2\xa02018-14), an update to ASC Topic\xc2\xa0715 \xe2\x80\x93 Compensation\xe2\x80\x94\nRetirement Benefits\xe2\x80\x94Defined Benefit Plans\xe2\x80\x94General (Sub-\ntopic\xc2\xa0715-20): Disclosure Framework. ASU\xc2\xa02018-14 modifies \nthe disclosure framework to improve disclosure requirements for \nemployers that sponsor defined benefit pension or other post-\nretirement plans. ASU\xc2\xa02018-14 is effective for annual reporting \nperiods ending after December\xc2\xa015, 2020, with early adoption \npermitted. ASU\xc2\xa02018-14 should be applied on a retrospective \napproach for all periods presented. As these amendments relate \nonly to disclosures, there will be no impact from the adoption of \nASU\xc2\xa02018-14 on the Group\xe2\x80\x99s financial position, results of opera-\ntions or cash flows.\n\nASC Topic 810 \xe2\x80\x93 Consolidation\nIn October 2018, the FASB issued ASU\xc2\xa02018-17, \xe2\x80\x9cTargeted \nImprovements to Related Party guidance for Variable Interest \nEntities\xe2\x80\x9d (ASU\xc2\xa02018-17), an update to ASC Topic 810 \xe2\x80\x93 Consoli-\ndation. ASU\xc2\xa02018-17 amended the variable interest entity guid-\nance to require an entity to consider a decision maker\xe2\x80\x99s indirect \ninterests held through related parties under common control on \na proportional basis when determining whether decision-making \nfees are variable interests. ASU\xc2\xa02018-17 is effective for annual \nreporting periods beginning after December\xc2\xa015, 2019 and for the \ninterim periods within those annual reporting periods. Early adop-\ntion is permitted. ASU\xc2\xa02018-17 should be applied retrospectively \nwith a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings at the \nbeginning of the earliest period presented. The Group is currently \nevaluating the impact of the adoption of ASU\xc2\xa02018-17 on the \nGroup\xe2\x80\x99s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nASC Topic 815 \xe2\x80\x93 Derivatives and Hedging\nIn August\xc2\xa02017, the FASB issued ASU\xc2\xa02017-12, \xe2\x80\x9cTargeted \nImprovements to Accounting for Hedging Activities\xe2\x80\x9d (ASU\xc2\xa02017-\n12), an update to ASC\xc2\xa0Topic\xc2\xa0815 \xe2\x80\x93 Derivatives and Hedging. \nASU\xc2\xa02017-12 makes changes to the hedge accounting model \nintended to facilitate financial reporting that more closely reflects \nan entity\xe2\x80\x99s risk management activities and to simplify application \nof hedge accounting. The amendments in ASU\xc2\xa02017-12 provide \nmore hedging strategies that will be eligible for hedge accounting, \nease the documentation and effectiveness assessment require-\nments and result in changes to the presentation and disclosure \n\nIn October\xc2\xa02018, the FASB issued ASU\xc2\xa02018-16, \xe2\x80\x9cInclu-\nsion of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Over-\nnight Index Swap (OIS) Rate as a Benchmark Interest Rate for \nHedge Accounting Purposes\xe2\x80\x9d (ASU\xc2\xa02018-16), an update to ASC \nTopic\xc2\xa0815 \xe2\x80\x93 Derivatives and Hedging. ASU\xc2\xa02018-16 permits \nthe use of the OIS rate based on the SOFR as a US benchmark \ninterest rate for hedge accounting purposes and was effective for \nthe Group on January\xc2\xa01, 2019. The adoption of ASU\xc2\xa02018-16 on \nJanuary\xc2\xa01, 2019 did not impact the Group\xe2\x80\x99s existing hedges.\n\nASC Topic 842 \xe2\x80\x93 Leases\nIn February\xc2\xa02016, the FASB issued ASU\xc2\xa02016-02, \xe2\x80\x9cLeases\xe2\x80\x9d \n(ASU\xc2\xa02016-02), creating ASC Topic\xc2\xa0842 \xe2\x80\x93 Leases and supersed-\ning ASC Topic\xc2\xa0840 \xe2\x80\x93 Leases. ASU\xc2\xa02016-02 sets out the princi-\nples for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure \nof leases for both lessees and lessors. ASU\xc2\xa02016-02 also includes \ndisclosure requirements to provide more information about the \namount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. \nLessor accounting is substantially unchanged compared to the \ncurrent accounting guidance. Under the current lessee account-\ning model the Group is required to distinguish between finance \nleases, which are recognized on the balance sheet, and operating \nleases, which are not. ASU\xc2\xa02016-02 requires lessees to present \na right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability on the bal-\nance sheet irrespective of the lease classification. ASU\xc2\xa02016-02 \nand its subsequent amendments are effective for annual reporting \nperiods beginning after December\xc2\xa015, 2018, and for the interim \nperiods within those annual reporting periods. Early adoption was \npermitted.\n\nThe Group adopted ASU\xc2\xa02016-02 on January\xc2\xa01, 2019 using the \nmodified retrospective approach, with a transition adjustment rec-\nognized in retained earnings without restating comparatives. The \nGroup elected the use of the package of practical expedients and \nthe practical expedient to use hindsight.\n\nAs a result of adoption, the Group recognized lease liabilities and \nrelated right-of-use assets of approximately CHF\xc2\xa03.5 billion and \nCHF\xc2\xa03.3 billion, respectively. In addition, the Group recognized \nan increase in retained earnings of approximately CHF\xc2\xa00.2 billion, \nnet of tax, which included both the release of previously deferred \ngains on sale lease-back transactions and previously unrecognized \nimpairment losses.\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n287\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\n3   Business developments, significant shareholders and subsequent \n\nevents\n\nThe Group\xe2\x80\x99s significant business developments for 2018 as well \nas the Group\xe2\x80\x99s significant shareholders are discussed below.\n\nSignificant shareholders\n\nBusiness developments\n\nThere were no significant business developments for the Group in \n2018.\n\nSignificant shareholders registered in the share register\nThe following table includes significant shareholders (including \nnominees) with holdings in Group shares of at least 5% of the \nvoting rights, which were registered in the share register as of \nDecember\xc2\xa031, 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n\nSignificant shareholders registered in the share register\nend of\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\n       \n\nNumber   Total nominal   \nof shares   \nvalue   \n(million)   (CHF million)   \n\n2018   \nShare-   \nholding   \n(%)   \n\n       \n\nNumber   Total nominal   \nof shares   \nvalue   \n(million)   (CHF million)   \n\n2017 \nShare- \nholding \n(%) \n\nDirect shareholders\xc2\xa01\nChase Nominees Ltd.\xc2\xa02 \nNortrust Nominees Ltd.\xc2\xa02 \n\n388   \n149   \n\n16   \n6   \n\n15.19   \n5.84   \n\n329   \n140   \n\n13   \n6   \n\n12.88 \n5.49 \n\n1 As registered in the share register of the Group on December 31 of the reporting period; includes shareholders registered as nominees.\n2 Nominee holdings exceeding 2% are registered with a right to vote only if the nominee confirms that no individual shareholder holds more than 0.5% of the outstanding share capital or if \n\nthe nominee discloses the identity of any beneficial owner holding more than 0.5% of the outstanding capital.\n\nInformation received from shareholders not registered in \nthe share register\nIn addition to the shareholdings registered in the share register of \nthe Group, the Group has obtained and reported to the SIX Swiss \nExchange (SIX) information from its shareholders in accordance \nwith the notification requirements of the Swiss Federal Act on \nFinancial Market Infrastructures and Market Conduct in Securi-\nties and Derivatives Trading.

The following \nshareholder notifications relate to registered voting rights exceed-\ning 5% of all voting rights, which are subject to disclosure in the \nnotes to the financial statements in accordance with the Swiss \nCode of Obligations.\n\nIn a disclosure notification that the Group published on Novem-\nber\xc2\xa09, 2013, the Group was notified that as of November\xc2\xa04, \n2013, Harris Associates L.P. held 81.5\xc2\xa0million shares, or 5.17% \nof the voting rights, of the registered Group shares issued as of \nthe date of the notified transaction. No further disclosure noti-\nfication has been received from Harris Associates L.P. relating \nto holdings of registered Group shares since 2013.

As a result, the Group increased its 2018 \nlitigation provision by CHF\xc2\xa033 million in the Corporate & Institu-\ntional Banking business within the Swiss Universal Bank division \nand decreased its estimate of the aggregate range of reasonably \npossible losses not covered by existing provisions from zero to \nCHF\xc2\xa01.5 billion to zero to CHF\xc2\xa01.4 billion.\n\n288\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\n4  Segment information\n\nThe Group is a global financial services company domiciled in \nSwitzerland and serves its clients through three regionally focused \ndivisions: Swiss Universal Bank, International Wealth Manage-\nment and Asia Pacific. These regional businesses are supported \nby two other divisions specialized in investment banking capabili-\nties: Global Markets and Investment Banking & Capital Markets. \nAs of December 31, 2018, Strategic Resolution Unit consolidates \nthe remaining portfolios from the former non-strategic units plus \nadditional businesses and positions that do not fit with the strate-\ngic direction. \n\nThe segment information reflects the Group\xe2\x80\x99s six reportable seg-\nments, which are managed and reported on a pre-tax basis, as \nfollows:\np  The Swiss Universal Bank division offers comprehen-\n\nsive advice and a wide range of financial solutions to private, \ncorporate and institutional clients primarily domiciled in the \nGroup\xe2\x80\x99s home market Switzerland. The Private Clients busi-\nness has a leading franchise in the Group\xe2\x80\x99s home market and \nserves ultra-high-net-worth individual, high-net-worth indi-\nvidual, affluent and retail clients. The Corporate & Institutional \nClients business serves large corporate clients, small and \nmedium-sized enterprises, institutional clients, external asset \nmanagers, financial institutions and commodity traders.\n\np  The International Wealth Management division through \nits Private Banking business offers comprehensive advisory \nservices and tailored investment and financing solutions to \nwealthy private clients and external asset managers in Europe, \nthe Middle East, Africa and Latin America. The Asset Man-\nagement business offers investment solutions and services \nglobally to a broad range of clients, including pension funds, \ngovernments, foundations and endowments, corporations and \nindividuals.\n\np  In the Asia Pacific division, the wealth management, financ-\n\ning and underwriting and advisory teams work closely together \nto deliver integrated advisory services and solutions to target \nultra-high-net-worth, entrepreneur and corporate clients. The \nWealth Management & Connected business combines activi-\nties in wealth management with the financing, underwriting \nand advisory activities. The Markets business represents the \nGroup\xe2\x80\x99s equities and fixed income sales and trading busi-\nnesses, which support the wealth management activities, but \nalso deals extensively with a broader range of institutional \nclients. \n\np  The Global Markets division offers a broad range of financial \n\nproducts and services to client-driven businesses and also \nsupports the Group\xe2\x80\x99s global wealth management businesses \nand their clients. The suite of products and services includes \nglobal securities sales, trading and execution, prime broker-\nage and comprehensive investment research. Clients include \nfinancial institutions, corporations, governments, institutional \ninvestors, such as pension funds and hedge funds, and private \nindividuals around the world.\n\np  The Investment Banking & Capital Markets division offers \na broad range of investment banking services to corporations, \n\nfinancial institutions, financial sponsors and ultra-high-net-\nworth individuals and sovereign clients. The range of products \nand services includes advisory services related to mergers and \nacquisitions, divestitures, takeover defense mandates, busi-\nness restructurings and spin-offs. The division also engages in \ndebt and equity underwriting of public securities offerings and \nprivate placements.\n\np  The Strategic Resolution Unit was created to facilitate the \nimmediate right-sizing of the business divisions from a capital \nperspective and included remaining portfolios from the for-\nmer non-strategic units plus transfers of additional exposures \nfrom the business divisions. The Strategic Resolution Unit also \nincluded noncontrolling interest-related revenues and expenses \nresulting from the consolidation of certain private equity funds \nand other entities in which the Group did not have a signifi-\ncant economic interest (SEI) in such revenues and expenses. \nThe consolidation of these entities did not affect net income \nattributable to shareholders as the amounts recorded in net \nrevenues and total operating expenses were offset by corre-\nsponding amounts reported as noncontrolling interests. Begin-\nning in 2019, the Strategic Resolution Unit has ceased to exist \nas a separate division of the Group. \n\nCorporate Center includes parent company operations such as \nGroup financing, expenses for projects sponsored by the Group \nand certain expenses that have not been allocated to the seg-\nments. In addition, the Corporate Center includes consolidation \nand elimination adjustments required to eliminate intercompany \nrevenues and expenses.\n\nRevenue sharing and cost allocation\n\nResponsibility for each product is allocated to a specific segment, \nwhich records all related revenues and expenses. Revenue-\nsharing and service level agreements govern the compensation \nreceived by one segment for generating revenue or providing \nservices on behalf of another. These agreements are negotiated \nperiodically by the relevant segments on a product-by-product \nbasis. The aim of revenue-sharing and service level agree-\nments is to reflect the pricing structure of unrelated third-party \ntransactions.\n\nCorporate services and business support in finance, operations, \nhuman resources, legal, compliance, risk management and IT \nare provided by corporate functions, and the related costs are \nallocated to the segments and Corporate Center based on their \nrequirements and other relevant measures.\n\nFunding\n\nThe Group centrally manages its funding activities. New secu-\nrities for funding and capital purposes are issued primarily by \nCredit Suisse AG, the direct bank subsidiary of the Group (the \nBank).

Capital is distributed \nto the segments considering factors such as regulatory capital \nrequirements, utilized economic capital and the historic and future \npotential return on capital. \n\nTransfer pricing, using market rates, is used to record net rev-\nenues and expenses in each of the segments for this capital and \nfunding. The Group\xe2\x80\x99s funds transfer pricing system is designed to \nallocate funding costs to its businesses in a way that incentivizes \ntheir efficient use of funding. The Group\xe2\x80\x99s funds transfer pricing \nsystem is an essential tool that allocates to the businesses the \nshort-term and long-term costs of funding their balance sheet \nusages and off-balance sheet contingencies. The funds transfer \npricing framework ensures the full funding costs allocation under \nnormal business conditions, but it is of even greater importance \nin a stressed capital markets environment where raising funds \nis more challenging and expensive. Under this framework, the \nGroup\xe2\x80\x99s businesses are also credited to the extent they provide \nlong-term stable funding.\n\nNet revenues and income/(loss) before taxes\nin\xc2\xa0 \n\n2018   \n\n2017   \n\n2016 \n\n \n\nNet revenues (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \nSwiss Universal Bank\xc2\xa0 \nInternational Wealth Management\xc2\xa0 \nAsia Pacific\xc2\xa0 \nGlobal Markets\xc2\xa0 \nInvestment Banking & Capital Markets\xc2\xa0 \nStrategic Resolution Unit\xc2\xa0 \nCorporate Center\xc2\xa0 \nNet revenues\xc2\xa0 \n\nIncome/(loss) before taxes (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \n \nSwiss Universal Bank\xc2\xa0 \nInternational Wealth Management\xc2\xa0 \nAsia Pacific\xc2\xa0 \nGlobal Markets\xc2\xa0 \nInvestment Banking & Capital Markets\xc2\xa0 \nStrategic Resolution Unit\xc2\xa0 \nCorporate Center\xc2\xa0 \nIncome/(loss) before taxes\xc2\xa0 \n\n \n\n \n\n5,564   \n5,414   \n3,393   \n4,980   \n2,177   \n(708)   \n100   \n20,920   \n\n2,125   \n1,705   \n664   \n154   \n344   \n(1,381)   \n(239)   \n3,372   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n5,396   \n5,111   \n3,504   \n5,551   \n2,139   \n(886)   \n85   \n20,900   \n\n1,765   \n1,351   \n729   \n450   \n369   \n(2,135)   \n(736)   \n1,793   \n\n \n\n \n\n5,759 \n4,698 \n3,597 \n5,497 \n1,972 \n(1,271) \n71 \n20,323 \n\n2,025 \n1,121 \n725 \n48 \n261 \n(5,759) \n(687) \n(2,266) \n\n290\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\n5  Net interest income\n\n6  Commissions and fees\n\nin\xc2\xa0 \n\n2018   \n\n2017   \n\n2016 \n\nin\xc2\xa0 \n\nCommissions and fees (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \n \nLending business\xc2\xa0 \nInvestment and portfolio management\xc2\xa0 \nOther securities business\xc2\xa0 \nFiduciary business\xc2\xa0 \nUnderwriting\xc2\xa0 \nBrokerage\xc2\xa0 \nUnderwriting and brokerage\xc2\xa0 \nOther services\xc2\xa0 \nCommissions and fees\xc2\xa0 \n\n2018   \n\n2017   \n\n2016 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1,931   \n3,582   \n48   \n3,630   \n1,718   \n2,813   \n4,531   \n1,798   \n11,890   \n\n1,839   \n3,494   \n46   \n3,540   \n1,806   \n3,004   \n4,810   \n1,628   \n11,817   \n\n1,818 \n3,209 \n46 \n3,255 \n1,364 \n3,028 \n4,392 \n1,627 \n11,092 \n\n \n\nNet interest income (CHF million) \n \nLoans\xc2\xa0 \nInvestment securities\xc2\xa0 \nTrading assets\xc2\xa0 \nCentral bank funds sold, securities \xc2\xa0 \npurchased under resale agreements \xc2\xa0 \nand securities borrowing transactions\xc2\xa0 \nOther\xc2\xa0 \nInterest and dividend income\xc2\xa0 \nDeposits\xc2\xa0 \nShort-term borrowings\xc2\xa0 \nTrading liabilities\xc2\xa0 \nCentral bank funds purchased, securities \xc2\xa0 \nsold under repurchase agreements and \xc2\xa0 \nsecurities lending transactions\xc2\xa0 \nLong-term debt\xc2\xa0 \nOther\xc2\xa0 \nInterest expense\xc2\xa0 \nNet interest income\xc2\xa0 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n6,770   \n80   \n7,131   \n   \n   \n2,856   \n2,776   \n19,613   \n(2,287)   \n(359)   \n(3,453)   \n   \n   \n(1,877)   \n(3,816)   \n(812)   \n(12,604)   \n7,009   \n\n5,979   \n47   \n6,697   \n   \n   \n2,515   \n1,819   \n17,057   \n(1,354)   \n(166)   \n(3,542)   \n   \n   \n(1,284)   \n(3,722)   \n(432)   \n(10,500)   \n6,557   \n\n5,628 \n60 \n7,483 \n \n \n2,767 \n1,436 \n17,374 \n(1,043) \n(84) \n(3,602) \n \n \n(1,387) \n(3,494) \n(202) \n(9,812) \n7,562 \n\n7  Trading revenues\n\nin\xc2\xa0 \n\nTrading revenues (CHF million)\xc2\xa0   \nInterest rate products\xc2\xa0 \nForeign exchange products\xc2\xa0 \nEquity/index-related products\xc2\xa0 \nCredit products\xc2\xa0 \nCommodity and energy products\xc2\xa0 \nOther products\xc2\xa0 \nTrading revenues\xc2\xa0 \n\n2018   \n\n2017   \n\n2016 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n757   \n367   \n(307)   \n(97)   \n102   \n(198)   \n624   \n\n3,228   \n1,989   \n(2,888)   \n(1,096)   \n86   \n(2)   \n1,317   \n\n6,231 \n(2,529) \n(1,796) \n(2,124) \n177 \n354 \n313 \n\nRepresents revenues on a product basis which are not representative of business results \nwithin segments, as segment results utilize financial instruments across various product \ntypes.\nTrading revenues include revenues from trading financial assets \nand liabilities as follows:\np  Equities;\np  Commodities;\np  Listed and OTC derivatives;\np  Derivatives linked to funds of hedge funds and providing \n\nfinancing facilities to funds of hedge funds;\n\np  Market making in the government bond and associated OTC \n\nderivative swap markets;\n\np  Domestic, corporate and sovereign debt, convertible and non-\nconvertible preferred stock and short-term securities such as \nfloating rate notes and commercial paper (CP);\n\np  Market making and positioning in foreign exchange products;\np  Credit derivatives on investment grade and high yield credits;\np  Trading and securitizing all forms of securities that are based \n\non underlying pools of assets; and\n\np  Life settlement contracts.\n\nTrading revenues also include changes in the fair value of finan-\ncial assets and liabilities elected to fair value under US GAAP.

The Group uses an economic capital limit \nstructure to limit overall risk taking. The level of risk incurred by \nits divisions is further managed by a variety of factors and specific \nrisk constraints, including consolidated controls over trading expo-\nsures. Also, as part of its overall risk management, the Group holds \na portfolio of economic hedges. Hedges are impacted by market \nmovements, similar to trading securities, and may result in gains or \nlosses on the hedges which offset losses or gains on the portfolios \nthey were designed to economically hedge. The Group manages its \ntrading risk with regard to both market and credit risk. The Group \nuses market risk measurement and management methods capable \nof calculating comparable exposures across its many activities and \nemploys focused tools that can model unique characteristics of \ncertain instruments or portfolios.\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n291\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\n10  Compensation and benefits\n\nin\xc2\xa0 \n\n2018   \n\n2017   \n\n2016 \n\nCompensation and benefits (CHF million)\xc2\xa0   \n \nSalaries and variable compensation\xc2\xa0 \nSocial security\xc2\xa0 \nOther\xc2\xa01 \nCompensation and benefits\xc2\xa0 \n\n8,220   \n652   \n748   \n9,620   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n8,906   \n671   \n790   \n10,367   \n\n9,165 \n697 \n790 \n10,652 \n\n2018   \n\n2017   \n\n2016 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1 Includes pension-related expenses of CHF 411 million, CHF 432 million and CHF 464 \n\nmillion in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, relating to service costs for defined benefit \npension plans and employer contributions for defined contribution plans.\n\n \n\n11   General and administrative \n\nexpenses\n\nin\xc2\xa0 \n\n2018   \n\n2017   \n\n2016 \n\n \n\nGeneral and administrative expenses (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \n \n964   \nOccupancy expenses\xc2\xa0 \n1,174   \nIT, machinery, etc.\xc2\xa0 \n425   \nProvisions and losses\xc2\xa0 \nTravel and entertainment\xc2\xa0 \n338   \n1,803   \nProfessional services\xc2\xa0 \n   \nAmortization and impairment of\xc2\xa0 \nother intangible assets\xc2\xa0 \n9   \n1,085   \nOther\xc2\xa01 \n5,798   \nGeneral and administrative expenses\xc2\xa0 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n1,000   \n1,156   \n698   \n321   \n2,446   \n   \n9   \n1,015   \n6,645   \n\n1,004 \n1,166 \n3,009 \n328 \n2,984 \n \n8 \n1,191 \n9,690 \n\n1 Includes pension-related expenses/(credits) of CHF (208) million, CHF (190) million and \nCHF\xc2\xa0(80) million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, relating to certain components of \nnet periodic benefit costs for defined benefit plans.\n\nRestructuring expenses by type\nin\xc2\xa0 \n\n2018   \n\n2017   \n\n2016 \n\n \n\nRestructuring expenses by type (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \n \nCompensation and benefits-related expenses\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which severance expenses\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which accelerated deferred compensation\xc2\xa0 \nGeneral and administrative-related expenses\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which pension expenses\xc2\xa0 \nTotal restructuring expenses\xc2\xa0 \n\n246   \n169   \n77   \n380   \n74   \n626   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n294   \n192   \n102   \n161   \n49   \n455   \n\n358 \n218 \n140 \n182 \n27 \n540 \n\nThe principal risk measurement methodology for trading book expo-\nsures is value-at-risk.

Taxes assessed by a governmental author-\nity that are collected by the Group from a customer and both \nimposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing \ntransaction are excluded from revenue. The Group recognizes \nrevenue when it satisfies a contractual performance obligation. \nVariable consideration is only included in the transaction price \nonce it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of \ncumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncer-\ntainty associated with the amount of variable consideration is sub-\nsequently resolved. Generally no significant judgement is required \nwith respect to recording variable consideration.\n\nIf a fee is a fixed percentage of a variable account value at con-\ntract inception, recognition of the fee revenue is constrained as \nthe contractual consideration is highly susceptible to change due \nto factors outside of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s influence. However, at each \nperformance measurement period end (e.g., end-of-day, end-of-\nmonth, end-of-quarter), recognition of the cumulative amount of \nthe consideration to which the Group is entitled is no longer con-\nstrained because it is calculated based on a known account value \nand the fee revenue is no longer variable.\n\nNature of services\n\nThe following is a description of the principal activities from which \nthe Group generates its revenues from contracts with customers. \n\nThe performance obligations are typically satisfied as the services \nin the contract are rendered. The contract terms are generally such \nthat they do not result in any contract assets. The contracts gener-\nally do not include a significant financing component or obligations \nfor refunds or other similar obligations. Any variable consideration \nincluded in the transaction price is only recognized when the uncer-\ntainty of the amount is resolved and it is probable that a significant \nreversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur.\n\nCredit Suisse\xe2\x80\x99s wealth management businesses provide invest-\nment services and solutions for clients, including asset man-\nagement, investment advisory and investment management, \nwealth planning, and origination and structuring of sophisticated \nfinancing transactions. The Group receives for these services \ninvestment advisory and investment management fees which are \ngenerally reflected in the line item \xe2\x80\x98Investment and portfolio man-\nagement\xe2\x80\x99 in the table \xe2\x80\x9cContracts with customers and disaggre-\ngation of revenues\xe2\x80\x9d below. Generally, the fee for the service pro-\nvided is recognized over the period of time the service is provided.\n\nThe wealth management businesses also provide comprehensive \nadvisory services and tailored investment and financing solutions \nto private, corporate and institutional clients. The nature of the \nservices range from investment and wealth management activi-\nties, which are services rendered over a period of time according \nto the contract with the customer, to more transaction-specific \n\n294\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\nservices such as brokerage and sales and trading services and \nthe offer of client-tailored financing products. The services are \nprovided as requested by Credit Suisse\xe2\x80\x99s clients, and the fee for \nthe service requested is recognized once the service is provided. \n\nThe Group\xe2\x80\x99s asset management businesses offer investment solu-\ntions and services globally to a broad range of clients, including \npension funds, governments, foundations and endowments, corpo-\nrations and individuals. Fund managers typically enter into a variety \nof contracts to provide investment management and other services. \nA fund manager may satisfy its performance obligation indepen-\ndently or may engage a third party to satisfy some or all of a perfor-\nmance obligation on the fund manager\xe2\x80\x99s behalf. Although the fund \nmanager may have engaged a third party to provide inputs to the \noverall investment management services, the contractual obligation \nto provide investment management services to a customer remains \nthe primary responsibility of the fund manager. As such, the fund \nmanager is acting as a principal in the transaction. As a fund man-\nager, the Group typically receives base management fees and may \nadditionally receive performance-based management fees which \nare both recognized as \xe2\x80\x9cInvestment and portfolio management\xe2\x80\x9d rev-\nenues in the table \xe2\x80\x9cContracts with customers and disaggregation of \nrevenues\xe2\x80\x9d below. Base management fees are generally calculated \nbased on the net asset value (NAV) of the customer\xe2\x80\x99s investment, \nwhich can change during the performance period. Performance-\nbased management fees are variable consideration received by \nthe Group depending on the financial performance of the underly-\ning fund. As both the base management fees and performance-\nbased management fees are variable, the Group recognizes the \nfees once it is probable that a significant reversal of the revenue \nrecognized will not occur and when the uncertainty of the amount \nis resolved. The estimate of these variable fees is constrained until \nthe end of the performance measurement period. Generally, the \nuncertainty is resolved at the end of the performance measure-\nment period and therefore no significant judgement is necessary \nwhen recording variable consideration. Under a clawback obligation \nprovision, a fund manager may be required to return certain distri-\nbutions received from a fund if a specific performance threshold, \ni.e., benchmark, is not achieved at the end of the lifetime of the \nfund. The contractual clawback obligation is an additional factor of \nuncertainty which is considered in the constraint assessment. If the \nperformance-based management fee is earned but the clawback \nprovision has not lapsed, the clawback obligation is accounted for \nas a refund liability.\n\nThe Group\xe2\x80\x99s capital markets businesses underwrite and sell secu-\nrities on behalf of customers. Typically, the fees in these busi-\nnesses are recognized at a single point in time once the transac-\ntion is complete, i.e., when the securities have been placed with \ninvestors, and recognized as underwriting revenue. All expenses \nincurred in satisfying the performance obligation are deferred and \nrecognized once the transaction is complete. Generally Credit \nSuisse and other banks form a syndicate group to underwrite \nand place the securities for a customer. The Group may act as \nthe lead or a participating member in the syndicate group. Each \n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nmember of the syndicate group, including the lead and partici-\npating underwriters, is acting as principal for their proportionate \nshare of the syndication. As a result, the individual underwrit-\ners reflect their proportionate share of underwriting revenue and \nunderwriting costs on a gross basis.\n\nThe Group also offers brokerage services in its investment banking \nbusinesses, including global securities sales, trading and execution, \nprime brokerage and investment research. For the services pro-\nvided, such as the execution of client trades in securities or deriva-\ntives, the Group typically earns a brokerage commission when the \ntrade is executed. The Group generally acts as an agent when buy-\ning or selling exchange-traded cash securities, exchange-traded \nderivatives or centrally cleared OTC derivatives on behalf of clients.\n\nCredit Suisse\xe2\x80\x99s investment banking businesses provide services \nthat include advisory services to clients in connection with corpo-\nrate finance activities. The term \xe2\x80\x9cadvisory\xe2\x80\x9d includes any type of \n\nservice the Group provides in an advisory capacity. For these types \nof services, the Group typically receives a non-refundable retainer \nfee and/or a success fee which usually represents a percentage of \nthe transaction proceeds if and when the corporate finance activ-\nity is completed. Additionally, the contract may contain a milestone \nfee such as an \xe2\x80\x9cannouncement fee\xe2\x80\x9d that is payable upon the public \nannouncement of the corporate finance activity. Typically the fees \nin the investment banking business are recognized at a specific \npoint in time once it is determined that the performance obligation \nrelated to the transaction has been completed. A contract liability \nwill be recorded if the Group receives a payment such as a retainer \nfee or announcement fee for an advisory service prior to satisfying \nthe performance obligation. Advisory fees are recognized ratably \nover time in scenarios where the contracted service of the Group is \nto act as an advisor over a specified period not related to or depen-\ndent on the successful completion of a transaction. Revenues \nrecognized from these services are reflected in the line item \xe2\x80\x9cOther \nServices\xe2\x80\x9d in the table below.\n\nContracts with customers and disaggregation of revenues \nin\xc2\xa0 \n\nContracts with customers (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \nInvestment and portfolio management\xc2\xa0 \nOther securities business\xc2\xa0 \nUnderwriting\xc2\xa0 \nBrokerage\xc2\xa0 \nOther services\xc2\xa0 \nTotal revenues from contracts with customers\xc2\xa0 \n\nThe table above differs from \xe2\x80\x9cNote 6 \xe2\x80\x93 Commissions and fees\xe2\x80\x9d as \nit includes only those contracts with customers that are in scope \nof ASC Topic 606 \xe2\x80\x93 Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\n\nContract balances\nend of / in\xc2\xa0 \n\nContract balances (CHF million) \n \n \n \n \nContract receivables\xc2\xa0 \nContract liabilities\xc2\xa0 \nRevenue recognized in the reporting period included in \xc2\xa0 \nthe contract liabilities balance at the beginning of period\xc2\xa0 \n\n4Q18   \n\n3Q18   \n\n2Q18   \n\n898   \n13   \n330   \n647   \n492   \n2,380   \n\n896   \n12   \n405   \n623   \n452   \n2,388   \n\n896   \n11   \n513   \n749   \n471   \n2,640   \n\n \n\n1Q18 \n\n \n \n \n892 \n12 \n470 \n810 \n487 \n2,671 \n\n4Q18   \n\n3Q18   \n\n2Q18   \n\n1Q18 \n\n791   \n56   \n   \n16   \n\n845   \n66   \n   \n7   \n\n838   \n63   \n   \n13   \n\n \n \n \n \n758 \n67 \n \n13 \n\nThe Group did not recognize any revenues in the reporting period \nfrom performance obligations satisfied in previous periods.\n\nCapitalized costs\n\nIn 2018, we recognized a net impairment loss on contract receiv-\nables of CHF\xc2\xa02 million in the fourth quarter, CHF\xc2\xa06 million in the \nthird quarter and CHF\xc2\xa03 million in the second quarter of 2018. No \nimpairment losses were recognized on contract receivables in the \nfirst quarter of 2018. The Group did not recognize any contract \nassets during the fourth quarter, the third quarter, the second \nquarter and the first quarter of 2018.\n\nThe Group has not incurred costs to obtain a contract nor costs \nto fulfill a contract that are eligible for capitalization.\n\nRemaining performance obligations\n\nASC Topic\xc2\xa0606\xe2\x80\x99s practical expedient allows the Group to exclude \nfrom its remaining performance obligations disclosure any per-\nformance obligations which are part of a contract with an original \nexpected duration of one year or less.

amortized cost which are sold are reclassified to loans held-for-sale on or prior to the date of the sale.\n\nCredit quality of loans held at amortized cost\n\nManagement monitors the credit quality of loans through its credit \nrisk management processes, which are structured to assess, \nmeasure, monitor and manage risk on a consistent basis. This \nprocess requires careful consideration of proposed extensions \nof credit, the setting of specific limits, monitoring during the life \nof the exposure, active use of credit mitigation tools and a disci-\nplined approach to recognizing credit impairment.\n\nManagement evaluates many factors when assessing the credit \nquality of loans. These factors include the volatility of default \nprobabilities, rating changes, the magnitude of potential loss, \ninternal risk ratings, and geographic, industry and other economic \nfactors. For the purpose of credit quality disclosures, the Group \nuses detailed internal risk ratings which are aggregated to the \ncredit quality indicators investment grade and non-investment \ngrade.\n\nThe Group employs a set of credit ratings for the purpose of inter-\nnally rating counterparties. Credit ratings are intended to reflect \nthe risk of default of each counterparty. Ratings are assigned \nbased on internally developed rating models and processes, \nwhich are subject to governance and internally independent vali-\ndation procedures.\n\nInternal ratings are assigned to all loans reflecting the Group\xe2\x80\x99s \ninternal view of the credit quality of the counterparty. Inter-\nnal ratings may differ from a counterparty\xe2\x80\x99s external ratings, if \nsuch ratings are available. Internal ratings are regularly reviewed \ndepending on exposure type, client segment, collateral or event-\ndriven developments. For the calculation of internal risk estimates \n(e.g., an estimate of expected loss in the event of a counterparty \ndefault) and risk-weighted assets, a probability of default (PD), \nloss given default (LGD) and exposure at default are assigned to \neach facility. These three parameters are primarily derived from \ninternally developed statistical models that have been backtested \nagainst internal experience, validated by a function independent of \nthe model owners on a regular basis and approved by the Group\xe2\x80\x99s \n\nmain regulators for application in the regulatory capital calculation \nin the advanced internal ratings-based approach (A-IRB) under \nthe Basel framework. For the majority of clients and counterpar-\nties, internal ratings or PDs are calculated directly by proprietary \nstatistical rating models. These models are based on internally \ncompiled data comprising both quantitative factors (e.g., primarily \nbalance sheet information for corporates and loan-to-value ratio \nand the borrower\xe2\x80\x99s income level for mortgage lending) and quali-\ntative factors (e.g., credit histories from credit reporting bureaus) \nconcentrating on economic trends and financial fundamentals. \nFor statistical rating models calculating a PD, an equivalent rating \nbased on the Standard & Poor\xe2\x80\x99s rating scale is assigned based \non the PD band associated with each rating, which is used for \ndisclosure purposes. For the remaining facilities where statistical \nrating models are not used, a PD is determined through an inter-\nnal rating assigned on the basis of a structured expert approach. \nCredit officers make use of peer analyses, industry comparisons, \nexternal ratings and research as well as the judgment of credit \nexperts for the purpose of their analysis. The PD for each internal \nrating is calibrated to historical default experience using internal \ndata and external data from Standard & Poor\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\nReverse repurchase agreements are fully collateralized and in the \nevent of counterparty default the reverse repurchase agreement \nprovides the Group the right to liquidate the collateral held. Group \nrisk management manages these instruments on the basis of the \nvalue of the underlying collateral, as opposed to loans, which are \nrisk-managed on the ability of the counterparty to repay. There-\nfore the underlying collateral coverage is the most appropriate \ncredit quality indicator for reverse repurchase agreements. As \nsuch, reverse repurchase agreements have not been included in \nthe tables of this note.\n\nThe following tables present the Group\xe2\x80\x99s recorded investment in \nloans held at amortized cost by aggregated internal counterparty \ncredit ratings investment grade and non-investment grade that \nare used as credit quality indicators for the purpose of this disclo-\nsure, and a related aging analysis.\n\n300\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n\x0c \n\nGross loans held at amortized cost by internal counterparty rating\n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \nend of\xc2\xa0 \n\n2018 (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \nMortgages\xc2\xa0 \nLoans collateralized by securities\xc2\xa0 \nConsumer finance\xc2\xa0 \nConsumer\xc2\xa0 \nReal estate\xc2\xa0 \nCommercial and industrial loans\xc2\xa0 \nFinancial institutions\xc2\xa0 \nGovernments and public institutions\xc2\xa0 \nCorporate & institutional\xc2\xa0 \nGross loans held at amortized cost\xc2\xa0 \nValue of collateral\xc2\xa01 \n\n2017 (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \nMortgages\xc2\xa0 \nLoans collateralized by securities\xc2\xa0 \nConsumer finance\xc2\xa0 \nConsumer\xc2\xa0 \nReal estate\xc2\xa0 \nCommercial and industrial loans\xc2\xa0 \nFinancial institutions\xc2\xa0 \nGovernments and public institutions\xc2\xa0 \nCorporate & institutional\xc2\xa0 \nGross loans held at amortized cost\xc2\xa0 \nValue of collateral\xc2\xa01 \n\n \n\n \n \n\nTotal \n\n \n \n \n107,845 \n42,034 \n3,882 \n153,761 \n26,065 \n79,773 \n12,939 \n1,185 \n119,962 \n273,723 \n242,034 \n\n \n \n \n106,039 \n42,016 \n4,222 \n152,277 \n26,003 \n76,025 \n9,326 \n1,199 \n112,553 \n264,830 \n239,741 \n\n \n\n \n\nInvestment       \ngrade       \n\nAAA to BBB   \n\nNon-investment   \ngrade   \nD   \n\nBB to C   \n\n97,404   \n39,281   \n1,465   \n138,150   \n19,461   \n40,872   \n10,715   \n1,132   \n72,180   \n210,330   \n192,579   \n\n94,553   \n38,387   \n1,801   \n134,741   \n20,278   \n39,475   \n7,258   \n1,124   \n68,135   \n202,876   \n189,048   \n\n10,046   \n2,676   \n2,247   \n14,969   \n6,494   \n37,633   \n2,138   \n53   \n46,318   \n61,287   \n47,999   \n\n11,214   \n3,530   \n2,241   \n16,985   \n5,640   \n35,250   \n2,022   \n74   \n42,986   \n59,971   \n49,271   \n\n395   \n77   \n170   \n642   \n110   \n1,268   \n86   \n0   \n1,464   \n2,106   \n1,456   \n\n272   \n99   \n180   \n551   \n85   \n1,300   \n46   \n1   \n1,432   \n1,983   \n1,422   \n\n1 Includes the value of collateral up to the amount of the outstanding related loans. For mortgages, the value of collateral is determined at the time of granting the loan and thereafter regu-\n\nlarly reviewed according to the Group\xe2\x80\x99s risk management policies and directives, with maximum review periods determined by property type, market liquidity and market transparency.\n\nValue of collateral\nIn the Group\xe2\x80\x99s private banking, corporate and institutional busi-\nnesses, all collateral values for loans are regularly reviewed \naccording to the Group\xe2\x80\x99s risk management policies and direc-\ntives, with maximum review periods determined by collateral type, \nmarket liquidity and market transparency. For example, traded \nsecurities are revalued on a daily basis and property values are \nappraised over a period of more than one year considering the \ncharacteristics of the property, current developments in the rel-\nevant real estate market and the current level of credit exposure \nto the borrower. If the credit exposure to a borrower has changed \nsignificantly, in volatile markets or in times of increasing general \nmarket risk, collateral values may be appraised more frequently. \nManagement judgment is applied in assessing whether markets \n\nare volatile or general market risk has increased to a degree that \nwarrants a more frequent update of collateral values. Movements \nin monitored risk metrics that are statistically different compared \nto historical experience are considered in addition to analysis of \nexternally-provided forecasts, scenario techniques and macro-\neconomic research. For impaired loans, the fair value of collateral \nis determined within 90 days of the date the impairment was \nidentified and thereafter regularly revalued by Group credit risk \nmanagement within the impairment review process.\n\nIn the Group\xe2\x80\x99s investment banking businesses, collateral-depen-\ndent loans are appraised on at least an annual basis, or when a \nloan-relevant event occurs.\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n301\n\n\x0c \n\nGross loans held at amortized cost \xe2\x80\x93 aging analysis \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \nend of\xc2\xa0

related to consumer mortgages secured by residential real estate for which formal foreclo-\n\nsure proceedings according to local requirements of the applicable jurisdiction were in process.\n\nWrite-off and recovery of loans\nWrite-off of a loan occurs when it is considered certain that there \nis no possibility of recovering the outstanding principal. In the \nGroup\xe2\x80\x99s investment banking businesses, a loan is written down \nto its net book value once the loan provision is greater than 80% \nof the loan notional amount, unless repayment of the loan is \nanticipated to occur within the next two quarters. In the Group\xe2\x80\x99s \nprivate banking, corporate and institutional businesses, write-\noffs are made, based on an individual counterparty assessment \nperformed by Group credit risk management, if it is certain that \nparts of a loan or the entire loan will not be recoverable. For col-\nlateralized loans, the collateral is assessed and the unsecured \nexposure is written off. Write-offs on uncollateralized loans are \nbased on the borrower\xe2\x80\x99s ability to pay back the outstanding loan \nout of free cash flow. The Group evaluates the recoverability of \nthe loans granted, if a borrower is expected to default wholly or \n\npartly on its contractual payment obligations or to meet these \nonly with third-party support. Adjustments are made to reflect the \nestimated realizable value of the loan or any collateral. Triggers to \nassess the creditworthiness of a borrower to absorb the adverse \ndevelopments include i)\xc2\xa0a default on interest or principal pay-\nments by more than 90 days, ii)\xc2\xa0a waiver of interest or principal by \nthe Group, iii)\xc2\xa0a downgrade of the loan to non-interest-earning, \niv)\xc2\xa0the collection of the debt through seizure order, bankruptcy \nproceedings or realization of collateral, or v)\xc2\xa0the insolvency of the \nborrower. Based on such assessment, Group credit risk man-\nagement evaluates the need for write-offs individually and on an \nongoing basis.\n\nRecoveries of loans previously written off are recorded based on \nthe cash or estimated fair value of other assets received.\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n303\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nGross impaired loan details\n\xc2\xa0

information and events, it is probable that the Group will be \nunable to collect the amounts due according to the contractual \nterms of the loan agreement. The Group performs an in-depth \nreview and analysis of impaired loans considering factors such as \nrecovery and exit options as well as collateral and counterparty \nrisk. In general, all impaired loans are individually assessed. The \ntrigger to detect an impaired loan is non-payment of interest, prin-\ncipal amounts or other contractual payment obligations. In addi-\ntion, loans to corporates and institutions managed on the Swiss \nplatform are regularly reviewed depending on exposure type, cli-\nent segment, collateral or event-driven developments. All other \ncorporate and institutional loans are reviewed at least annually \nbased on the borrower\xe2\x80\x99s financial statements and any indications \nof difficulties they may experience. Loans that are not impaired, \nbut which are of special concern due to changes in covenants, \ndowngrades, negative financial news and other adverse develop-\nments, are either transferred to recovery management or included \non a watch list. All loans on the watch list are reviewed at least \n\nquarterly to determine whether they should be released, remain \non the watch list or be moved to recovery management. For loans \nin recovery management from the Swiss platform, larger positions \nare reviewed on a quarterly basis for any event-driven changes. \nOtherwise, these loans are reviewed at least annually. All other \nloans in recovery management are reviewed on at least a quar-\nterly basis. If an individual loan specifically identified for evaluation \nis considered impaired, the allowance is determined as a reason-\nable estimate of credit losses existing as of the end of the report-\ning period. Thereafter, the allowance is revalued by credit risk \nmanagement at least annually or more frequently depending on \nthe risk profile of the borrower or credit relevant events. For non-\ncollateral-dependent impaired loans, an impairment is measured \nusing the present value of estimated future cash flows, except \nthat as a practical expedient an impairment may be measured \nbased on a loan\xe2\x80\x99s observable market price. If the present value of \nestimated future cash flows is used, the impaired loan and related \nallowance are revalued to reflect the passage of time. For collat-\neral-dependent impaired loans, an impairment is measured using \nthe fair value of the collateral.\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n305\n\n\x0c

accordance with US GAAP, the Group continually assesses \nwhether or not there has been a triggering event requiring a review \nof goodwill. The Group determined in 2018 that a goodwill triggering \nevent occurred for the Asia Pacific \xe2\x80\x93 Markets, Global Markets and \nInvestment Banking & Capital Markets reporting units.\n\nBased on its goodwill impairment analysis performed as of \nDecember\xc2\xa031, 2018, the Group concluded that the estimated \nfair value for all of the reporting units with goodwill substantially \nexceeded their related carrying values and no impairment was \nnecessary as of December\xc2\xa031, 2018.\n\nThe carrying value of each reporting unit for the purpose of the \ngoodwill impairment test is determined by considering the report-\ning units\xe2\x80\x99 risk-weighted assets usage, leverage ratio exposure, \ndeferred tax assets, goodwill and intangible assets. Any residual \nequity, after considering the total of these elements, is allocated \nto the reporting units on a pro-rata basis.\n\nIn estimating the fair value of its reporting units, the Group applied \na combination of the market approach and the income approach. \nUnder the market approach, consideration was given to price to pro-\njected earnings multiples or price to book value multiples for similarly \ntraded companies and prices paid in recent transactions that have \noccurred in its industry or in related industries. Under the income \napproach, a discount rate was applied that reflects the risk and \n\nuncertainty related to the reporting unit\xe2\x80\x99s projected cash flows, which \nwere determined from the Group\xe2\x80\x99s financial plan.\n\nIn determining the estimated fair value, the Group relied upon its \nlatest five-year strategic business plan which included significant \nmanagement assumptions and estimates based on its view of \ncurrent and future economic conditions and regulatory changes, \nand as approved by the Board of Directors. \n\nThe Group engaged the services of an independent valuation spe-\ncialist to assist in the valuation of the Asia Pacific \xe2\x80\x93 Markets, Global \nMarkets and Investment Banking & Capital Markets reporting units \nas of December\xc2\xa031, 2018. The valuations were performed using a \ncombination of the market approach and income approach.\n\nThe results of the impairment evaluation of each reporting unit\xe2\x80\x99s \ngoodwill would be significantly impacted by adverse changes in \nthe underlying parameters used in the valuation process. If actual \noutcomes adversely differ by a significant margin from its best \nestimates of the key economic assumptions and associated cash \nflows applied in the valuation of the reporting unit, the Group \ncould potentially incur material impairment charges in the future.\n\nAs a result of acquisitions, the Group has recorded goodwill as \nan asset in its consolidated balance sheets, the most significant \ncomponent of which arose from the acquisition of Donaldson, \nLufkin & Jenrette Inc. in 2000.\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n307\n\n\x0c \n\n

These agreements provide for the \nnet settlement of all transactions under the agreement through \na single payment in the event of default or termination under the \nagreement. They allow the Group to offset balances from deriva-\ntive assets and liabilities as well as the receivables and payables \nto related cash collateral transacted with the same counterparty. \nCollateral for OTC derivatives is received and provided in the form \nof cash and marketable securities. Such collateral may be subject \nto the standard industry terms of an ISDA Credit Support Annex. \nThe terms of an ISDA Credit Support Annex provide that securi-\nties received or provided as collateral may be pledged or sold \nduring the term of the transactions and must be returned upon \nmaturity of the transaction. These terms also give each coun-\nterparty the right to terminate the related transactions upon the \nother counterparty\xe2\x80\x99s failure to post collateral. Financial collateral \nreceived or pledged for OTC derivatives may also be subject to \ncollateral agreements which restrict the use of financial collateral.\n\nFor derivatives transacted with exchanges (exchange-traded \nderivatives) and central clearing counterparties (OTC-cleared \nderivatives), positive and negative replacement values (PRV/NRV) \nand related cash collateral may be offset if the terms of the rules \nand regulations governing these exchanges and central clearing \ncounterparties permit such netting and offset.\n\nWhere no such agreements or terms exist, fair values are \nrecorded on a gross basis.\n\nExchange-traded derivatives or OTC-cleared derivatives, which \nare fully margined and for which the daily margin payments con-\nstitute settlement of the outstanding exposure, are not included \nin the offsetting disclosures because they are not subject to off-\nsetting due to the daily settlement. The daily margin payments, \nwhich are not settled until the next settlement cycle is conducted, \nare presented in brokerage receivables or brokerage payables. \nThe notional amount for these daily settled derivatives is included \nin the fair value of derivative instruments table in \xe2\x80\x9cNote 32 \xe2\x80\x93 \nDerivatives and hedging activities\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nUnder US GAAP, the Group elected to account for substantially \nall financial instruments with an embedded derivative that is not \nconsidered clearly and closely related to the host contract at fair \nvalue. There is an exception for certain bifurcatable hybrid debt \ninstruments which the Group did not elect to account for at fair \nvalue. However, these bifurcated embedded derivatives are gen-\nerally not subject to enforceable master netting agreements and \nare not recorded as derivative instruments under trading assets \nand liabilities or other assets and other liabilities.

In certain situ-\nations, for example, in the event of default, all contracts under \nthe agreements are terminated and are settled net in one single \npayment. Global master repurchase agreements also include \npayment or settlement netting provisions in the normal course of \nbusiness that state that all amounts in the same currency pay-\nable by each party to the other under any transaction or otherwise \nunder the global master repurchase agreement on the same date \nshall be set off.\n\nTransactions under such agreements are netted in the consoli-\ndated balance sheets if they are with the same counterparty, \nhave the same maturity date, settle through the same clearing \ninstitution and are subject to the same enforceable master net-\nting agreement. The amounts offset are measured on the same \nbasis as the underlying transaction (i.e., on an accrual basis or fair \nvalue basis).\n\ncriteria as for reverse repurchase and repurchase agreements. In \ngeneral, most securities lending and borrowing transactions do \nnot meet the criterion of having the same settlement date speci-\nfied at inception of the transaction, and therefore they are not \neligible for netting in the consolidated balance sheets. However, \nsecurities lending and borrowing transactions with explicit matu-\nrity dates may be eligible for netting in the consolidated balance \nsheets.\n\nReverse repurchase and repurchase agreements are collateralized \nprincipally by government securities, money market instruments \nand corporate bonds and have terms ranging from overnight to \na longer or unspecified period of time. In the event of counter-\nparty default, the reverse repurchase agreement or securities \nlending agreement provides the Group with the right to liquidate \nthe collateral held. As is the case in the Group\xe2\x80\x99s normal course of \nbusiness, a significant portion of the collateral received that may \nbe sold or repledged was sold or repledged as of December 31, \n2018 and December 31, 2017. In certain circumstances, financial \ncollateral received may be restricted during the term of the agree-\nment (e.g., in tri-party arrangements).\n\nSecurities lending and borrowing transactions are generally \nexecuted under global master securities lending agreements with \nnetting terms similar to ISDA Master Agreements. In certain situ-\nations, for example in the event of default, all contracts under \nthe agreement are terminated and are settled net in one single \npayment.

US tax \nlaw allowed for a 20-year carry-forward period for existing net \noperating losses as of the end of 2017 and any new net operat-\ning losses will have an unlimited carry-forward period, Swiss tax \nlaw allows for a seven-year carry-forward period for net operat-\ning losses and UK tax law allows for an unlimited carry-forward \nperiod for net operating losses.\n\nTax benefits associated with share-based compensation\nin\xc2\xa0 \n\n2018   \n\n2017   \n\n2016 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nTax benefits associated with share-based compensation (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \n \nTax benefits recorded in the consolidated \xc2\xa0 \nstatements of operations\xc2\xa01 \nWindfall tax benefits/(shortfall tax charges) \xc2\xa0 \nrecorded in additional paid-in capital\xc2\xa02 \n\n   \n314   \n   \n\xe2\x80\x93   \n\n   \n242   \n   \n\xe2\x80\x93   \n\n \n391 \n \n(110) \n\n \n\n1 Calculated at the statutory tax rate before valuation allowance considerations.\n2 As a result of the adoption of ASU 2016-09 windfall tax benefits and shortfall tax \n\ncharges on share-based compensation are recognized in the consolidated statements of \noperations and no longer in additional paid-in capital.\n\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cNote 29 \xe2\x80\x93 Employee deferred compensation\xe2\x80\x9d for further information \n\non share-based compensation.\n\nIf, upon settlement of share-based compensation, the tax deduc-\ntion exceeds the cumulative compensation cost that the Group \nhad recognized in the consolidated financial statements, the \nutilized tax benefit associated with any excess deduction is con-\nsidered a \xe2\x80\x9cwindfall\xe2\x80\x9d and recognized in the consolidated state-\nments of operations and reflected as an operating cash inflow in \nthe consolidated statements of cash flows. If, upon settlement, \nthe tax deduction is lower than the cumulative compensation cost \nthat the Group had recognized in the consolidated financial state-\nments, the tax charge associated with the lower deduction is \nconsidered a \xe2\x80\x9cshortfall\xe2\x80\x9d. Tax charges arising on shortfalls are rec-\nognized in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\nUncertain tax positions\nUS GAAP requires a two-step process in evaluating uncertain \nincome tax positions. In the first step, an enterprise determines \nwhether it is more likely than not that an income tax position will \nbe sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related \nappeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits \nof the position. Income tax positions meeting the more-likely-\nthan-not recognition threshold are then measured to determine \nthe amount of benefit eligible for recognition in the consolidated \nfinancial statements. Each income tax position is measured at \nthe largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not to be \nrealized upon ultimate settlement.\n\nDue to uncertainty concerning its ability to generate the neces-\nsary amount and mix of taxable income in future periods, the \nGroup recorded a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets \nin the amount of CHF\xc2\xa04.0 billion as of December 31, 2018 com-\npared to CHF\xc2\xa04.3 billion as of December 31, 2017.\n\nAmounts and expiration dates of net operating loss \ncarry-forwards \nend of 2018\xc2\xa0 \n\nNet operating loss carry-forwards (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \nDue to expire within 1 year\xc2\xa0 \nDue to expire within 2 to 5 years\xc2\xa0 \nDue to expire within 6 to 10 years\xc2\xa0 \nDue to expire within 11 to 20 years\xc2\xa0 \nAmount due to expire\xc2\xa0 \nAmount not due to expire\xc2\xa0 \nTotal net operating loss carry-forwards\xc2\xa0 \n\nMovements in the valuation allowance \nin\xc2\xa0 \n\n2018   \n\n \n\nMovements in the valuation allowance (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \n \n4,279   \nBalance at beginning of period\xc2\xa0 \n(258)   \nNet changes\xc2\xa0 \nBalance at end of period\xc2\xa0 \n4,021   \n\n \n\n \n\nTotal \n\n108 \n6,658 \n1,404 \n6,798 \n14,968 \n18,631 \n33,599 \n\n2017   \n\n2016 \n\n \n\n \n\n4,188   \n91   \n4,279   \n\n3,905 \n283 \n4,188 \n\nAs part of its normal practice, the Group has conducted a \ndetailed evaluation of its expected future results.

Unless there is a contractual obligation, granting \ndeferred compensation is solely at the discretion of the Com-\npensation Committee and senior management. Special deferred \ncompensation granted as part of a contractual obligation is typi-\ncally used to compensate new senior employees for forfeited \nawards from previous employers upon joining the Group. It is the \nGroup\xe2\x80\x99s policy not to make multi-year guarantees.\n\nCompensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement \nof operations for share-based and other awards that were granted \nas deferred compensation is recognized in accordance with the \nspecific terms and conditions of each respective award and is \nprimarily recognized over the future requisite service and vesting \nperiod, which is determined by the plan, retirement eligibility of \nemployees, two-year moratorium periods on early retirement and \ncertain other terms. All deferred compensation plans are subject \nto restrictive covenants, which generally include non-compete and \nnon-solicit provisions. Compensation expense for share-based \nand other awards that were granted as deferred compensation \nalso includes the current estimated outcome of applicable perfor-\nmance criteria, estimated future forfeitures and mark-to-market \nadjustments for certain cash awards that are still outstanding.\n\nThe following tables show the compensation expense for deferred \ncompensation awards granted in 2018 and prior years that was \nrecognized in the consolidated statements of operations during \n2018, 2017 and 2016, the total shares delivered, the estimated \nunrecognized compensation expense for deferred compensa-\ntion awards granted in 2018 and prior years outstanding as of \nDecember 31, 2018 and the remaining requisite service period \nover which the estimated unrecognized compensation expense \nwill be recognized.

CCA are scheduled to vest on the third anni-\nversary of the grant date, other than those granted to individu-\nals classified as risk managers or senior managers under the UK \nPRA Remuneration Code or similar regulations in other jurisdic-\ntions, where CCA vest on the fifth and seventh anniversaries of \nthe grant date, respectively, and will be expensed over the vesting \nperiod. CCA generally provide a conditional right to receive semi-\nannual cash payments of interest equivalents until settled, with \nrates being dependent upon the vesting period and currency of \ndenomination:\np  CCA granted in 2019, 2018 and 2017 that are denominated in \nUS dollars and vest three years from the date of grant receive \ninterest equivalents at a rate of 4.46%, 3.05% and 4.27%, \nrespectively, per annum over the six-month US dollar London \nInterbank Offered Rate (LIBOR);\n\np  CCA granted in 2019, 2018 and 2017 that are denominated \n\nin Swiss francs and vest three years from the date of grant \nreceive interest equivalents at a rate of 3.73%, 2.24% and \n3.17%, respectively, per annum over the six-month Swiss franc \nLIBOR;\n\np  CCA granted in 2017 that are denominated in US dollars and \nvest five or seven years from the date of grant receive interest \nequivalents at a rate of 4.27% per annum over the six-month \nUS-dollar LIBOR; and\n\np  CCA granted in 2017 that are denominated in Swiss francs \nand vest five or seven years from the date of grant receive \ninterest equivalents at a rate of 3.03% and 2.93%, respec-\ntively, per annum over the six-month Swiss franc LIBOR.\n\nThe rates were set in line with market conditions at the time of \ngrant and existing high-trigger and low-trigger contingent capi-\ntal instruments that the Group has issued. For CCA granted in \nFebruary 2019, employees who received compensation in Swiss \nfrancs received CCA denominated in Swiss francs and all other \nemployees received CCA denominated in US dollars.\n\nAs CCA qualify as going concern loss-absorbing capital of the \nGroup, the timing and form of distribution upon settlement is sub-\nject to approval by FINMA. At settlement, employees will receive \neither a contingent capital instrument or a cash payment based \non the fair value of the CCA. The fair value will be determined by \nthe Group. In the case of a cash settlement, the CCA award will \nbe converted into the local currency of each respective employee.\n\nCCA have loss-absorbing features such that prior to settlement, \nthe principal amount of the CCA would be written down to zero \nand forfeited if any of the following trigger events were to occur:\np  the Group\xe2\x80\x99s reported common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio falls \n\nbelow 7%; or\n\np  FINMA determines that cancellation of the CCA and other \n\nsimilar contingent capital instruments is necessary, or that the \nGroup requires public sector capital support, in either case to \nprevent it from becoming insolvent or otherwise failing.\n\nOn February\xc2\xa015, 2019, the Group awarded CHF\xc2\xa0299 million of \nCCA that will be expensed over the vesting period. The estimated \nunrecognized compensation expense of CHF\xc2\xa0273 million was \ndetermined based on the fair value of the awards on the grant date \nand includes the current estimated outcome of the relevant perfor-\nmance criteria, the estimated future forfeitures and the expected \nsemi-annual cash payments of interest equivalents and will be rec-\nognized over the vesting period.\n\nContingent Capital Awards granted for previous years\nFor compensation year\xc2\xa0 \nCCA awarded (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \n\n2018   \n299   \n\n2017   \n241   \n\n2016 \n229 \n\nContingent Capital share awards\n\nIn March 2016, the Group executed a voluntary exchange offer, \nunder which employees had the right to voluntarily convert all or \na portion of their respective CCA into Contingent Capital share \nawards at a conversion price of CHF\xc2\xa014.57. CCA holders elected \nto convert CHF\xc2\xa0226 million of their CCA into Contingent Capital \nshare awards during the election period. This fair value repre-\nsented an approximate conversion rate of 15%.

The number of deferred share-based \nawards held by each individual was increased by 3.64%. The terms and conditions of the \nadjusted shares were the same as the existing share-based awards, thereby ensuring that \nholders of the awards were neither advantaged nor disadvantaged by the additional Con-\ntingent Capital shares granted.\n\nCapital Opportunity Facility awards\n\nAs part of the 2011 annual compensation process, the Group \nawarded a portion of deferred variable compensation for senior \nemployees in the form of 2011 Partner Asset Facility (PAF2) \nunits. PAF2 units were essentially fixed income structured notes \n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n325\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nthat are exposed to a portion of the credit risk that arises in the \nGroup\xe2\x80\x99s derivative activities, including both current and possible \nfuture swaps and other derivative transactions.\n\nPAF2 awards were linked to a portfolio of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s credit \nexposures, providing risk offset and capital relief. Due to regula-\ntory changes, this capital relief would no longer be available. As a \nresult, the Group restructured the awards, requiring PAF2 holders \nto reallocate the exposure of their awards from the pool of coun-\nterparty credit risks in the original PAF2 structure to one of the \nfollowing options, or a combination thereof:\np  i) Capital Opportunity Facility (COF): participants elected for \ntheir award to be referenced to a COF. The COF is a seven-\nyear facility that is linked to the performance of a portfolio of \nrisk-transfer and capital mitigation transactions to be entered \ninto with the Group chosen by a COF management team. The \nvalue of the COF awards will be reduced if there are losses \nfrom the COF portfolio, up to the full amount of the award. \nParticipants who elect the COF will receive semi-annual US \ndollar cash distributions of 6.5% per annum until settlement in \ncash in 2021, and such semi-annual distributions will reduce \nthe cash settlement amount payable in 2021; and\n\np  ii) CCA: participants elected to receive CCA, with similar terms \n\nto the instruments granted as part of the 2013 compensation \nawards.\n\n2008 Partner Asset Facility awards\n\nAs part of the 2008 annual compensation process, the Group \ngranted employees in the former Investment Banking division with \nthe corporate title of managing director or director the major-\nity of the deferred compensation in the form of 2008 Partner \nAsset Facility (PAF) awards, denominated in US dollars. The PAF \nawards were indexed to, and represented a first-loss interest in, a \nspecified pool of illiquid assets (Asset Pool) that originated in the \nformer Investment Banking division.\n\nIn the final year of the contractual term, the PAF holders received \na final settlement in cash equal to the notional value, less all pre-\nvious cash payments made to the PAF holder, plus any related \ngains or less any related losses on the liquidation of the Asset \nPool. During 2017, the final settlement of the outstanding PAF \nawards of CHF\xc2\xa0789 million was made.\n\nOther cash awards\n\nOther cash awards include certain special awards as well as vol-\nuntary deferred compensation plans and employee investment \nplans. For certain special awards, compensation expense was \nprimarily driven by their vesting schedule; for other cash awards, \ncompensation expense was driven by mark to market and per-\nformance adjustments, as the majority of the awards are fully \nvested.\n\nDuring 2018, the Group granted deferred fixed cash compensa-\ntion of CHF\xc2\xa098 million to certain employees in the Americas. This \ncompensation will be expensed in the Global Markets, Investment \nBanking & Capital Markets and International Wealth Manage-\nment divisions over a three-year vesting period from the grant date. \nAmortization of this compensation totaled CHF\xc2\xa052 million in 2018.\n\nDuring 2017, the Group granted deferred cash retention awards \nof CHF\xc2\xa065 million relating to the reorganization of the Asia Pacific \nbusiness. These awards will be expensed over a two-year vest-\ning period from the grant date. Amortization of these awards \ntotaled CHF\xc2\xa028 million in 2017 and was recognized in the Cor-\nporate Center. The Group granted deferred fixed cash awards of \nCHF\xc2\xa090 million to certain employees in the US. These awards will \nbe expensed in the Global Markets, Investment Banking & Capi-\ntal Markets and International Wealth Management divisions over \na three-year vesting period from the grant date. Amortization of \nthese awards totaled CHF\xc2\xa048 million in 2017.\n\nIn 2016, the Group granted deferred share and cash retention \nawards of CHF\xc2\xa0249 million relating to the reorganization of the \nGlobal Markets and Investment Banking & Capital Markets busi-\nnesses. These awards will be expensed over a vesting period of up \nto seven years from the grant date. Amortization of these awards in \n2016 of CHF\xc2\xa0118 million was recognized in the Corporate Center.\n\nDelivered shares\n\nIn 2018 and 2017, the Group fully covered its share delivery obli-\ngations through market purchases. In 2016, the Group\xe2\x80\x99s share \ndelivery obligations were covered mainly through the issuance of \nshares from conditional capital, with a portion covered by shares \npurchased in the market.\n\n326\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\n30  Related parties\n\nParties are considered to be related if one party has the ability \nto control the other party or exercise significant influence over \nthe other party in making financial or operational decisions, or if \nanother party controls both.

Key man-\nagement personnel are those individuals having authority and \nresponsibility for planning, directing and controlling the activities \nof the Group, that is, members of the Executive Board and the \nBoard of Directors.\n\nBanking relationships\n\nThe Group is a global financial services provider. Many of the \nmembers of the Executive Board and the Board of Directors, their \nclose family members or companies associated with them main-\ntain banking relationships with the Group. The Group or any of its \nbanking subsidiaries may from time to time enter into financing \nand other banking agreements with companies in which current \nmembers of the Executive Board or the Board of Directors have \na significant influence as defined by the SEC, such as holding \nexecutive and/or board level roles in these companies. With the \nexception of the transactions described below, relationships with \nmembers of the Executive Board or the Board of Directors and \nsuch companies are in the ordinary course of business and are \nentered into on an arm\xe2\x80\x99s length basis. Also, unless otherwise \nnoted, all loans to members of the Executive Board, members of \nthe Board of Directors, their close family members or companies \nassociated with them were made in the ordinary course of busi-\nness, were made on substantially the same terms, including inter-\nest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for com-\nparable transactions with other persons and did not involve more \nthan the normal risk of collectability or present other unfavor-\nable features.

Loans against securities \nare granted at interest rates and on terms applicable to such \nloans granted to other employees. The same credit approval and \nrisk assessment procedures apply to members of the Executive \nBoard as for other employees. Unless otherwise noted, all loans \nto members of the Executive Board were made in the ordinary \ncourse of business and substantially on the same terms, includ-\ning interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for \ncomparable transactions with other persons and in consideration \nof the terms which apply to all Group employees. These loans did \nnot involve more than the normal risk of collectability or present \nother unfavorable features.

The benefits to be provided to a participant \nare solely based on the contributions made to that employee\xe2\x80\x99s \naccount and are affected by income, expenses and gains and \nlosses allocated to the account. As such, there are no stipulations \nof a defined annuity benefit at retirement and the participants \nbear the full actuarial as well as investment risk.\n\nThe Group contributes to various defined contribution pension \nplans primarily in the US and the UK as well as other countries \nthroughout the world. During 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Group \ncontributed to these plans and recognized as expense CHF\xc2\xa0153 \nmillion, CHF\xc2\xa0165 million and CHF\xc2\xa0161 million, respectively.\n\nDefined benefit pension and other post-retirement \ndefined benefit plans\n\nDefined benefit pension plans\nDefined benefit pension plans are pension plans that define spe-\ncific benefits for an employee upon that employee\xe2\x80\x99s retirement. \nThese benefits are usually determined by taking into account the \nemployee\xe2\x80\x99s salary, years of service and age of retirement. Retir-\nees bear neither the actuarial risk (for example, the risk that the \nretirees of the plan live longer than expected), nor the investment \nrisk (that is, that plan assets invested and associated returns will \nbe insufficient to meet the expected benefits due to low or nega-\ntive returns on contributions). The Group\xe2\x80\x99s funding policy for these \nplans is in accordance with local laws and tax requirements.\n\nSwiss pension plan\nThe Group\xe2\x80\x99s most significant defined benefit pension plan, the \nCredit Suisse Swiss Pension Plan (Swiss pension plan), is located \nand covers its employees in Switzerland and is set up as a trust \ndomiciled in Zurich. The Swiss pension plan provides benefits in \nthe event of retirement, death and disability and meets or exceeds \nthe minimum benefits required under the Swiss Federal Law on \nOccupational Retirement, Survivors\xe2\x80\x99 and Disability Pension Plans \n(BVG). Benefits in the Swiss pension plan are determined on the \nbasis of the accumulated employer and employee contributions \nand accumulated interest credited. Although the Swiss pension \nplan is largely defined contribution in nature, it is treated as a \ndefined benefit plan under US GAAP, mainly due to a guaran-\nteed minimum return on contributions and guaranteed payment of \nlifetime pensions. As of December\xc2\xa031, 2018 and 2017, the Swiss \npension plan comprised 69% and 73%, respectively, of all the \nGroup\xe2\x80\x99s employees participating in defined benefit plans, 82% \n\nEmployee contributions in the savings section depend on their \nage and are determined as a percentage of the pensionable sal-\nary. The employees can select between three different levels of \ncontributions which vary between 5% and 14% depending on \ntheir age. The Group\xe2\x80\x99s contribution varies between 7.5% and \n25% of the pensionable salary depending on the employee\xe2\x80\x99s age.\n\nThe Swiss Federal council sets the minimum statutory interest \nrate on savings balances on an annual basis that applies to the \nBVG minimum pensionable salary (1.0% as of January\xc2\xa01, 2019 \nand 2018). The statutory interest rate on savings balances does \nnot apply to extra mandatory benefits. The Board of Trustees of \nthe Swiss pension fund sets the interest rate to be applied on the \naccumulated savings balance on an annual basis.\n\nWhen employees retire, their savings balance is converted into an \nannuity and the conversion rate is the percentage used to convert \nthe assets accrued in the Swiss pension plan to an annual lifetime \nretirement pension. The level of the conversion rate depends on \nthe life expectancy of future retirees and on the long-term poten-\ntial for returns in the capital markets. The Board of Trustees of \nthe Swiss pension plan has the responsibility to set the conver-\nsion rates for the plan. In December 2016, the Board of Trustees \nof the Swiss pension plan decided in favor of further decreases in \nconversion rates. In the future, decisions on conversion rates will \nbe set for a planning horizon of at least eight years.\n\nInternational pension plans\nVarious defined benefit pension plans cover the Group\xe2\x80\x99s employ-\nees outside Switzerland. These plans provide benefits in the \nevent of retirement, death, disability or termination of employ-\nment. Retirement benefits under the international pension plans \ndepend on age, contributions and salary. The Group\xe2\x80\x99s principal \ndefined benefit pension plans outside Switzerland are located in \nthe US and in the UK. Both of these plans are funded, closed to \nnew participants and have ceased accruing new benefits. Smaller \ndefined benefit pension plans, both funded and unfunded, are \noperated in other locations.\n\nOther post-retirement defined benefit plans\nIn the US, the Group\xe2\x80\x99s defined benefit plans provide post-retire-\nment benefits other than pension benefits that primarily focus \non health and welfare benefits for certain retired employees. In \nexchange for the current services provided by the employee, the \nGroup promises to provide health and welfare benefits after the \nemployee retires. The Group\xe2\x80\x99s obligation for that compensation \nis incurred as employees render the services necessary to earn \ntheir post-retirement benefits.\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n329\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nComponents of net periodic benefit costs\n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \nin\xc2\xa0 \n\n       \n\n                   \n                   \n\n2018   \n\n2017   \n\nSwitzerland   \n2016   \n\n       \n\n2018   \n\nDefined benefit   \npension plans   \nInternational   \n2016   \n\n2017   \n\n       \n       \n\n       \n\n2018   \n\nOther post-retirement  \ndefined benefit plans \nInternational \n2016 \n\n2017   \n\nNet periodic benefit costs (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nService costs on benefit obligation\xc2\xa0 \nInterest costs on benefit obligation\xc2\xa0 \nExpected return on plan assets\xc2\xa0 \nAmortization of recognized prior service cost/(credit)\xc2\xa0 \nAmortization of recognized actuarial losses/(gains)\xc2\xa0 \nSettlement losses/(gains)\xc2\xa0 \nCurtailment losses/(gains)\xc2\xa0 \nSpecial termination benefits\xc2\xa0 \nNet periodic benefit costs/(credits)\xc2\xa0 \n\n242   \n63   \n(483)   \n(126)   \n306   \n35   \n(12)   \n38   \n63   \n\n243   \n57   \n(473)   \n(131)   \n340   \n37   \n(23)   \n19   \n69   \n\n288   \n141   \n(536)   \n(116)   \n366   \n24   \n(18)   \n22   \n171   \n\n16   \n86   \n(114)   \n0   \n47   \n0   \n(1)   \n0   \n34   \n\n22   \n91   \n(133)   \n0   \n60   \n0   \n(10)   \n0   \n30   \n\n20   \n124   \n(175)   \n0   \n41   \n72   \n0   \n0   \n82   \n\n0   \n5   \n0   \n0   \n8   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n13   \n\n0   \n6   \n0   \n0   \n7   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n13   \n\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n0 \n8 \n0 \n0 \n10 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n18 \n\nNet periodic benefit costs of defined benefit plans\nThe net periodic benefit costs for defined benefit pension and \nother post-retirement defined benefit plans are the costs of the \nrespective plan for a period during which an employee renders \nservices. The actual amount to be recognized is determined using \nthe standard actuarial methodology which considers, among other \nfactors, current service cost, interest cost, expected return on \nplan assets and the amortization of both prior service cost/(credit) \nand actuarial losses/(gains) recognized in AOCI.\n\nService costs on benefit obligation reflected in compensation and \nbenefits \xe2\x80\x93 other for 2018, 2017 and 2016 were CHF\xc2\xa0258 million, \nCHF\xc2\xa0265 million and CHF\xc2\xa0308 million, respectively.\n\nSince the second quarter of 2011, as part of its strategic plan, \nthe Group has launched a number of cost efficiency measures, \nincluding headcount reduction. This resulted in curtailment gains \nof CHF\xc2\xa012 million, CHF\xc2\xa023 million and CHF\xc2\xa018 million in 2018, \n2017 and 2016, respectively, reflecting the immediate recognition \nof a credit relating to the years of service no longer expected to \nbe rendered. Additional costs of CHF\xc2\xa035 million, CHF\xc2\xa037 million \nand CHF\xc2\xa024 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, related \nto the settlement of the pension obligation for employees in Swit-\nzerland whose employment has effectively been terminated or \nwho have left the Group due to a sale of their business. Special \ntermination benefit costs of CHF\xc2\xa038 million, CHF\xc2\xa019 million and \nCHF\xc2\xa022 million have been recognized in 2018, 2017 and 2016, \nrespectively, relating to early retirements in Switzerland in the \ncontext of the cost efficiency measures.\n\nDuring the second half of 2016, lump-sum settlement offers \nwere made to terminated vested members of the pension fund in \nthe US. As a result of members accepting this offer, there was \nan additional cost of CHF\xc2\xa072 million relating to the settlement of \npension obligations for these members.\n\nBenefit obligation\nThe benefit obligation is expressed as either accumulated benefit \nobligation (ABO) or PBO. While the ABO refers to the actuarial \n\n330\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\npresent value based on employee services rendered prior to that date \nand takes into account current and past compensation levels, the \nPBO also applies an assumption as to future compensation levels.\n\nThe table \xe2\x80\x9cObligations and funded status of the plans\xe2\x80\x9d shows the \nchanges in the PBO, the ABO, the fair value of plan assets and \nthe amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets for \nthe defined benefit pension and other post-retirement defined \nbenefit plans.\n\nUS GAAP requires an employer to recognize the funded status \nof the defined benefit pension and other post-retirement defined \nbenefit plans on the balance sheet. The funded status of these \nplans is determined as the difference between the fair value of \nplan assets and the PBO. The funded status may vary from year \nto year due to changes in the fair value of plan assets and varia-\ntions of the PBO following changes in the underlying assumptions \nand census data used to determine the PBO. In 2018 and 2017, \nthe curtailments, settlements and special termination benefits in \nSwitzerland, which impacted the PBO, related to the headcount \nreduction in the context of the cost efficiency measures.\n\nEffective January\xc2\xa01, 2017, the Board of Trustees of the Swiss \npension plan changed a number of retirement benefits, reflect-\ning the plan\xe2\x80\x99s ability to finance benefits on an ongoing long-term \nbasis. These changes reflected the prospective higher costs of \nproviding retirement benefits due to lower expected asset returns, \nlower interest rates and increased life expectancy. These con-\nsiderations have resulted in incremental reductions of conversion \nrates, the introduction of the reference age 65 for all insured per-\nsons, changes to the bridging pension related to the Swiss Old-\nAge and Survivors Insurance, enhanced lump-sum withdrawal \noptions on retirement and the reduction of the maximum retire-\nment pension. Furthermore, the Board of Trustees of the Swiss \npension plan also agreed to improve death and disability benefits \nand to introduce a cohabiting partner\xe2\x80\x99s pension. \n\n\x0c \n\n

In countries where \nthere is no deep market in high-quality corporate bonds with \nlonger durations, the best available market information, including \ngovernmental bond yields and risk premiums, is used to construct \nthe yield curve. Credit Suisse adopted the spot rate approach for \nthe valuation as of December\xc2\xa031, 2016, whereby individual spot \nrates on the yield curve are applied to each year\xe2\x80\x99s cash flow in \nmeasuring the plan\xe2\x80\x99s benefit obligation as well as future service \ncosts and interest costs.\n\nThe assumption pertaining to salary increases is used to calculate \nthe PBO, which is measured using an assumption as to future \ncompensation levels.\n\nWhen Credit Suisse estimates the interest rate on savings bal-\nances, expected future changes in the interest rate environment \nare taken into consideration. Specifically, Credit Suisse uses the \ncash flow weighted average of the yield curve used for the dis-\ncount rate as the best estimate for the interest rate on savings \nbalances for these long term projections.\n\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption \nis applied to the market-related value of assets to calculate the \nexpected return on plan assets as a component of the net peri-\nodic benefit costs. It reflects the average rate of returns expected \non the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits \nincluded in the PBO. In estimating that rate, appropriate consider-\nation is given to the returns being earned by the plan assets and \nthe rates of return expected to be available for reinvestment. The \nexpected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on total \nreturn forecasts, expected volatility and correlation estimates, \nreflecting interrelationships between and within asset classes \nheld. Where possible, similar, if not related, approaches are fol-\nlowed to forecast returns for the various asset classes.\n\nThe expected long-term rate of return on debt securities reflects \nboth accruing interest and price returns. The probable long-term \nrelationship between the total return and certain exogenous vari-\nables is used, which links the total return forecasts on debt secu-\nrities to forecasts of the macroeconomic environment.\n\nThe expected long-term rate of ROE securities is based on a \ntwo-stage dividend discount model which considers economic \nand market forecasts to compute a market-implied equity risk \npremium. Dividends are estimated using market consensus earn-\nings and the historical payout ratio. A subsequent scenario analy-\nsis is used to stress test the level of the return.\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n333\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nThe expected long-term rate of return on real estate is based \non economic models that reflect both the rental and the capital \nmarket side of the direct real estate market. This allows for a rep-\nlicable and robust forecasting methodology for expected returns \non real estate equity, fund and direct market indices.\n\nThe expected long-term rate of return on private equity and \nhedge funds is estimated by determining the key factors in their \n\nhistorical performance using private equity and hedge fund \nbenchmarks and indices. To capture these factors, multiple linear \nregression models with lagged returns are used.\n\nMortality assumptions are based on standard mortality tables \nand standard models and methodologies for projecting future \nimprovements to mortality as developed and published by external \nindependent actuarial societies and actuarial organizations.\n\nMortality tables and life expectancies for major plans\n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \nDecember 31\xc2\xa0 \n\n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\n   \n   \n\n   \n   \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n   \n2018   \n\nLife expectancy at age 65               \nfor a male member currently               \n\naged 65   \n2017   \n\n   \n2018   \n\naged 45   \n2017   \n\nLife expectancy (years)\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSwitzerland\xc2\xa0 \nUK\xc2\xa0 \nUS\xc2\xa0 \n\nBVG 2015 tables\xc2\xa01 \nSAPS S2 light tables\xc2\xa02 \nRP-2014 mortality tables\xc2\xa03 \n\n21.6   \n23.7   \n21.5   \n\n21.6   \n23.8   \n21.5   \n\n23.2   \n25.3   \n22.7   \n\n23.1   \n25.4   \n22.7   \n\nLife expectancy at age 65  \nfor a female member currently \naged 45 \n2017 \n\n   \n2018   \n\naged 65   \n2017   \n\n23.5   \n24.8   \n23.3   \n\n25.1   \n26.5   \n24.5   \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n25.1 \n26.6 \n24.4 \n\n   \n2018   \n\n23.6   \n24.8   \n23.4   \n\n1 The BVG 2015 tables were used, which included final CMI projections, with a long-term rate of improvement of 1.25% per annum.\n2 95% of Self-Administered Pension Scheme (SAPS) S2 light tables were used, which included final CMI projections, with a long-term rate of improvement of 1.5% per annum.\n3 The Retirement Projection 2014 (RP-2014) mortality tables were used, with projections based on the Social Security Administration\xe2\x80\x99s intermediate improvement scale.\n\nUnder US GAAP, the assumptions used to value the PBO should \nalways represent the best estimate as of the measurement date. \nCredit Suisse regularly reviews the actuarial assumptions used \nto value and measure the defined benefit obligation on a periodic \nbasis as required by US GAAP.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cCritical accounting estimates\xe2\x80\x9d in II \xe2\x80\x93 Operating and financial \n\nreview and \xe2\x80\x9cNote 1- Summary of significant accounting policies\xe2\x80\x9d for further \ninformation.\n\nevery five years. Credit Suisse incorporates future improve-\nments in life expectancy on a continuous basis by apply-\ning future expected improvements to the periodic BVG 2015 \ntables using the Continuous Mortality Investigation (CMI) \nmodel with a long-term improvement rate of 1.25%. As part of \nits review during 2017, Credit Suisse adopted the final version \nof the CMI model as published in early 2017 for the valuation \nof the Swiss pension plan. This resulted in an increase in the \nPBO of CHF\xc2\xa0140 million in 2017.\n\nReview of assumptions\nAs part of its reviews in 2016, 2017 and 2018, Credit Suisse \nconcluded that additional refinements to the assumptions for the \nSwiss pension plan were required in order to reflect the best esti-\nmate. As a result, Credit Suisse enhanced its methodology for \ndetermining the actuarial assumptions for the Swiss pension plan \nas follows:\np  For estimating the discount rates used for discounting \n\np  In setting the assumption for the future interest rate on sav-\n\nings balances and future conversion rates, management took \ninto consideration the expected level of future interest rates \nbased on the yield curve used for the discount rate in addition \nto the legal minimum requirements, current rates approved by \nthe Board of Trustees of the Swiss pension fund and historical \ntrends.\n\np  For discounting expected future cash flows, Credit Suisse \n\nexpected future cash flows when valuing the PBO, Credit \nSuisse introduced a more standardized approach for setting \nthis assumption and improved the construction of the yield \ncurve where the market for high-quality Swiss corporate bonds \nwith long-term maturities was not sufficiently deep. The indi-\nvidual spot rates on the yield curve were applied for discount-\ning each respective year\xe2\x80\x99s cash flow in measuring the Swiss \npension plan\xe2\x80\x99s benefit obligation as of December 31, 2016.\n\np  In Switzerland, the mortality tables used for the occupational \n\npension fund are the BVG series, which are currently reviewed \n\nadopted the \xe2\x80\x9cspot rate approach\xe2\x80\x9d for the valuation as of \nDecember 31, 2016, whereby individual spot rates on the \nyield curve are applied to each year\xe2\x80\x99s cash flow in measur-\ning the plan\xe2\x80\x99s benefit obligation as well as future service costs \nand interest costs. Under the previous methodology, a single \nweighted-average discount rate derived from the yield curve \nwas applied to each cash flow. Incorporating the \xe2\x80\x9cspot rate \napproach\xe2\x80\x9d reduced the 2017 net periodic benefit costs by \nCHF\xc2\xa087 million as compared to the prior methodology.\n\n334\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nHealth care cost assumptions\nThe health care cost trend is used to determine the appropriate \nother post-retirement defined benefit costs.

The intent of \nthis strategy is to meet or outperform plan liabilities over the long \nterm. Risk tolerance is established through careful consider-\nation of plan liabilities, plan funded status and corporate financial \ncondition. Furthermore, equity securities are diversified across \ndifferent geographic regions as well as across growth, value and \nsmall and large capitalization stocks. Real estate and alternative \ninvestments, such as private equity and hedge funds, are used \nto enhance long-term returns while improving portfolio diversi-\nfication. Derivatives may be used to hedge or increase market \n\nexposure, but are not used to leverage the portfolio beyond the \nmarket value of the underlying investments. Investment risk is \nmeasured and monitored on an ongoing basis through periodic \nasset/liability studies and quarterly investment portfolio reviews. \nTo limit investment risk, the Group pension plans follow defined \nstrategic asset allocation guidelines. At times of major mar-\nket uncertainties and stress, these guidelines may be further \nrestricted.\n\nAs of December\xc2\xa031, 2018 and 2017, the total fair value of Group \nequity securities and options was CHF\xc2\xa076 million and CHF\xc2\xa0118 \nmillion, respectively.\n\nFair value hierarchy of plan assets\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cFair value measurement\xe2\x80\x9d in Note\xc2\xa035 \xe2\x80\x93 Financial instruments for dis-\n\ncussion of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nFair value of plan assets\nThe following tables present the plan assets measured at fair \nvalue on a recurring basis as of December\xc2\xa031, 2018 and 2017 for \nthe Group\xe2\x80\x99s defined benefit pension plans.\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n335\n\n\x0c \n\nPlan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis\nend of\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \nLevel 1   \n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \nLevel 2   \n\n   \n   \n   \nAssets   \n    measured   \n    at net asset   \nvalue   \n   \nLevel 3   \nper share   \n\nPlan assets at fair value (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCash and cash equivalents\xc2\xa0 \nDebt securities\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which corporates\xc2\xa0 \nEquity securities\xc2\xa0 \nReal estate\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which direct\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which indirect\xc2\xa0 \nAlternative investments\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which private equity\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which hedge funds\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which other\xc2\xa0 \nSwitzerland\xc2\xa0 \nCash and cash equivalents\xc2\xa0 \nDebt securities\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which governments\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which corporates\xc2\xa0 \nEquity securities\xc2\xa0 \nReal estate \xe2\x80\x93 indirect\xc2\xa0 \nAlternative investments\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which hedge funds\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which other\xc2\xa0 \nOther investments\xc2\xa0 \nInternational\xc2\xa0 \nTotal plan assets at fair value\xc2\xa0 \n\n763   \n3,742   \n3,742   \n5,113   \n875   \n0   \n875   \n704   \n0   \n356   \n348   \n11,197   \n86   \n1,889   \n1,574   \n315   \n52   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n2,027   \n13,224   \n\n0   \n150   \n150   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n24   \n0   \n0   \n24   \n174   \n123   \n846   \n5   \n841   \n12   \n0   \n19   \n0   \n19   1 \n85   \n1,085   \n1,259   \n\n0   \n34   \n34   \n0   \n1,345   \n1,297   \n48   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n1,379   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n1,379   \n\n0   \n751   \n751   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n2,724   \n1,503   \n762   \n459   \n3,475   \n0   \n328   \n0   \n328   \n74   \n29   \n61   \n61   \n0   \n0   \n492   \n3,967   \n\n \n\n \n\n2017 \n \n \n \n \nTotal \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n384 \n4,248 \n4,248 \n6,790 \n1,984 \n1,244 \n740 \n3,590 \n1,313 \n1,445 \n832 \n16,996 \n203 \n3,441 \n1,631 \n1,810 \n216 \n27 \n109 \n76 \n33 \n92 \n4,088 \n21,084 \n\n2018   \n   \n   \n   \n   \nTotal   \n\n763   \n4,677   \n4,677   \n5,113   \n2,220   \n1,297   \n923   \n3,452   \n1,503   \n1,118   \n831   \n16,225   \n209   \n3,063   \n1,579   \n1,484   \n138   \n29   \n80   \n61   \n19   \n85   \n3,604   \n19,829   \n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \nLevel 1   \n\n384   \n3,144   \n3,144   \n6,780   \n727   \n0   \n727   \n513   \n0   \n153   \n360   \n11,548   \n70   \n1,991   \n1,622   \n369   \n55   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n2,116   \n13,664   \n\n   \n   \n   \n   \n   \nLevel 2   \n\n   \n   \n   \nAssets   \n    measured   \n    at net asset   \nvalue   \n   \nLevel 3   \nper share   \n\n0   \n325   \n325   \n10   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n14   \n0   \n0   \n14   \n349   \n133   \n1,080   \n9   \n1,071   \n14   \n0   \n33   \n0   \n33   1 \n92   \n1,352   \n1,701   \n\n0   \n37   \n37   \n0   \n1,257   \n1,244   \n13   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n1,294   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n1,294   \n\n0   \n742   \n742   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n3,063   \n1,313   \n1,292   \n458   \n3,805   \n0   \n370   \n0   \n370   \n147   \n27   \n76   \n76   \n0   \n0   \n620   \n4,425   \n\nThe Swiss pension fund uses exchange-traded futures to manage the economic exposure of the portfolio.

The \navailability of information used in these modeling techniques is \noften limited and involves significant judgment in evaluating these \ndifferent factors over time. Real estate investment companies, \ntrusts and mutual funds, which are not directly quoted on a public \nstock exchange and/or for which a fair value is not readily deter-\nminable, are measured at fair value using NAV.\n\nAlternative investments\nPrivate equity includes direct investments, investments in partner-\nships that make private equity and related investments in various \nportfolio companies and funds and fund of funds partnerships. \nPrivate equity consists of both publicly traded securities and pri-\nvate securities. Publicly traded investments that are restricted or \nthat are not quoted in active markets are valued based on pub-\nlicly available quotes with appropriate adjustments for liquidity or \ntrading restrictions. Private equity is valued taking into account \na number of factors, such as the most recent round of financ-\ning involving unrelated new investors, earnings multiple analyses \nusing comparable companies or discounted cash flow analyses. \nPrivate equity for which a fair value is not readily determinable is \nmeasured at fair value using NAV provided by the general partner.\n\nHedge funds that are not directly quoted on a public stock \nexchange, and/or for which a fair value is not readily determin-\nable, are measured at fair value using NAV provided by the fund \nadministrator.\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n337\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nThe following table shows the target plan asset allocation for \n2019 in accordance with the Group\xe2\x80\x99s investment strategy.

The determination \nof the fair value of many derivatives involves only a limited degree \nof subjectivity since the required inputs are generally observ-\nable in the marketplace. Other more complex derivatives may \nuse unobservable inputs. Such inputs include long-dated volatil-\nity assumptions on OTC option transactions and recovery rate \nassumptions for credit derivative transactions. The fair value of \nexchange-traded derivatives is typically derived from the observ-\nable exchange prices and/or observable inputs.\n\nPlan asset allocation\nThe following table shows the plan asset allocation as of the \nmeasurement date calculated based on the fair value at that date \nincluding the performance of each asset class.\n\nPlan asset allocation\n\xc2\xa0 \nDecember 31\xc2\xa0 \n\n \n\nWeighted-average (%)\xc2\xa0 \n \nCash and cash equivalents\xc2\xa0 \nDebt securities\xc2\xa0 \nEquity securities\xc2\xa0 \nReal estate\xc2\xa0 \nAlternative investments\xc2\xa0 \nInsurance\xc2\xa0 \nTotal\xc2\xa0 \n\n  \n\nSwitzerland      \n\n2018  \n\n2017  \n\n2018   \n\nInternational \n2017 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n4.7  \n28.8  \n31.5  \n13.7  \n21.3  \n0.0  \n100.0  \n\n2.3  \n25.0  \n39.9  \n11.7  \n21.1  \n0.0  \n100.0  \n\n5.8   \n85.0   \n3.8   \n0.8   \n2.2   \n2.4   \n100.0   \n\n5.0 \n84.0 \n5.3 \n0.7 \n2.7 \n2.3 \n100.0 \n\n338\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\n32  Derivatives and hedging activities\n\nDerivatives are generally either privately negotiated OTC contracts \nor standard contracts transacted through regulated exchanges. \nThe Group\xe2\x80\x99s most frequently used freestanding derivative prod-\nucts, entered into for trading and risk management purposes, \ninclude interest rate, credit default and cross-currency swaps, \ninterest rate and foreign exchange options, foreign exchange for-\nward contracts and foreign exchange and interest rate futures.\n\nThe Group also enters into contracts that are not considered \nderivatives in their entirety but include embedded derivative fea-\ntures. Such transactions primarily include issued and purchased \nstructured debt instruments where the return may be calculated \nby reference to an equity security, index or third-party credit risk, \nor that have non-standard interest or foreign exchange terms.\n\nOn the date a derivative contract is entered into, the Group desig-\nnates it as belonging to one of the following categories:\np  trading activities;\np  a risk management transaction that does not qualify as a \n\nhedge under accounting standards (referred to as an economic \nhedge);\n\np  a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability;\np  a hedge of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid \nrelating to a recognized asset or liability or a forecasted trans-\naction; or\n\np  a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation.\n\nTrading activities\n\nThe Group is active in most of the principal trading markets and \ntransacts in many trading and hedging products. As noted above, \nthis includes the use of swaps, futures, options and structured \nproducts, such as custom transactions using combinations of \nderivatives, in connection with its sales and trading activities. \nTrading activities include market making, positioning and arbitrage \nactivities. The majority of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s derivatives were used for \ntrading activities.\n\nEconomic hedges\n\nEconomic hedges arise when the Group enters into derivative \ncontracts for its own risk management purposes, but the con-\ntracts entered into do not qualify for hedge accounting under US \nGAAP. These economic hedges include the following types:\np  interest rate derivatives to manage net interest rate risk on \n\ncertain core banking business assets and liabilities;\n\np  foreign exchange derivatives to manage foreign exchange risk \non certain core banking business revenue and expense items, \nas well as on core banking business assets and liabilities;\n\np  credit derivatives to manage credit risk on certain loan \n\nportfolios; \n\np  futures to manage risk on equity positions including convertible \n\nbonds; and\n\np  equity derivatives to manage equity/index risks on certain \n\nstructured products.\n\nDerivatives used in economic hedges are included as trading \nassets or trading liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nHedge accounting\n\nFair value hedges\nThe Group designates fair value hedges as part of an over-\nall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the \nuse of derivative instruments to minimize fluctuations in earnings \nthat are caused by interest rate volatility. In addition to hedging \nchanges in fair value due to interest rate risk associated with fixed \nrate loans, repurchase agreements and long-term debt instru-\nments, the Group uses:\np  cross-currency swaps to convert foreign-currency-denomi-\n\nnated fixed rate assets or liabilities to floating rate functional \ncurrency assets or liabilities; and\n\np  foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge the foreign \nexchange risk associated with available-for-sale securities.\n\nCash flow hedges\nThe Group designates cash flow hedges as part of its strategy to \nmitigate its risk to variability of cash flows on loans, deposits and \nother debt obligations by using interest rate swaps to convert vari-\nable rate assets or liabilities to fixed rates. The Group also uses \ncross-currency swaps to convert foreign-currency-denominated \nfixed and floating rate assets or liabilities to fixed rate assets or \nliabilities based on the currency profile to which the Group elects \nto be exposed. This includes, but is not limited to, Swiss francs \nand US dollars. Further, the Group uses derivatives to hedge its \ncash flows associated with forecasted transactions. As of the \nend of 2018, the maximum length of time over which the Group \nhedged its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for \nforecasted transactions, excluding those forecasted transactions \nrelated to the payment of variable interest on existing financial \ninstruments, was five years.\n\nNet investment hedges \nThe Group designates net investment hedges as part of its strat-\negy to hedge selected net investments in foreign operations \nagainst adverse movements in foreign exchange rates, typically \nusing forward foreign exchange contracts.\n\nHedge effectiveness assessment\nThe Group assesses the effectiveness of hedging relationships \nboth prospectively and retrospectively. The prospective assess-\nment is made both at the inception of a hedging relationship and \non an ongoing basis, and requires the Group to justify its expec-\ntation that the relationship will be highly effective over future peri-\nods. The retrospective assessment is also performed on an ongo-\ning basis and requires the Group to determine whether or not the \nhedging relationship has actually been effective. If the Group con-\ncludes, through a retrospective evaluation, that hedge accounting \nis appropriate for the current period, then it measures the amount \nof hedge ineffectiveness to be recognized in earnings.\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n339\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nFair value of derivative instruments\n\nThe tables below present gross derivative replacement values by \ntype of contract and whether the derivative is used for trading \npurposes or in a qualifying hedging relationship. Notional amounts \nhave also been provided as an indication of the volume of deriva-\ntive activity within the Group.\n\nInformation on bifurcated embedded derivatives has not been \nincluded in these tables. Under US GAAP, the Group elected to \naccount for substantially all financial instruments with an embed-\nded derivative that is not considered clearly and closely related to \nthe host contract at

of \nthe major credit rating agencies. If the ratings fall below the level \nspecified in the contract, the counterparties to the agreements \ncould request payment of additional collateral on those derivative \ninstruments that are in a net liability position. Certain of the deriv-\native contracts also provide for termination of the contract, gener-\nally upon a downgrade of either the Group or the counterparty. \nSuch derivative contracts are reflected at close-out costs.\n\nThe following table provides the Group\xe2\x80\x99s current net exposure \nfrom contingent credit risk relating to derivative contracts with \nbilateral counterparties and SPEs that include credit support \nagreements, the related collateral posted and the additional col-\nlateral required in a one-notch, two-notch and a three-notch \ndowngrade event, respectively. The table also includes deriva-\ntive contracts with contingent credit risk features without credit \nsupport agreements that have accelerated termination event \nconditions. The current net exposure for derivative contracts with \nbilateral counterparties and contracts with accelerated termination \nevent conditions is the aggregate fair value of derivative instru-\nments that were in a net liability position. For SPEs, the current \nnet exposure is the contractual amount that is used to determine \nthe collateral payable in the event of a downgrade. The contrac-\ntual amount could include both the NRV and a percentage of the \nnotional value of the derivative.\n\nRepresents gains/(losses) on effective portion.\n\nContingent credit risk\n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \nend of\xc2\xa0 \n\nContingent credit risk (CHF billion)\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \nCurrent net exposure\xc2\xa0 \nCollateral posted\xc2\xa0 \nImpact of a one-notch downgrade event\xc2\xa0 \nImpact of a two-notch downgrade event\xc2\xa0 \nImpact of a three-notch downgrade event\xc2\xa0 \n\n           \n   \nBilateral   \ncounterparties   \n\nSpecial   \n   \npurpose    Accelerated   \nentities    terminations   \n\n2018   \n   \n   \n\n           \n   \nBilateral   \nTotal   counterparties  \n\nSpecial   \n   \npurpose    Accelerated   \nentities    terminations   \n\n3.6   \n3.4   \n0.2   \n0.9   \n1.0   \n\n0.1   \n0.1   \n0.0   \n0.0   \n0.1   \n\n0.3   \n\xe2\x80\x93   \n0.0   \n0.1   \n0.2   \n\n4.0   \n3.5   \n0.2   \n1.0   \n1.3   \n\n5.4   \n4.4   \n0.2   \n0.9   \n1.0   \n\n0.1   \n0.1   \n0.1   \n0.2   \n0.4   \n\n1.2   \n\xe2\x80\x93   \n0.1   \n0.5   \n0.7   \n\n       \n \n\n2017 \n \n \nTotal \n\n \n \n \n \n6.7 \n4.5 \n0.4 \n1.6 \n2.1 \n\nThe impact of a downgrade event reflects the amount of additional collateral required for bilateral counterparties and special purpose entities and the amount of additional termination \nexpenses for accelerated terminations, respectively.\n\nCredit derivatives\n\nCredit derivatives are contractual agreements in which the buyer \ngenerally pays a fee in exchange for a contingent payment by the \nseller if there is a credit event on the underlying referenced entity \nor asset. They are generally privately negotiated OTC contracts, \nwith numerous settlement and payment terms, and most are \nstructured so that they specify the occurrence of an identifiable \n\n342\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\ncredit event, which can include bankruptcy, insolvency, receiver-\nship, material adverse restructuring of debt or failure to meet obli-\ngations when due.\n\nThe Group enters into credit derivative contracts in the normal \ncourse of business, buying and selling protection to facilitate cli-\nent transactions and as a market maker. This includes providing \nstructured credit products for its clients to enable them to hedge \n\n\x0c \n\n \n\ntheir credit risk. The referenced instruments of these structured \ncredit products are both investment grade and non-investment \ngrade and could include corporate bonds, sovereign debt, ABS \nand loans. These instruments can be formed as single items (sin-\ngle-named instruments) or combined on a portfolio basis (multi-\nnamed instruments). The Group purchases protection to eco-\nnomically hedge various forms of credit exposure, for example, \nthe economic hedging of loan portfolios or other cash positions. \nFinally, the Group also takes proprietary positions which can take \nthe form of either purchased or sold protection.\n\nThe credit derivatives most commonly transacted by the Group \nare CDS and credit swaptions. CDSs are contractual agreements \nin which the buyer of the swap pays an upfront and/or a periodic \nfee in return for a contingent payment by the seller of the swap \nfollowing a credit event of the referenced entity or asset. Credit \nswaptions are options with a specified maturity to buy or sell pro-\ntection under a CDS on a specific referenced credit event.\n\nIn addition, to reduce its credit risk, the Group enters into legally \nenforceable netting agreements with its derivative counterparties. \nCollateral on these derivative contracts is usually posted on a net \ncounterparty basis and cannot be allocated to a particular deriva-\ntive contract.\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cNote 27 \xe2\x80\x93 Offsetting of financial assets and financial liabilities\xe2\x80\x9d for \n\nfurther information on netting.\n\nCredit protection sold\nCredit protection sold is the maximum potential payout, which \nis based on the notional value of derivatives and represents the \namount of future payments that the Group would be required to \nmake as a result of credit risk-related events. The Group believes \nthat the maximum potential payout is not representative of the \nactual loss exposure based on historical experience. This amount \nhas not been reduced by the Group\xe2\x80\x99s rights to the underlying \nassets and the related cash flows. In accordance with most credit \nderivative contracts, should a credit event (or settlement trigger) \noccur, the Group is usually liable for the difference between the \ncredit protection sold and the recourse it holds in the value of \nthe underlying assets. The maximum potential amount of future \npayments has not been reduced for any cash collateral paid to a \ngiven counterparty as such payments would be calculated after \nnetting all derivative exposures, including any credit derivatives \nwith that counterparty in accordance with a related master net-\nting agreement. Due to such netting processes, determining the \namount of collateral that corresponds to credit derivative expo-\nsures only is not possible.\n\nTo reflect the quality of the payment risk on credit protection sold, \nthe Group assigns an internally generated rating to those instru-\nments referenced in the contracts. Internal ratings are assigned \nby experienced credit analysts based on expert judgment that \nincorporates analysis and evaluation of both quantitative and \nqualitative factors. The specific factors analyzed, and their rela-\ntive importance, are dependent on the type of counterparty. The \n\nanalysis emphasizes a forward-looking approach, concentrat-\ning on economic trends and financial fundamentals, and making \nuse of peer analysis, industry comparisons and other quantitative \ntools. External ratings and market information are also used in the \nanalysis process where available.\n\nCredit protection purchased\nCredit protection purchased represents those instruments where \nthe underlying reference instrument is identical to the reference \ninstrument of the credit protection sold. The maximum potential \npayout amount of credit protection purchased for each individual \nidentical underlying reference instrument may be greater or lower \nthan the notional amount of protection sold.\n\nThe Group also considers estimated recoveries that it would \nreceive if the specified credit event occurred, including both the \nanticipated value of the underlying referenced asset that would, \nin most instances, be transferred to the Group and the impact of \nany purchased protection with an identical reference instrument \nand product type.\n\nOther protection purchased\nIn the normal course of business, the Group purchases protection \nto offset the risk of credit protection sold that may have similar, \nbut not identical, reference instruments, and may use similar, but \nnot identical, products, which reduces the total credit derivative \nexposure. Other protection purchased is based on the notional \nvalue of the instruments.\n\nThe Group purchases its protection from banks and broker deal-\ners, other financial institutions and other counterparties.\n\nFair value of credit protection sold\nThe fair values of the credit protection sold give an indication of \nthe amount of payment risk, as the negative fair values increase \nwhen the potential payment under the derivative contracts \nbecomes more probable.\n\nCredit protection sold/purchased\nThe following tables do not include all credit derivatives and dif-\nfer from the credit derivatives in the \xe2\x80\x9cFair value of derivative \ninstruments\xe2\x80\x9d table. This is due to the exclusion of certain credit \nderivative instruments under US GAAP, which defines a credit \nderivative as a derivative instrument (a) in which one or more of its \nunderlyings are related to the credit risk of a specified entity (or a \ngroup of entities) or an index based on the credit risk of a group \nof entities and (b) that exposes the seller to potential loss from \ncredit risk-related events specified in the contract. \n\nTotal return swaps (TRS) of CHF\xc2\xa09.7 billion and CHF\xc2\xa06.7 bil-\nlion as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, were also \nexcluded because a TRS does not expose the seller to potential \nloss from credit risk-related events specified in the contract. A \nTRS only provides protection against a loss in asset value and not \nagainst additional amounts as a result of specific credit events.\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit

The position \nincludes standby letters of credit, commercial and residential \nmortgage guarantees and other guarantees associated with VIEs.\n\nStandby letters of credit are made in connection with the cor-\nporate lending business and other corporate activities, where \nthe Group provides guarantees to counterparties in the form of \nstandby letters of credit, which represent obligations to make \npayments to third parties if the counterparties fail to fulfill their \nobligations under a borrowing arrangement or other contractual \nobligation.\n\nCommercial and residential mortgage guarantees are made in \nconnection with the Group\xe2\x80\x99s commercial mortgage activities in \nthe US, where the Group sells certain commercial and residen-\ntial mortgages to Fannie Mae and agrees to bear a percentage \nof the losses triggered by the borrowers failing to perform on the \nmortgage. The Group also issues guarantees that require it to \nreimburse Fannie Mae for losses on certain whole loans underly-\ning mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, which \n\nare triggered by borrowers failing to perform on the underlying \nmortgages.\n\nThe Group also provides guarantees to VIEs and other counter-\nparties under which it may be required to buy assets from such \nentities upon the occurrence of certain triggering events such as \nrating downgrades and/or substantial decreases in the fair value \nof those assets.\n\nPerformance guarantees and similar instruments\nPerformance guarantees and similar instruments are arrange-\nments that require contingent payments to be made when certain \nperformance-related targets or covenants are not met. Such \ncovenants may include a customer\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to deliver certain \nproducts and services or to perform under a construction con-\ntract. Performance guarantees are frequently executed as part of \nproject finance transactions. The position includes private equity \nfund guarantees and guarantees related to residential mortgage \nsecuritization activities.\n\nFor private equity fund guarantees, the Group has provided inves-\ntors in private equity funds sponsored by a Group entity guaran-\ntees on potential obligations of certain general partners to return \n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n345\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\namounts previously paid as carried interest to those general part-\nners if the performance of the remaining investments declines. To \nmanage its exposure, the Group generally withholds a portion of \ncarried interest distributions to cover any repayment obligations. \nIn addition, pursuant to certain contractual arrangements, the \nGroup is obligated to make cash payments to certain investors in \ncertain private equity funds if specified performance thresholds \nare not met.\n\nFurther, as part of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s residential mortgage securitiza-\ntion activities in the US, the Group may guarantee the collection \nby the servicer and remittance to the securitization trust of pre-\npayment penalties. The Group will have to perform under these \nguarantees in the event the servicer fails to remit the prepayment \npenalties.\n\nDerivatives\nDerivatives which may also have the characteristics of a guaran-\ntee are issued in the ordinary course of business, generally in the \nform of written put options. Such derivative contracts do not meet \nthe characteristics of a guarantee if they are cash settled and the \nGroup has no basis to conclude it is probable that the counter-\nparties held, at inception, the underlying instruments related to \nthe derivative contracts. The Group has concluded that these \nconditions were met for certain active commercial and invest-\nment banks and certain other counterparties, and accordingly, the \nGroup has reported such contracts as derivatives only.\n\nThe Group manages its exposure to these derivatives by engag-\ning in various hedging strategies to reduce its exposure. For some \ncontracts, such as written interest rate caps or foreign exchange \noptions, the maximum payout is not determinable as interest rates \nor exchange rates could theoretically rise without limit. For these \ncontracts, notional amounts were disclosed in the table above \nin order to provide an indication of the underlying exposure. In \naddition, the Group carries all derivatives at fair value in the con-\nsolidated balance sheets and has considered the performance \ntriggers and probabilities of payment when determining those fair \nvalues. It is more likely than not that written put options that are \nin-the-money to the counterparty will be exercised, for which the \nGroup\xe2\x80\x99s exposure was limited to the carrying value reflected in the \ntable.\n\nOther guarantees\nOther guarantees include bankers\xe2\x80\x99 acceptances, residual value \nguarantees, deposit insurance, contingent considerations in busi-\nness combinations, the minimum value of an investment in mutual \nfunds or private equity funds and all other guarantees that were \nnot allocated to one of the categories above.\n\nDeposit-taking banks and securities dealers in Switzerland and \ncertain other European countries are required to ensure the \npayout of privileged deposits in case of specified restrictions or \ncompulsory liquidation of a deposit-taking bank. In Switzerland, \ndeposit-taking banks and securities dealers jointly guarantee \nan amount of up to CHF\xc2\xa06 billion. Upon occurrence of a payout \n\n346\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\nevent triggered by a specified restriction of business imposed \nby FINMA or by the compulsory liquidation of another deposit-\ntaking bank, the Group\xe2\x80\x99s contribution will be calculated based \non its share of privileged deposits in proportion to total privileged \ndeposits. Based on  FINMA\xe2\x80\x99s estimate for the Group\xe2\x80\x99s banking \nsubsidiaries in Switzerland, the Group\xe2\x80\x99s share in the deposit insur-\nance guarantee program for the period July\xc2\xa01, 2018 to June\xc2\xa030, \n2019 is CHF\xc2\xa00.5 billion. These deposit insurance guarantees \nwere reflected in other guarantees.\n\nRepresentations and warranties on residential \nmortgage loans sold\n\nIn connection with the Global Markets division\xe2\x80\x99s sale of US resi-\ndential mortgage loans, the Group has provided certain represen-\ntations and warranties relating to the loans sold. The Group has \nprovided these representations and warranties relating to sales of \nloans to institutional investors, primarily banks, and non-agency, \nor private label, securitizations. The loans sold are primarily loans \nthat the Group has purchased from other parties. The scope of \nrepresentations and warranties, if any, depends on the transac-\ntion, but can include: ownership of the mortgage loans and legal \ncapacity to sell the loans; loan-to-value ratios and other char-\nacteristics of the property, the borrower and the loan; validity of \nthe liens securing the loans and absence of delinquent taxes or \nrelated liens; conformity to underwriting standards and com-\npleteness of documentation; and origination in compliance with \nlaw. If it is determined that representations and warranties were \nbreached, the Group may be required to repurchase the related \nloans or indemnify the investors to make them whole for losses. \nWhether the Group will incur a loss in connection with repur-\nchases and make whole payments depends on: the extent to \nwhich claims are made; the validity of such claims made within \nthe statute of limitations (including the likelihood and ability to \nenforce claims); whether the Group can successfully claim against \nparties that sold loans to the Group and made representations \nand warranties to the Group; the residential real estate market, \nincluding the number of defaults; and whether the obligations of \nthe securitization vehicles were guaranteed or insured by third \nparties.\n\nDuring 2018, the Group received repurchase claims for residen-\ntial mortgage loans that were not significant, and loans repur-\nchased during this period and related losses were not material. \nThe balance of outstanding repurchase claims as of the end of \n2018 was not significant.\n\nRepurchase claims on residential mortgage loans sold that are \nsubject to arbitration or litigation proceedings, or become so \nduring the reporting period, are not included in this Guarantees \nand commitments disclosure but are addressed in litigation and \nrelated loss contingencies and provisions. The Group is involved in \nlitigation relating to representations and warranties on residential \nmortgages sold. \n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cNote\xc2\xa039 \xe2\x80\x93 Litigation\xe2\x80\x9d for further information.\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nDisposal-related contingencies and other \nindemnifications\n\nThe Group has certain guarantees for which its maximum con-\ntingent liability cannot be quantified. These guarantees are not \nreflected in the \xe2\x80\x9cGuarantees\xe2\x80\x9d table and are discussed below.\n\nunrelated to the default of a clearing member. The Group has \ndetermined that it is not possible to reasonably estimate the maxi-\nmum potential amount of future payments due under the mem-\nbership arrangements. In addition, the Group believes that any \npotential requirement to make payments under these membership \narrangements is remote.\n\nDisposal-related contingencies\nIn connection with the sale of assets or businesses, the Group \nsometimes provides the acquirer with certain indemnification \nprovisions. These indemnification provisions vary by counter-\nparty in scope and duration and depend upon the type of assets \nor businesses sold. They are designed to transfer the potential \nrisk of certain unquantifiable and unknowable loss contingen-\ncies, such as litigation, tax and intellectual property matters, from \nthe acquirer to the seller. The Group closely monitors all such \ncontractual agreements in order to ensure that indemnification \nprovisions are adequately provided for in the Group\xe2\x80\x99s consolidated \nfinancial statements.\n\nLease commitments \n\n \n\nCHF million\xc2\xa0 \n2019\xc2\xa0 \n2020\xc2\xa0 \n2021\xc2\xa0 \n2022\xc2\xa0 \n2023\xc2\xa0 \nThereafter\xc2\xa0 \nFuture operating lease commitments\xc2\xa0 \nLess minimum non-cancellable sublease rentals\xc2\xa0 \nTotal net future minimum lease commitments\xc2\xa0 \n\n501 \n445 \n331 \n306 \n261 \n1,980 \n3,824 \n190 \n3,634 \n\nOther indemnifications\nThe Group provides indemnifications to certain counterparties \nin connection with its normal operating activities for which it is \nnot possible to estimate the maximum amount that it could be \nobligated to pay. As a normal part of issuing its own securities, \nthe Group typically agrees to reimburse holders for additional tax \nwithholding charges or assessments resulting from changes in \napplicable tax laws or the interpretation of those laws. Securi-\nties that include these agreements to pay additional amounts \ngenerally also include a related redemption or call provision if the \nobligation to pay the additional amounts results from a change in \nlaw or its interpretation and the obligation cannot be avoided by \nthe issuer taking reasonable steps to avoid the payment of addi-\ntional amounts. Since such potential obligations are dependent \non future changes in tax laws, the related liabilities the Group \nmay incur as a result of such changes cannot be reasonably esti-\nmated. In light of the related call provisions typically included, the \nGroup does not expect any potential liabilities in respect of tax \ngross-ups to be material.\n\nThe Group is a member of numerous securities exchanges and \nclearing houses and may, as a result of its membership arrange-\nments, be required to perform if another member defaults and \navailable amounts as defined in the relevant exchange\xe2\x80\x99s or clear-\ning house\xe2\x80\x99s default waterfalls are not sufficient to cover losses of \nanother member\xe2\x80\x99s default. The exchange\xe2\x80\x99s or clearing house\xe2\x80\x99s \ndefault management procedures may provide for cash calls to \nnon-defaulting members which may be limited to the amount (or a \nmultiple of the amount) of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s contribution to the guaran-\ntee fund. However, if these cash calls are not sufficient to cover \nlosses, the default waterfall and default management procedures \nmay foresee further loss allocation. Furthermore, some clearing \nhouse arrangements require members to assume a proportion-\nate share of non-default losses, if such losses exceed the speci-\nfied resources allocated for such purpose by the clearing house. \nNon-default losses result from the clearing house\xe2\x80\x99s investment of \nguarantee fund contributions and initial margin or are other losses \n\nRental expense for operating leases \nin\xc2\xa0 \n\n2018   \n\n2017   \n\n2016 \n\n \n\nCHF million\xc2\xa0 \nMinimum rental expense\xc2\xa0 \nSublease rental income\xc2\xa0 \nTotal net expenses for operating leases\xc2\xa0 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n516   \n(54)   \n462   \n\n575   \n(65)   \n510   \n\n550 \n(89) \n461 \n\nOperating lease commitments\n\nThe Group has contractual commitments under operating lease \narrangements for certain premises and equipment. Under oper-\nating leases, the leased property is not reported on the balance \nsheet of the lessee. Lease payments required by the contract are \ngenerally expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the \nlease. The related commitments for future rental expenses under \noperating leases are included in the table \xe2\x80\x9cLease commitments\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nFrom time to time, the Group may enter into sale-leaseback \ntransactions, in which an asset is sold and immediately leased \nback. If specific criteria are met, such asset is derecognized from \nthe balance sheet and an operating lease is recognized. If the \npresent value of the lease payments is equal to or higher than \n10% of the fair value of the property sold, any resulting gains up \nto an amount equal to the present value of the lease payments \nare deferred and recognized in the statement of operations over \nthe term of the lease as a reduction of rental expense. Gains on \nsale-leaseback transactions for which the lease payments are \nlower than 10% of the fair value of the property sold or gains in \nexcess of the present value of the lease payments are recognized \nin the statements of operations upon completion of the sale.\n\nSale-leaseback transactions \nDuring 2018, the Group entered into one sale-leaseback trans-\naction in respect of own property, which was recognized as an \noperating lease arrangement with a lease term of ten years. In \n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n347\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\n2017, we did not enter into any sale-leaseback transactions, and \nin 2016, the Group entered into several smaller sale-leaseback \ntransactions in respect of own property, which were all rec-\nognized as operating lease arrangements with lease terms of \n\nbetween one and five years. The total contractual rental expenses \nwere CHF\xc2\xa05 million for the 2018 sale-leaseback transaction and \nCHF\xc2\xa030 million for the 2016 sale-leaseback transactions.\n\nOther commitments \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \nend of\xc2\xa0 \n\n2018 (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \n \nIrrevocable commitments under documentary credits\xc2\xa0 \nIrrevocable loan commitments\xc2\xa02 \nForward reverse repurchase agreements\xc2\xa0 \nOther commitments\xc2\xa0 \nTotal other commitments\xc2\xa0 \n\n2017 (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \n \nIrrevocable commitments under documentary credits\xc2\xa0 \nIrrevocable loan commitments\xc2\xa02 \nForward reverse repurchase agreements\xc2\xa0 \nOther commitments\xc2\xa0 \nTotal other commitments\xc2\xa0 \n\nMaturity   \nless   \nthan   \n1 year   \n\nMaturity   \nbetween   \n1 to 3   \nyears   \n\nMaturity   \nbetween   \n3 to 5   \nyears   \n\nMaturity   \ngreater   \nthan   \n5 years   \n\n   \nTotal   \ngross   \namount   \n\n   \nTotal   \nnet   \namount   1 \n\n \n \nCollateral \nreceived \n\n5,056   \n26,882   \n31   \n329   \n32,298   \n\n4,976   \n24,296   \n12   \n219   \n29,503   \n\n182   \n34,188   \n0   \n11   \n34,381   \n\n113   \n33,649   \n0   \n13   \n33,775   \n\n0   \n45,938   \n0   \n119   \n46,057   \n\n1   \n40,425   \n0   \n11   \n40,437   \n\n0   \n9,065   \n0   \n33   \n9,098   \n\n1   \n8,031   \n0   \n104   \n8,136   \n\n5,238   \n116,073   \n31   \n492   \n121,834   \n\n5,077   \n111,967   \n31   \n492   \n117,567   \n\n5,091   \n106,401   \n12   \n347   \n111,851   \n\n5,000   \n101,270   \n12   \n347   \n106,629   \n\n     \n\n     \n\n \n \n \n \n3,651 \n57,153 \n31 \n4 \n60,839 \n\n \n \n \n \n3,218 \n42,307 \n12 \n0 \n45,537 \n\n1 Total net amount is computed as the gross amount less any participations.\n2 Irrevocable loan commitments do not include a total gross amount of CHF 113,580 million and CHF 108,663 million of unused credit limits as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respec-\n\ntively, which were revocable at the Group\xe2\x80\x99s sole discretion upon notice to the client.\n\nOther commitments\n\nIrrevocable commitments under documentary credits\nIrrevocable commitments under documentary credits include \nexposures from trade finance related to commercial letters of \ncredit under which the Group guarantees payments to exporters \nagainst presentation of shipping and other documents.\n\nIrrevocable loan commitments\nIrrevocable loan commitments are irrevocable credit facilities \nextended to clients and include fully or partially undrawn commit-\nments that are legally binding and cannot be unconditionally can-\ncelled by the Group. Commitments to originate mortgage loans \nthat will be held for sale are considered derivatives for accounting \npurposes and are not included in this disclosure. Such commit-\nments are reflected as derivatives in the consolidated balance \nsheets.\n\nForward reverse repurchase agreements\nForward reverse repurchase agreements represent transactions in \nwhich the initial cash exchange of the reverse repurchase trans-\nactions takes place on specified future dates. The Group enters \ninto forward reverse repurchase agreements with counterparties \nthat may have existing funded reverse repurchase agreements. \nDepending on the details of the counterparty contract with Credit \nSuisse, both a counterparty\xe2\x80\x99s existing funded reverse repurchase \nagreement and any forward reverse repurchase agreements \nunder contract with the same counterparty are considered.\n\nOther commitments\nOther commitments include private equity commitments, firm \ncommitments in underwriting securities, commitments arising \nfrom deferred payment letters of credit and from acceptances in \ncirculation and liabilities for call and put options on shares and \nother equity instruments.\n\n348\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\n34  Transfers of financial assets and variable interest entities\n\nIn the normal course of business, the Group enters into transac-\ntions with, and makes use of, SPEs. An SPE is an entity in the \nform of a trust or other legal structure designed to fulfill a specific \nlimited need of the company that organized it and is generally \nstructured to isolate the SPE\xe2\x80\x99s assets from creditors of other \nentities, including the Group. The principal uses of SPEs are to \nassist the Group and its clients in securitizing financial assets \nand creating investment products. The Group also uses SPEs for \nother client-driven activity, such as to facilitate financings, and for \nGroup tax or regulatory purposes.\n\nTransfers of financial assets\nSecuritizations\n\nThe majority of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s securitization activities involve mort-\ngages and mortgage-related securities and are predominantly \ntransacted using SPEs. In a typical securitization, the SPE pur-\nchases assets financed by proceeds received from the SPE\xe2\x80\x99s \nissuance of debt and equity instruments, certificates, CP and \nother notes of indebtedness. These assets and liabilities are \nrecorded on the balance sheet of the SPE and not reflected on \nthe Group\xe2\x80\x99s consolidated balance sheet, unless either the Group \nsold the assets to the entity and the accounting requirements for \nsale were not met or the Group consolidates the SPE.\n\nThe Group purchases commercial and residential mortgages for \nthe purpose of securitization and sells these mortgage loans to \nSPEs. These SPEs issue commercial mortgage-backed securi-\nties (CMBS), residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) \nand ABS that are collateralized by the assets transferred to the \nSPE and that pay a return based on the returns on those assets. \nInvestors in these mortgage-backed securities or ABS typically \nhave recourse to the assets in the SPEs. Third-party guaran-\ntees may further enhance the creditworthiness of the assets. The \ninvestors and the SPEs have no recourse to the Group\xe2\x80\x99s assets. \nThe Group is typically an underwriter of, and makes a market in, \nthese securities.\n\nThe Group also transacts in re-securitizations of previously issued \nRMBS securities. Typically, certificates issued out of an existing \nsecuritization vehicle are sold into a newly created and separate \nsecuritization vehicle. Often, these re-securitizations are initiated \nin order to re-securitize an existing security to give the investor an \ninvestment with different risk ratings or characteristics.\n\nThe Group also uses SPEs for other asset-backed financings \nrelating to client-driven activity and for Group tax or regulatory \npurposes. Types of structures included in this category include \nmanaged collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), CLOs, lever-\naged finance, repack and other types of transactions, includ-\ning life insurance structures, emerging market structures set up \nfor financing, loan participation or loan origination purposes, and \nother alternative structures created for the purpose of invest-\ning in venture capital-like investments. CLOs are collateralized by \nloans transferred to the CLO vehicle and pay a return based on \nthe returns on the loans. Leveraged finance structures are used \nto assist in the syndication of certain loans held by the Group, \nwhile repack structures are designed to give a client collateralized \nexposure to specific cash flows or credit risk backed by collat-\neral purchased from the Group. In these asset-backed financing \nstructures, investors typically only have recourse to the collateral \nof the SPE and do not have recourse to the Group\xe2\x80\x99s assets.\n\nWhen the Group transfers assets into an SPE, it must assess \nwhether that transfer is accounted for as a sale of the assets. \nTransfers of assets may not meet sale requirements if the assets \nhave not been legally isolated from the Group and/or if the \nGroup\xe2\x80\x99s continuing involvement is deemed to give it effective \ncontrol over the assets. If the transfer is not deemed a sale, it is \ninstead accounted for as a secured borrowing, with the trans-\nferred assets as collateral.\n\nGains and losses on securitization transactions depend, in part, \non the carrying values of mortgages and loans involved in the \ntransfer and are allocated between the assets sold and any ben-\neficial interests retained according to the relative fair values at the \ndate of sale.\n\nThe Group does not retain material servicing responsibilities from \nsecuritization activities.\n\nThe following table provides the gains or losses and proceeds \nfrom the transfer of assets relating to 2018, 2017 and 2016 \nsecuritizations of financial assets that qualify for sale account-\ning and subsequent derecognition, along with the cash flows \nbetween the Group and the SPEs used in any securitizations in \nwhich the Group still has continuing involvement, regardless of \nwhen the securitization occurred.\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n349\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nInvestors usually have recourse to the assets in the SPE and \noften benefit from other credit enhancements, such as collat-\neral accounts, or from liquidity facilities, such as lines of credit or \nliquidity put option of asset purchase agreements. The SPE may \nalso enter into a derivative contract in order to convert the yield or \ncurrency of the underlying assets to match the needs of the SPE \ninvestors, or to limit or change the credit risk of the SPE. The \nGroup may be the provider of certain credit enhancements as well \nas the counterparty to any related derivative contract.\n\nThe following table provides the outstanding principal balance \nof assets to which the Group continued to be exposed after the \ntransfer of the financial assets to any SPE and the total assets of \nthe SPE as of December\xc2\xa031, 2018 and 2017, regardless of when \nthe transfer of assets occurred.\n\nPrincipal amounts outstanding and total assets of SPEs \nresulting from continuing involvement\nend of\xc2\xa0 \n\n2018   \n\n2017 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nCHF million\xc2\xa0 \nCMBS\xc2\xa0 \nPrincipal amount outstanding\xc2\xa0 \nTotal assets of SPE\xc2\xa0 \nRMBS\xc2\xa0 \nPrincipal amount outstanding\xc2\xa0 \nTotal assets of SPE\xc2\xa0 \nOther asset-backed financings\xc2\xa0 \nPrincipal amount outstanding\xc2\xa0 \nTotal assets of SPE\xc2\xa0 \n\n   \n25,330   \n35,760   \n   \n40,253   \n41,242   \n   \n23,036   \n47,542   \n\n \n\n19,918 \n31,586 \n \n\n35,645 \n36,770 \n \n\n20,916 \n39,330 \n\nPrincipal amount outstanding relates to assets transferred from the Group and does not \ninclude principal amounts for assets transferred from third parties.\n\nFair value of beneficial interests\nThe fair value measurement of the beneficial interests held at the \ntime of transfer and as of the reporting date that result from any \ncontinuing involvement is determined using fair value estimation \ntechniques, such as the present value of estimated future cash \nflows that incorporate assumptions that market participants cus-\ntomarily use in these valuation techniques.

VIEs \nmay be sponsored by the Group or third parties. Such entities are \nrequired to be assessed for consolidation, compelling the primary \nbeneficiary to consolidate the VIE. The consolidation assess-\nment requires an entity to determine whether it has the power to \ndirect the activities that most significantly affect the economics \nof the VIE as well as whether the reporting entity has potentially \nsignificant benefits or losses in the VIE. The primary beneficiary \nassessment must be re-evaluated on an ongoing basis.\n\nApplication of the requirements for consolidation of VIEs may \nrequire the exercise of significant management judgment. In \nthe event consolidation of a VIE is required, the exposure to the \nGroup is limited to that portion of the VIE\xe2\x80\x99s assets attributable to \nany variable interest held by the Group prior to any risk manage-\nment activities to hedge the Group\xe2\x80\x99s net exposure. Any interests \nheld in the VIE by third parties, even though consolidated by the \nGroup, will not typically impact its results of operations.\n\nTransactions with VIEs are generally executed to facilitate secu-\nritization activities or to meet specific client needs, such as pro-\nviding liquidity or investing opportunities, and, as part of these \nactivities, the Group may hold interests in the VIEs. Securitiza-\ntion-related transactions with VIEs involve selling or purchas-\ning assets as well as possibly entering into related derivatives \nwith those VIEs, providing liquidity, credit or other support. Other \ntransactions with VIEs include derivative transactions in the \nGroup\xe2\x80\x99s capacity as the prime broker. The Group also enters into \nlending arrangements with VIEs for the purpose of financing proj-\nects or the acquisition of assets. Typically, the VIE\xe2\x80\x99s assets are \nrestricted in nature in that they are held primarily to satisfy the \nobligations of the entity. Further, the Group is involved with VIEs \nwhich were formed for the purpose of offering alternative invest-\nment solutions to clients. Such VIEs relate primarily to private \nequity investments, fund-linked vehicles or funds of funds, where \nthe Group acts as structurer, manager, distributor, broker, market \nmaker or liquidity provider.\n\nAs a consequence of these activities, the Group holds vari-\nable interests in VIEs. Such variable interests consist of financial \ninstruments issued by VIEs and which are held by the Group, \ncertain derivatives with VIEs or loans to VIEs. Guarantees issued \nby the Group to or on behalf of VIEs may also qualify as variable \ninterests. For such guarantees, including derivatives that act as \nguarantees, the notional amount of the respective guarantees is \npresented to represent the exposure. In general, investors in con-\nsolidated VIEs do not have recourse to the Group in the event of \na default, except where a guarantee was provided to the investors \n\n354\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\nor where the Group is the counterparty to a derivative transaction \ninvolving VIEs.\n\nTotal assets of consolidated and non-consolidated VIEs for which \nthe Group has involvement represent the total assets of the VIEs \neven though the Group\xe2\x80\x99s involvement may be significantly less \ndue to interests held by third-party investors. The asset bal-\nances for non-consolidated VIEs where the Group has significant \ninvolvement represent the most current information available to \nthe Group regarding the remaining principal balance of assets \nowned. In most cases, the asset balances represent an amortized \ncost basis without regards to impairments in fair value, unless fair \nvalue information is readily available.\n\nThe Group\xe2\x80\x99s maximum exposure to loss is different from the car-\nrying value of the assets of the VIE. This maximum exposure to \nloss consists of the carrying value of the Group variable interests \nheld as trading assets, derivatives and loans, the notional amount \nof guarantees and off-balance sheet commitments to VIEs, rather \nthan the amount of total assets of the VIEs. The maximum expo-\nsure to loss does not reflect the Group\xe2\x80\x99s risk management activi-\nties, including effects from financial instruments that the Group \nmay utilize to economically hedge the risks inherent in these VIEs. \nThe economic risks associated with VIE exposures held by the \nGroup, together with all relevant risk mitigation initiatives, are \nincluded in the Group\xe2\x80\x99s risk management framework.\n\nThe Group has not provided financial or other support to con-\nsolidated or non-consolidated VIEs that it was not contractually \nrequired to provide.\n\nCollateralized debt and loan obligations\n\nThe Group engages in CDO/CLO transactions to meet client and \ninvestor needs, earn fees and sell financial assets and, for CLOs, \nloans. The Group may act as underwriter, placement agent or \nasset manager and may warehouse assets prior to the closing \nof a transaction. As part of its structured finance business, the \nGroup purchases loans and other debt obligations from and on \nbehalf of clients for the purpose of securitization. The loans and \nother debt obligations are sold to VIEs, which in turn issue CDO/\nCLOs to fund the purchase of assets such as investment grade \nand high yield corporate debt instruments.\n\nTypically, the collateral manager in a managed CDO/CLO is \ndeemed to be the entity that has the power to direct the activi-\nties that most affect the economics of the entity. In a static CDO/\nCLO this \xe2\x80\x9cpower\xe2\x80\x9d role is more difficult to analyze and may be the \nsponsor of the entity or the CDS counterparty.\n\nCDO/CLOs provide credit risk exposure to a portfolio of ABS or \nloans (cash CDO/CLOs) or a reference portfolio of securities or \nloans (synthetic CDO/CLOs). Cash CDO/CLO transactions hold \nactual securities or loans whereas synthetic CDO/CLO transac-\ntions use CDS to exchange the underlying credit risk instead of \nusing cash assets. The Group may also act as a derivative coun-\nterparty to the VIEs, which are typically not variable interests, and \n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nmay invest in portions of the notes or equity issued by the VIEs. \nThe CDO/CLO entities may have actively managed portfolios or \nstatic portfolios.\n\na purchase. In entering into such agreements, the Group reviews \nthe credit risk associated with these transactions on the same \nbasis that would apply to other extensions of credit.\n\nThe securities issued by these VIEs are payable solely from the \ncash flows of the related collateral, and third-party creditors of \nthese VIEs do not have recourse to the Group in the event of \ndefault.\n\nThe Group\xe2\x80\x99s exposure in CDO/CLO transactions is typically lim-\nited to interests retained in connection with its underwriting or \nmarket-making activities. Unless the Group has been deemed to \nhave \xe2\x80\x9cpower\xe2\x80\x9d over the entity and these interests are potentially \nsignificant, the Group is not the primary beneficiary of the vehicle \nand does not consolidate the entity. The Group\xe2\x80\x99s maximum expo-\nsure to loss does not include any effects from financial instru-\nments used to economically hedge the risks of the VIEs.\n\nCommercial paper conduit\n\nThe Group acts as the administrator and provider of liquidity \nand credit enhancement facilities for Alpine Securitization Ltd \n(Alpine), a multi-seller asset-backed CP conduit used for client \nand Group financing purposes. Alpine discloses to CP investors \ncertain portfolio and asset data and submits its portfolio to rat-\ning agencies for public ratings. This CP conduit purchases assets \nsuch as loans and receivables or enters into reverse repurchase \nagreements and finances such activities through the issuance of \nCP backed by these assets. The CP conduit can enter into liquid-\nity facilities with third-party entities pursuant to which it may be \nrequired to purchase assets from these entities to provide them \nwith liquidity and credit support. The financing transactions are \nstructured to provide credit support to the CP conduit in the form \nof over-collateralization and other asset-specific enhancements. \nAlpine is a separate legal entity that is wholly owned by the \nGroup. However, its assets are available to satisfy only the claims \nof its creditors. In addition, the Group, as administrator and liquid-\nity facility provider, has significant exposure to and power over \nthe activities of Alpine. Alpine is considered a VIE for accounting \npurposes and the Group is deemed the primary beneficiary and \nconsolidates this entity.\n\nThe overall average maturity of Alpine\xe2\x80\x99s outstanding CP was \napproximately 129 days as of December\xc2\xa031, 2018. Alpine was \nrated A-1(sf) by Standard & Poor\xe2\x80\x99s and P-1(sf) by Moody\xe2\x80\x99s and \nhad exposures mainly in a reverse repurchase agreement with a \nGroup entity, consumer loans and car loans.\n\nThe Group\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to this CP conduit consists of obliga-\ntions under liquidity agreements. The liquidity agreements are \nasset-specific arrangements, which require the Group to provide \nshort-term financing to the CP conduit or to purchase assets \nfrom the CP conduit in certain circumstances, including a lack of \nliquidity in the CP market such that the CP conduit cannot refi-\nnance its obligations or, in some cases, a default of an underlying \nasset. The asset-specific credit enhancements provided by the \nclient seller of the assets remain unchanged as a result of such \n\nThe Group\xe2\x80\x99s economic risks associated with the CP conduit are \nincluded in the Group\xe2\x80\x99s risk management framework including \ncounterparty, economic risk capital and scenario analysis.\n\nFinancial intermediation\n\nThe Group has significant involvement with VIEs in its role as a \nfinancial intermediary on behalf of clients.\n\nThe Group considers the likelihood of incurring a loss equal to \nthe maximum exposure to be remote because of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s risk \nmitigation efforts, including, but not limited to, economic hedging \nstrategies and collateral arrangements. The Group\xe2\x80\x99s economic \nrisks associated with consolidated and non-consolidated VIE \nexposures arising from financial intermediation, together with all \nrelevant risk mitigation initiatives, are included in the Group\xe2\x80\x99s risk \nmanagement framework.\n\nFinancial intermediation consists of securitizations, funds, loans, \nand other vehicles. \n\nSecuritizations\nSecuritizations are primarily CMBS, RMBS and ABS vehicles. \nThe Group acts as an underwriter, market maker, liquidity pro-\nvider, derivative counterparty and/or provider of credit enhance-\nments to VIEs related to certain securitization transactions. \n\nThe maximum exposure to loss is the carrying value of the loan \nsecurities and derivative positions that are variable interests, if \nany, plus the exposure arising from any credit enhancements the \nGroup provided. The Group\xe2\x80\x99s maximum exposure to loss does not \ninclude any effects from financial instruments used to economi-\ncally hedge the risks of the VIEs.\n\nThe activities that have the most significant impact on the securi-\ntization vehicle are the decisions relating to defaulted loans, which \nare controlled by the servicer. The party that controls the servic-\ning has the ability to make decisions that significantly affect the \nresult of the activities of the securitization vehicle. If a securitiza-\ntion vehicle has multiple parties that control servicing over specific \nassets, the Group determines it has power when it has control \nover the servicing of greater than 50% of the assets in the secu-\nritization vehicle. When a servicer or its related party also has an \neconomic interest that has the potential to absorb a significant \nportion of the gains and/or losses, it will be deemed the primary \nbeneficiary and consolidate the vehicle. If the Group determines \nthat it controls the relevant servicing, it then determines if it \nhas the obligation to absorb losses from, or the right to receive \nbenefits of, the securitization vehicle that could potentially be \nsignificant to the vehicle, primarily by evaluating the amount and \nnature of securities issued by the vehicle that it holds. Factors \nconsidered in this analysis include the level of subordination of the \nsecurities held as well as the size of the position, based on the \n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n355\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\npercentage of the class of securities and the total deal classes \nof securities issued. The more subordinated the level of securi-\nties held, the more likely it is that the Group will be the primary \nbeneficiary. This consolidation analysis is performed each report-\ning period based on changes in inventory and the levels of assets \nremaining in the securitization. The Group typically consolidates \nsecuritization vehicles when it is the servicer and has holdings \nstemming from its role as underwriter. Short-term market making \nholdings in vehicles are not typically considered to be potentially \nsignificant for the purposes of this assessment.\n\nIn the case of re-securitizations of previously issued RMBS secu-\nrities, the re-securitization vehicles are passive in nature and do \nnot have any significant ongoing activities that require manage-\nment, and decisions relating to the design of the securitization \ntransaction at its inception are the key power relating to the vehi-\ncle. Activities at inception include selecting the assets and deter-\nmining the capital structure. The power over a re-securitization \nvehicle is typically shared between the Group and the investor(s) \ninvolved in the design and creation of the vehicle. The Group \nconcludes that it is the primary beneficiary of a re-securitization \nvehicle when it owns substantially all of the bonds issued from the \nvehicle.\n\nFunds\nFunds include investment structures such as mutual funds, funds \nof funds, private equity funds and fund-linked products where \nthe investors\xe2\x80\x99 interest is typically in the form of debt rather than \nequity, thereby making them VIEs. The Group may have various \nrelationships with such VIEs in the form of structurer, investment \nadvisor, investment manager, administrator, custodian, under-\nwriter, placement agent, market maker and/or as prime broker. \nThese activities include the use of VIEs in structuring fund-linked \nproducts, hedge funds of funds or private equity investments to \nprovide clients with investment opportunities in alternative invest-\nments. In such transactions, a VIE holds underlying investments \nand issues securities that provide the investors with a return \nbased on the performance of those investments.\n\nThe maximum exposure to loss consists of the fair value of instru-\nments issued by such structures that are held by the Group as \na result of underwriting or market-making activities, financing \nprovided to the vehicles and the Group\xe2\x80\x99s exposure resulting from \nprincipal protection and redemptions features. The investors typi-\ncally retain the risk of loss on such transactions, but for certain \nfund types, the Group may provide principal protection on the \nsecurities to limit the investors\xe2\x80\x99 exposure to downside market risk. \nThe Group\xe2\x80\x99s maximum exposure to loss does not include any \neffects from financial instruments used to economically hedge the \nrisk of the VIEs.\n\nAnother model is used to assess funds for consolidation under \nUS GAAP. Rather than the consolidation model which incor-\nporates power and the potential to absorb significant risk and \nrewards, a previous consolidation model is used which results in \nthe Group being the primary beneficiary and consolidating the \nfunds if it holds more than 50% of their outstanding issuances.\n\nLoans\nThe Group provides loans to financing vehicles owned or spon-\nsored by clients or third-parties. These tailored lending arrange-\nments are established to purchase, lease or otherwise finance \nand manage clients\xe2\x80\x99 assets and include financing of specified cli-\nent assets, of an individual single-asset used by the client or busi-\nness ventures. The respective owner of the assets or manager of \nthe businesses provides the equity in the vehicle.\n\nThe maximum exposure to loss is the carrying value of the \nGroup\xe2\x80\x99s loan exposure, which is subject to the same credit risk \nmanagement procedures as loans issued directly to clients. The \nclients\xe2\x80\x99 creditworthiness is carefully reviewed, loan-to-value ratios \nare strictly set and, in addition, clients provide equity, additional \ncollateral or guarantees, all of which significantly reduce the \nGroup\xe2\x80\x99s exposure. The Group considers the likelihood of incurring \na loss equal to the maximum exposure to be remote because of \nthe Group\xe2\x80\x99s risk mitigation efforts, which includes over-collateral-\nization and effective monitoring to ensure that a sufficient loan-to-\nvalue ratio is maintained.\n\nThe third-party sponsor of the VIE will typically have control over \nthe assets during the life of the structure and have the potential \nto absorb significant gains and losses; the Group is typically not \nthe primary beneficiary of these structures and will not have to \nconsolidate them. However, a change in the structure, such as \na default of the sponsor, may result in the Group gaining control \nover the assets. If the Group\xe2\x80\x99s lending is significant, it may then \nbe required to consolidate the entity.\n\nOther\nOther includes additional vehicles where the Group provides \nfinancing and trust preferred issuance vehicles. Trust preferred \nissuance vehicles are utilized to assist the Group in raising cap-\nital-efficient financing. The VIE issues preference shares which \nare guaranteed by the Group and uses the proceeds to purchase \nthe debt of the Group. The Group\xe2\x80\x99s guarantee of its own debt \nis not considered a variable interest and, as it has no holdings \nin these vehicles, the Group has no maximum exposure to loss. \nNon-consolidated VIEs include only the total assets of trust pre-\nferred issuance vehicles, as the Group has no variable interests \nwith these entities.\n\n356\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nConsolidated VIEs\n\nThe Group has significant involvement with VIEs in its role as a \nfinancial intermediary on behalf of clients.

Credit limits relating to counterpar-\nties and products are managed through counterparty limits which \nset the maximum credit exposures the Group is willing to assume \nto specific counterparties over specified periods. Country limits \nare established to avoid any undue country risk concentration.\n\nFrom an industry point of view, the combined credit exposure of \nthe Group is diversified. A large portion of the credit exposure is \nwith individual clients, particularly through residential mortgages \nin Switzerland, or relates to transactions with financial institutions. \nIn both cases, the customer base is extensive and the num-\nber and variety of transactions are broad. For transactions with \nfinancial institutions, the business is also geographically diverse, \nwith operations focused in the Americas, Europe and, to a lesser \nextent, Asia Pacific.\n\nFair value measurement\n\nA significant portion of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s financial instruments is carried \nat fair value. Deterioration of financial markets could significantly \nimpact the fair value of these financial instruments and the results \nof operations.\n\nThe fair value of the majority of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s financial instruments \nis based on quoted prices in active markets or observable inputs. \nThese instruments include government and agency securities, \ncertain CP, most investment grade corporate debt, certain high \nyield debt securities, exchange-traded and certain OTC deriva-\ntives and most listed equity securities.\n\nIn addition, the Group holds financial instruments for which no \nprices are available and which have few or no observable inputs. \nFor these instruments, the determination of fair value requires \nsubjective assessment and judgment, depending on liquidity, \npricing assumptions, the current economic and competitive envi-\nronment and the risks affecting the specific instrument. In such \ncircumstances, valuation is determined based on management\xe2\x80\x99s \nown judgments about the assumptions that market participants \nwould use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions \nabout risk. These instruments include certain OTC derivatives, \nincluding interest rate, foreign exchange, equity and credit deriva-\ntives, certain corporate equity-linked securities, mortgage-related \nand CDO securities, private equity investments and certain loans \nand credit products, including leveraged finance, certain syndi-\ncated loans and certain high yield bonds, and life finance instru-\nments. The fair value measurement disclosures exclude derivative \ntransactions that are daily settled.\n\nThe fair value of financial instruments is impacted by factors \nsuch as benchmark interest rates, prices of financial instruments \nissued by third parties, commodity prices, foreign exchange rates \nand index prices or rates. In addition, valuation adjustments are \nan integral part of the valuation process when market prices \nare not indicative of the credit quality of a counterparty, and are \napplied to both OTC derivatives and debt instruments. The impact \nof changes in a counterparty\xe2\x80\x99s credit spreads (known as credit \nvaluation adjustments) is considered when measuring the fair \nvalue of assets, and the impact of changes in the Group\xe2\x80\x99s own \ncredit spreads (known as debit valuation adjustments) is con-\nsidered when measuring the fair value of its liabilities. For OTC \nderivatives, the impact of changes in both the Group\xe2\x80\x99s and the \ncounterparty\xe2\x80\x99s credit standing is considered when measuring \ntheir fair value, based on current CDS prices. The adjustments \nalso take into account contractual factors designed to reduce \nthe Group\xe2\x80\x99s credit exposure to a counterparty, such as collateral \nheld and master netting agreements. For hybrid debt instruments \nwith embedded derivative features, the impact of changes in the \nGroup\xe2\x80\x99s credit standing is considered when measuring their fair \nvalue, based on current funded debt spreads.\n\nUS GAAP permits a reporting entity to measure the fair value of \na group of financial assets and financial liabilities on the basis of \nthe price that would be received to sell a net long position or paid \nto transfer a net short position for a particular risk exposure in an \norderly transaction between market participants at the measure-\nment date. As such, the Group continues to apply bid and offer \nadjustments to net portfolios of cash securities and/or derivative \ninstruments to adjust the value of the net position from a mid-\nmarket price to the appropriate bid or offer level that would be \nrealized under normal market conditions for the net long or net \nshort position for a specific market risk. In addition, the Group \nreflects the net exposure to credit risk for its derivative instru-\nments where the Group has legally enforceable agreements with \nits counterparties that mitigate credit risk exposure in the event of \ndefault.\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n359\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nValuation adjustments are recorded in a reasonable and consis-\ntent manner that results in an allocation to the relevant disclosures \nin the notes to the financial statements as if the valuation adjust-\nment had been allocated to the individual unit of account.\n\nFair value hierarchy\n\nThe levels of the fair value hierarchy are defined as follows:\np  Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for \n\nidentical assets or liabilities that the Group has the ability to \naccess. This level of the fair value hierarchy provides the most \nreliable evidence of fair value and is used to measure fair value \nwhenever available.\n\np  Level 2: Inputs other than quoted prices included within level\xc2\xa01 \n\nthat are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or \nindirectly. These inputs include: (i) quoted prices for similar \nassets or liabilities in active markets; (ii) quoted prices for iden-\ntical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, \nthat is, markets in which there are few transactions for the \nasset or liability, the prices are not current or price quotations \nvary substantially either over time or among market makers, or \nin which little information is publicly available; (iii) inputs other \nthan quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability; \nor (iv) inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated \nby observable market data by correlation or other means.\n\np  Level 3: Inputs that are unobservable for the asset or liabil-\n\nity. These inputs reflect the Group\xe2\x80\x99s own assumptions about \nthe assumptions that market participants would use in pricing \nthe asset or liability (including assumptions about risk). These \ninputs are developed based on the best information available \nin the circumstances, which include the Group\xe2\x80\x99s own data. \nThe Group\xe2\x80\x99s own data used to develop unobservable inputs is \nadjusted if information indicates that market participants would \nuse different assumptions.\n\nThe Group records net open positions at bid prices if long, or at \nask prices if short, unless the Group is a market maker in such \npositions, in which case mid-pricing is utilized. Fair value mea-\nsurements are not adjusted for transaction costs.\n\nQualitative disclosures of valuation techniques\n\nThe following information on the valuation techniques and signifi-\ncant unobservable inputs of the various financial instruments and \nthe section \xe2\x80\x9cUncertainty of fair value measurements at the report-\ning date from the use of significant unobservable inputs\xe2\x80\x9d should \nbe read in conjunction with the tables \xe2\x80\x9cAssets and liabilities mea-\nsured at fair value on a recurring basis\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cQuantitative information \nabout level\xc2\xa03 assets at fair value\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cQuantitative information \nabout level\xc2\xa03 liabilities at fair value\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nCentral bank funds sold, securities purchased under \nresale agreements and securities borrowing transactions\nSecurities purchased under resale agreements and securities sold \nunder repurchase agreements are measured at fair value using \ndiscounted cash flow analysis. Future cash flows are discounted \n\n360\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\nusing observable market interest rate repurchase/resale curves \nfor the applicable maturity and underlying collateral of the instru-\nments. As such, the significant majority of both securities pur-\nchased under resale agreements and securities sold under \nrepurchase agreements are included in level\xc2\xa02 of the fair value \nhierarchy. Structured resale and repurchase agreements include \nembedded derivatives, which are measured using the same tech-\nniques as described below for stand-alone derivative contracts \nheld for trading purposes or used in hedge accounting relation-\nships. If the value of the embedded derivative is determined using \nsignificant unobservable inputs, those structured resale and \nrepurchase agreements included are classified as level\xc2\xa03 in the \nfair value hierarchy. The significant unobservable input is funding \nspread.\n\nSecurities purchased under resale agreements are usually fully \ncollateralized or over-collateralized by government securities, \nmoney market instruments, corporate bonds, or other debt instru-\nments. In the event of counterparty default, the collateral service \nagreement provides the Group with the right to liquidate the col-\nlateral held.\n\nDebt securities\nForeign governments\nForeign government debt securities typically have quoted prices in \nactive markets and are mainly categorized as level\xc2\xa01 instruments. \nValuations of foreign government debt securities for which mar-\nket prices are not available are based on yields reflecting credit \nrating, historical performance, delinquencies, loss severity, the \nmaturity of the security, recent transactions in the market or other \nmodeling techniques, which may involve judgment. Those securi-\nties where the price or model inputs are observable in the market \nare categorized as level\xc2\xa02 instruments, while those securities \nwhere prices are not observable and significant model inputs are \nunobservable are categorized as level\xc2\xa03 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nCorporates\nCorporate bonds are priced to reflect current market levels either \nthrough recent market transactions or broker or dealer quotes. \nWhere a market price for the particular security is not directly \navailable, valuations are obtained based on yields reflected by \nother instruments in the specific or similar entity\xe2\x80\x99s capital struc-\nture and adjusting for differences in seniority and maturity, bench-\nmarking to a comparable security where market data is available \n(taking into consideration differences in credit, liquidity and matu-\nrity), or through the application of cash flow modeling techniques \nutilizing observable inputs, such as current interest rate curves \nand observable CDS spreads. Significant unobservable inputs \nmay include correlation and price. For securities using market \ncomparable price, the differentiation between level\xc2\xa02 and level\xc2\xa03 \nis based upon the relative significance of any yield adjustments as \nwell as the accuracy of the comparison characteristics (i.e., the \nobservable comparable security may be in the same country but \na different industry and may have a different seniority level \xe2\x80\x93 the \nlower the comparability the more likely the security will be level\xc2\xa03).\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nRMBS, CMBS and CDO securities\nFair values of RMBS, CMBS and CDO may be available through \nquoted prices, which are often based on the prices at which \nsimilarly structured and collateralized securities trade between \ndealers and to and from customers. Fair values of RMBS, CMBS \nand CDO for which there are significant unobservable inputs are \nvalued using capitalization rate and discount rate. Price may not \nbe observable for fair value measurement purposes for many \nreasons, such as the length of time since the last executed \ntransaction for the related security, use of a price from a similar \ninstrument, or use of a price from an indicative quote. Fair values \ndetermined by market comparable price may include discounted \ncash flow models using the inputs credit spread, default rate, dis-\ncount rate, prepayment rate and loss severity. Prices from similar \nobservable instruments are used to calculate implied inputs which \nare then used to value unobservable instruments using discounted \ncash flow. The discounted cash flow price is then compared to \nthe unobservable prices and assessed for reasonableness.\n\nFor most structured debt securities, determination of fair value \nrequires subjective assessment depending on liquidity, owner-\nship concentration, and the current economic and competitive \nenvironment. Valuation is determined based on the Front Office\xe2\x80\x99s \nown assumptions about how market participants would price the \nasset. Collateralized bond and loan obligations are split into vari-\nous structured tranches and each tranche is valued based upon \nits individual rating and the underlying collateral supporting the \nstructure. Valuation models are used to value both cash and syn-\nthetic CDOs.\n\nEquity securities\nThe majority of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s positions in equity securities are \ntraded on public stock exchanges for which quoted prices are \nreadily and regularly available and are therefore categorized as \nlevel\xc2\xa01 instruments. Level\xc2\xa02 and level\xc2\xa03 equities include fund-\nlinked products, convertible bonds or equity securities with \nrestrictions that are not traded in active markets. Significant \nunobservable inputs may include earnings before interest, taxes, \ndepreciation and amortization (EBITDA) multiple and market com-\nparable price.\n\nDerivatives\nDerivatives held for trading purposes or used in hedge account-\ning relationships include both OTC and exchange-traded deriva-\ntives. The fair values of exchange-traded derivatives measured \nusing observable exchange prices are included in level\xc2\xa01 of the \nfair value hierarchy. For exchange-traded derivatives where the \nvolume of trading is low, the observable exchange prices may not \nbe considered executable at the reporting date. These derivatives \nare valued in the same manner as similar observable OTC deriva-\ntives and are included in level\xc2\xa02 of the fair value hierarchy. If the \nsimilar OTC derivative used for valuing the exchange-traded deriv-\native is not observable, the exchange-traded derivative is included \nin level\xc2\xa03 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nThe fair values of OTC derivatives are determined on the basis of \neither industry standard models or internally developed proprietary \nmodels. Both model types use various observable and unobserv-\nable inputs in order to determine fair value. The inputs include \nthose characteristics of the derivative that have a bearing on the \neconomics of the instrument. The determination of the fair value \nof many derivatives involves only a limited degree of subjectivity \nbecause the required inputs are observable in the marketplace, \nwhile more complex derivatives may use unobservable inputs that \nrely on specific proprietary modeling assumptions. Where observ-\nable inputs (prices from exchanges, dealers, brokers or market \nconsensus data providers) are not available, attempts are made \nto infer values from observable prices through model calibration \n(spot and forward rates, mean reversion, benchmark interest rate \ncurves and volatility inputs for commonly traded option products). \nFor inputs that cannot be derived from other sources, estimates \nfrom historical data may be made. OTC derivatives where the \nmajority of the value is derived from market observable inputs are \ncategorized as level\xc2\xa02 instruments, while those where the majority \nof the value is derived from unobservable inputs are categorized \nas level\xc2\xa03 of the fair value hierarchy.\n\nThe valuation of derivatives includes an adjustment for the cost of \nfunding uncollateralized OTC derivatives.\n\nInterest rate derivatives\nOTC vanilla interest rate products, such as interest rate swaps, \nswaptions and caps and floors are valued by discounting the \nanticipated future cash flows. The future cash flows and discount-\ning are derived from market standard yield curves and industry \nstandard volatility inputs. Where applicable, exchange-traded \nprices are also used to value exchange-traded futures and options \nand can be used in yield curve construction. For more complex \nproducts, inputs include, but are not limited to basis spread, cor-\nrelation, credit spread, prepayment rate and volatility skew.\n\nForeign exchange derivatives\nForeign exchange derivatives include vanilla products such as \nspot, forward and option contracts where the anticipated dis-\ncounted future cash flows are determined from foreign exchange \nforward curves and industry standard optionality modeling tech-\nniques. Where applicable, exchange-traded prices are also used \nfor futures and option prices. For more complex products inputs \ninclude, but are not limited to, contingent probability, correlation \nand prepayment rate.\n\nEquity and index-related derivatives\nEquity derivatives include a variety of products ranging from \nvanilla options and swaps to exotic structures with bespoke pay-\noff profiles. The main inputs in the valuation of equity derivatives \nmay include buyback probability, correlation, gap risk, price and \nvolatility.\n\nGenerally, the interrelationship between the correlation and volatil-\nity is positively correlated.\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n361\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nCredit derivatives\nCredit derivatives include index, single-name and multi-name \nCDS in addition to more complex structured credit products. \nVanilla products are valued using industry standard models and \ninputs that are generally market observable including credit \nspread and recovery rate.\n\nComplex structured credit derivatives are valued using propri-\netary models requiring inputs such as correlation, credit spread, \nfunding spread, loss severity, prepayment rate and recovery rate. \nThese inputs are generally implied from available market observ-\nable data.\n\nOther trading assets\nOther trading assets primarily include life settlement and premium \nfinance instruments and RMBS loans. Life settlement and pre-\nmium finance instruments are valued using proprietary models \nwith several inputs. The significant unobservable inputs of the fair \nvalue for life settlement and premium finance instruments is the \nestimate of market implied life expectancy, while for RMBS loans \nit is market comparable price.\n\nFor life settlement and premium finance instruments, individual \nlife expectancy rates are typically obtained by multiplying a base \nmortality curve for the general insured population provided by a \nprofessional actuarial organization together with an individual-spe-\ncific multiplier. Individual-specific multipliers are determined based \non data from third-party life expectancy data providers, which \nexamine the insured individual\xe2\x80\x99s medical conditions, family history \nand other factors to arrive at a life expectancy estimate.\n\nFor RMBS loans, the use of market comparable price varies \ndepending upon each specific loan. For some loans, similar to \nunobservable RMBS securities, prices from similar observable \ninstruments are used to calculate implied inputs which are then \nused to value unobservable instruments using discounted cash \nflow. The discounted cash flow price is then compared to the \nunobservable prices and assessed for reasonableness. For other \nRMBS loans, the loans are categorized by specific characteris-\ntics, such as loan-to-value ratio, average account balance, loan \ntype (single or multi-family), lien, seasoning, coupon, FICO score, \nlocality, delinquency status, cash flow velocity, roll rates, loan pur-\npose, occupancy, servicers advance agreement type, modification \nstatus, Federal Housing Administration insurance, property value \nand documentation quality. Loans with unobservable prices are \nput into consistent buckets which are then compared to market \nobservable comparable prices in order to assess the reasonable-\nness of those unobservable prices.\n\nOther investments\nPrivate equity funds, hedge funds and equity method \ninvestment funds\nEquity method investment funds principally include equity invest-\nments in the form of a) direct investments in third-party hedge \n\nfunds, private equity funds and funds of funds, b) equity method \ninvestments where the Group has the ability to significantly influ-\nence the operating and financial policies of the investee, and c) \ndirect investments in non-marketable equity securities.\n\nDirect investments in third-party hedge funds, private equity \nfunds and funds of funds are measured at fair value based on \ntheir published NAVs as permitted by ASC Topic 820 \xe2\x80\x93 Fair Value \nMeasurement. In some cases, NAVs may be adjusted where \nthere is sufficient evidence that the NAV published by the invest-\nment manager is not in line with the fund\xe2\x80\x99s observable market \ndata, it is probable that the investment will be sold for an amount \nother than NAV or other circumstances exist that would require \nan adjustment to the published NAV. Although rarely adjusted, \nsignificant judgment is involved in making any adjustments to \nthe published NAVs. The investments for which the fair value is \nmeasured using the NAV practical expedient are not categorized \nwithin the fair value hierarchy.\n\nDirect investments in non-marketable equity securities consist \nof both real estate investments and non-real estate investments. \nEquity-method investments and direct investments in non-mar-\nketable equity securities are initially measured at their transaction \nprice, as this is the best estimate of fair value. Thereafter, these \ninvestments are individually measured at fair value based upon \na number of factors that include any recent rounds of financing \ninvolving third-party investors, comparable company transactions, \nmultiple analyses of cash flows or book values, or discounted \ncash flow analyses. The availability of information used in these \nmodeling techniques is often limited and involves significant \njudgment in evaluating these different factors over time. As a \nresult, these investments are included in level\xc2\xa03 of the fair value \nhierarchy.\n\nLife finance instruments\nLife finance instruments include single premium immediate annui-\nties (SPIA) and other premium finance instruments. Life finance \ninstruments are valued in a similar manner as described for life \nsettlement and premium finance instruments under the other \ntrading assets section above.\n\nLoans\nThe Group\xe2\x80\x99s loan portfolio which is measured at fair value pri-\nmarily consists of commercial and industrial loans and loans to \nfinancial institutions. Within these categories, loans measured at \nfair value include commercial loans, real estate loans, corporate \nloans, leverage finance loans and emerging market loans. Fair \nvalue is based on recent transactions and quoted prices, where \navailable. Where recent transactions and quoted prices are not \navailable, fair value may be determined by relative value bench-\nmarking (which includes pricing based upon another position in \nthe same capital structure, other comparable loan issues, generic \nindustry credit spreads, implied credit spreads derived from CDS \nfor the specific borrower, and enterprise valuations) or calculated \n\n362\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nbased on the exit price of the collateral, based on current market \nconditions.\n\nBoth the funded and unfunded portion of revolving credit lines \non the corporate lending portfolio are valued using a loan pric-\ning model, which requires estimates of significant inputs includ-\ning credit conversion factors, credit spreads, recovery rates and \nweighted average life of the loan. Significant unobservable inputs \nmay include credit spread and price.\n\nThe Group\xe2\x80\x99s other assets and liabilities include mortgage loans \nheld in conjunction with securitization activities and assets and \nliabilities of VIEs and mortgage securitizations that do not meet \nthe criteria for sale treatment under US GAAP. The fair value of \nmortgage loans held in conjunction with securitization activities is \ndetermined on a whole-loan basis and is consistent with the valu-\nation of RMBS loans discussed in \xe2\x80\x9cOther trading assets\xe2\x80\x9d above. \nWhole-loan valuations are calculated based on the exit price \nreflecting the current market conditions. The fair value of assets \nand liabilities of VIEs and mortgage securitizations that do not \nmeet the criteria for sale treatment under US GAAP are deter-\nmined based on the quoted prices for securitized bonds, where \navailable, or on cash flow analyses for securitized bonds, when \nquoted prices are not available. The fair value of the consolidated \nfinancial assets of RMBS and CMBS securitization vehicles, \nwhich qualify as collateralized financing entities, are measured on \nthe basis of the more observable fair value of the VIEs\xe2\x80\x99 financial \nliabilities.\n\nShort-term borrowings and long-term debt\nThe Group\xe2\x80\x99s short-term borrowings and long-term debt include \nstructured notes (hybrid financial instruments that are both bifur-\ncatable and non-bifurcatable) and vanilla debt. The fair value \nof structured notes is based on quoted prices, where available. \nWhen quoted prices are not available, fair value is determined by \nusing a discounted cash flow model incorporating the Group\xe2\x80\x99s \ncredit spreads, the value of derivatives embedded in the debt and \nthe residual term of the issuance based on call options. Deriva-\ntives structured into the issued debt are valued consistently with \nthe Group\xe2\x80\x99s stand-alone derivative contracts held for trading pur-\nposes or used in hedge accounting relationships as discussed \nabove. The fair value of structured debt is heavily influenced by \nthe combined call options and performance of the underlying \nderivative returns. Significant unobservable inputs for short-term \nborrowings and long-term debt include buyback probability, cor-\nrelation, credit spread, gap risk, mean reversion, price, recovery \nrate and volatility.\n\nGenerally, the interrelationships between correlation, credit \nspread, gap risk and volatility inputs are positively correlated.\n\nOther liabilities\nFailed sales\nThese liabilities represent the financing of assets that did not \nachieve sale accounting treatment under US GAAP.

As a result, the unrealized gains and losses for assets and \nliabilities within level\xc2\xa03 presented in the table above may include \nchanges in fair value that were attributable to both observable \nand unobservable inputs.\n\nThe Group employs various economic hedging techniques in order \nto manage risks, including risks in level\xc2\xa03 positions. Such tech-\nniques may include the purchase or sale of financial instruments \nthat are classified in levels\xc2\xa01 and/or 2. The realized and unrealized \ngains and losses for assets and liabilities in level\xc2\xa03 presented in \nthe table above do not reflect the related realized or unrealized \ngains and losses arising on economic hedging instruments classi-\nfied in levels\xc2\xa01 and/or 2.\n\nTransfers in and out of level 3\n\nTransfers into level\xc2\xa03 assets during 2018 were CHF\xc2\xa02,872 mil-\nlion, primarily from trading assets and loans. The transfers were \nprimarily in the financing and credit businesses due to limited \nobservability of pricing data and reduced pricing information from \nexternal providers. Transfers out of level\xc2\xa03 assets during 2018 \nwere CHF\xc2\xa02,424 million, primarily in trading assets and loans. \nThe transfers out of level\xc2\xa03 assets were primarily in the financ-\ning and fixed income businesses due to improved observability of \npricing data and increased availability of pricing information from \nexternal providers.\n\nTransfers into level\xc2\xa03 assets during 2017 were CHF\xc2\xa02,702 mil-\nlion, primarily from trading assets and loans. The transfers were \nprimarily in the credit, financing and fixed income businesses due \nto limited observability of pricing data and reduced pricing infor-\nmation from external providers. Transfers out of level\xc2\xa03 assets \nduring 2017 were CHF\xc2\xa03,165 million, primarily in trading assets \nand loans. The transfers out of level\xc2\xa03 assets were primarily in \nthe Strategic Resolution Unit and financing businesses due to \nimproved observability of pricing data and increased availability of \npricing information from external providers.\n\nUncertainty of fair value measurements at \nthe reporting date from the use of significant \nunobservable inputs\n\nFor level\xc2\xa03 assets with a significant unobservable input of buy-\nback probability, correlation, contingent probability, EBITDA mul-\ntiple, funding spread, mortality rate, price, volatility or volatility \nskew, in general, an increase in the significant unobservable input \nwould increase the fair value. For level\xc2\xa03 assets with a signifi-\ncant unobservable input of default rate, capitalization rate, credit \ncurve for corporates or sovereigns, credit spread, discount rate, \ngap risk, market implied life expectancy (for life settlement and \npremium finance instruments), prepayment rate and recovery rate, \nin general, an increase in the significant unobservable input would \ndecrease the fair value.\n\nFor level\xc2\xa03 liabilities, in general, an increase in the related sig-\nnificant unobservable inputs would have the inverse impact on \nfair value. An increase in the significant unobservable input \ncredit spread, contingent probability, gap risk, market implied life \nexpectancy (for life settlement and premium finance instruments) \nand mortality would increase the fair value. An increase in the \nsignificant unobservable input basis spread, buyback probability, \ncorrelation, discount rate, fund gap risk, funding spread, mortal-\nity rate, prepayment rate, price, recovery rate and volatility would \ndecrease the fair value.\n\nInterrelationships between significant \nunobservable inputs\n\nExcept as noted above, there are no material interrelationships \nbetween the significant unobservable inputs for the financial \ninstruments. As the significant unobservable inputs move inde-\npendently, generally an increase or decrease in one significant \nunobservable input will have no impact on the other significant \nunobservable inputs.\n\nQuantitative disclosures of valuation techniques\n\nThe following tables provide the representative range of minimum \nand maximum values and the associated weighted averages of \neach

financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nQualitative discussion of the ranges of significant \nunobservable inputs\n\nThe following sections provide further information about the \nranges of significant unobservable inputs included in the tables \nabove. The level of aggregation and diversity within the financial \ninstruments disclosed in the tables above results in certain ranges \nof significant inputs being wide and unevenly distributed across \nasset and liability categories.\n\nBasis spread\nBasis spread is the primary significant unobservable input for \nnon-callable constant maturity treasury-CMS products and is \nused to determine interest rate risk as a result of differing lending \nand borrowing rates.\n\nBuyback probability\nBuyback probability is the probability assigned to structured notes \nbeing unwound prior to their legal maturity.\n\nCapitalization rate\nCapitalization rate is the primary significant unobservable input \nfor CMBS loans and is used to estimate the potential return on \ninvestment. This is done by dividing the yearly income by the total \nvalue of the property.\n\nContingent probability\nContingent probability is the primary significant unobservable \ninput for contingent foreign exchange forward trades where the \ndelivery or exercise and the premium payment are contingent \non an event such as completion of an M&A deal or regulatory \napproval for a product.\n\nCorrelation\nThere are many different types of correlation inputs, including \ncredit correlation, cross-asset correlation (such as equity-inter-\nest rate correlation) and same-asset correlation (such as interest \nrate-interest rate correlation). Correlation inputs are generally \nused to value hybrid and exotic instruments. Due to the complex \nand unique nature of these instruments, the ranges for correlation \ninputs can vary widely across portfolios.\n\nCredit spread and recovery rate\nFor financial instruments where credit spread is the significant \nunobservable input, the wide range represents positions with \nvarying levels of risk. The lower end of the credit spread range \ntypically represents shorter-dated instruments and/or those with \nbetter perceived credit risk. The higher end of the range typically \ncomprises longer-dated financial instruments or those referencing \nnon-performing, distressed or impaired reference credits. Simi-\nlarly, the spread between the reference credit and an index can \nvary significantly based on the risk of the instrument. The spread \nwill be positive for instruments that have a higher risk of default \nthan the index (which is based on a weighted average of its com-\nponents) and negative for instruments that have a lower risk of \ndefault than the index.\n\nSimilarly, recovery rates can vary significantly depending upon the \nspecific assets and terms of each transaction. Transactions with \nhigher seniority or more valuable collateral will have higher recov-\nery rates, while those transactions which are more subordinated \nor with less valuable collateral will have lower recovery rates.\n\nDefault rate and loss severity\nFor financial instruments backed by residential real estate or other \nassets, diversity in the portfolio is reflected in a wide range for \nloss severity due to varying levels of default. The lower end of the \nrange represents high performing or government guaranteed col-\nlateral with a low PD or guaranteed timely payment of principal \nand interest, while the higher end of the range relates to collateral \nwith a greater risk of default.\n\nDiscount rate\nThe discount rate is the rate of interest used to calculate the \npresent value of the expected cash flows of a financial instru-\nment. There are multiple factors that will impact the discount rate \nfor any given financial instrument including the coupon on the \ninstrument, the term and the underlying risk of the expected cash \nflows. Two instruments of similar term and expected cash flows \nmay have significantly different discount rates because the cou-\npons on the instruments are different.\n\nEBITDA multiple\nEBITDA multiple is a primary significant unobservable input for \nsome equity deals which are benchmarked using industry com-\nparables. The EBITDA multiple may be preferred over other \nmeasures because it is normalized for differences between the \naccounting policies of similar companies.\n\nFunding spread\nFunding spread is the primary significant unobservable input for \nspecial purpose vehicle funding facilities. Synthetic funding curves \nwhich represent the assets pledged as collateral are used to value \nstructured financing transactions. The curves provide an estimate \nof where secured funding can be sourced and are expressed as a \nbasis point spread in relation to the referenced benchmark rate.\n\nGap risk\nGap risk is the primary significant unobservable input for fund-\nlinked Constant Proportion Portfolio Insurance products and \nstructures where the payoff may be sensitive to discontinuity in \nthe hedging portfolio.\n\nMarket implied life expectancy\nMarket implied life expectancy is the primary significant unobserv-\nable input on such products as life settlement, premium finance \nand SPIA, and represents the estimated mortality rate for the \nunderlying insured for each contract. This estimate may vary \ndepending upon multiple factors including the age and specific \nhealth characteristics of the insured.\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n379\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nMean reversion\nMean reversion is the primary significant unobservable input for \ncallable constant maturity swap (CMS) spread exotics and rep-\nresents the idea that prices and returns eventually move back \ntowards the historical average.\n\nMortality rate\nMortality rate is the primary significant unobservable input for \npension swaps. The expected present value of future cash flow \nof the trades depend on the mortality of individuals in the pen-\nsion fund who are grouped into categories such as gender, age, \npension amount and other factors. In some cases mortality rates \ninclude a \xe2\x80\x9cscaler\xe2\x80\x9d (also referred to as a loading or multiplier) that \nalign mortality projections with historical experience and calibrate \nto exit level.\n\nPrepayment rate\nPrepayment rates may vary from collateral pool to collateral pool, \nand are driven by a variety of collateral-specific factors, including \nthe type and location of the underlying borrower, the remaining \ntenor of the obligation and the level and type (e.g., fixed or float-\ning) of interest rate being paid by the borrower.\n\nVolatility and volatility skew\nVolatility and its skew are both impacted by the underlying risk, \nterm and strike price of the derivative. In the case of interest \nrate derivatives, volatility may vary significantly between differ-\nent underlying currencies and expiration dates on the options. \nSimilarly, in the case of equity derivatives, the volatility attributed \nto a structure may vary depending upon the underlying reference \nname on the derivative.\n\nInvestment funds measured at NAV per share\n\nInvestments in funds held in trading assets and trading liabili-\nties primarily include positions held in equity funds of funds as an \neconomic hedge for structured notes and derivatives issued to \nclients that reference the same underlying risk and liquidity terms \nof the fund. A majority of these funds have limitations imposed \non the amount of withdrawals from the fund during the redemp-\ntion period due to illiquidity of the investments. In other instances, \nthe withdrawal amounts may vary depending on the redemption \nnotice period and are usually larger for the longer redemption \nnotice periods. In addition, penalties may apply if redemption is \nwithin a certain time period from initial investment.\n\nPrice\nBond equivalent price is a primary significant unobservable input \nfor multiple products. Where market prices are not available for \nan instrument, benchmarking may be utilized to identify com-\nparable issues (same industry and similar product mixes) while \nadjustments are considered for differences in deal terms and \nperformance.\n\nInvestments in funds held in other investments principally involves \nprivate equity securities and, to a lesser extent, publicly traded \nsecurities and fund of funds. Several of these investments have \nredemption restrictions subject to the discretion of the board \nof directors of the fund and/or redemption is permitted without \nrestriction, but is limited to a certain percentage of total assets or \nonly after a certain date.\n\nTerm TRS/repo spread\nFor financial instruments where TRS/repo spread is the signifi-\ncant unobservable input, the range represents positions with \nvarying levels of risk. The lower end of the spread range typically \nrepresents shorter-dated instruments and/or those with better \nperceived credit and funding risk. The higher end of the range \ntypically comprises longer-dated financial instruments or those \nreferencing collateral with lower liquidity or collateral correlated to \nthe counterparty.\n\nFor those funds held in trading assets and trading liabilities and \nfunds held in other investments that are nonredeemable, the \nunderlying assets of such funds are expected to be liquidated \nover the life of the fund, which is generally up to ten years.\n\nThe following table pertains to investments in certain entities that \ncalculate NAV per share or its equivalent, primarily private equity \nand hedge funds. These investments do not have a readily deter-\nminable fair value and are measured at fair value using NAV.\n\n380\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nFair value, unfunded commitments and term of redemption conditions of investment funds measured at NAV per share\n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \nend of\xc2\xa0 \n\n   \n   \nments    redeemable    Redeemable   \n\n   \n   \nredeemable    Redeemable   \n\n2018   \n    Unfunded   \ncommit-   \n\n2017 \n    Unfunded \ncommit- \nments \n\nTotal   \nfair value   \n\nTotal   \nfair value   \n\n           \n   \nNon-   \n\n           \n   \nNon-   \n\nFair value of investment funds and unfunded commitments (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \n \n \n12   \nDebt funds\xc2\xa0 \n103   \nEquity funds\xc2\xa0 \n(8)   \nEquity funds sold short\xc2\xa0 \n107   \nFunds held in trading assets and trading liabilities\xc2\xa0 \n1   \nDebt funds\xc2\xa0 \n130   \nEquity funds\xc2\xa0 \n214   \nReal estate funds\xc2\xa0 \n24   \nOther private equity funds\xc2\xa0 \n369   \nPrivate equity funds\xc2\xa0 \n68   \nDebt funds\xc2\xa0 \n14   \nEquity funds\xc2\xa0 \n2   \nOther hedge funds\xc2\xa0 \n84   \nHedge funds\xc2\xa0 \n52   \nEquity method investment funds\xc2\xa0 \nFunds held in other investments\xc2\xa0 \n505   \nTotal fair value of investment funds and unfunded commitments\xc2\xa0  612   5 \n\n0   \n1,011   1 \n(2)   \n1,009   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n5   \n5   \n34   \n14   \n24   \n72   3 \n522   \n599   \n1,608   \n\n12   \n1,114   \n(10)   \n1,116   \n1   \n130   \n214   \n29   \n374   \n102   \n28   \n26   \n156   \n574   \n1,104   \n2,220   \n\n0   \n53   \n0   \n53   \n0   \n43   \n34   \n29   \n106   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n21   \n127   \n180   7 \n\n0   \n61   \n0   \n61   \n1   \n141   \n178   \n31   \n351   \n164   \n2   \n2   \n168   \n71   \n590   \n651   5 \n\n0   \n992   2 \n(9)   \n983   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n0   \n75   \n53   \n95   \n223   4 \n1,051   \n1,274   \n2,257   6 \n\n0   \n1,053   \n(9)   \n1,044   \n1   \n141   \n178   \n31   \n351   \n239   \n55   \n97   \n391   \n1,122   \n1,864   \n2,908   \n\n  \n  \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n0 \n64 \n44 \n15 \n123 \n0 \n0 \n9 \n9 \n5 \n137 \n137   7\n\n1 46% of the redeemable fair value amount of equity funds is redeemable on demand with a notice period primarily of less than 30 days, 40% is redeemable on a monthly basis with a \n\nnotice period of primarily more than 30 days, 13% is redeemable on a quarterly basis with a notice period primarily of more than 45 days and 1% is redeemable on an annual basis with a \nnotice period of less than 30 days.\n\n2 54% of the redeemable fair value amount of equity funds is redeemable on demand with a notice period primarily of less than 30 days, 35% is redeemable on a monthly basis with a \n\nnotice period primarily of less than 30 days, 9% is redeemable on a quarterly basis with a notice period primarily of more than 45 days and 2% is redeemable on an annual basis with a \nnotice period of more than 60 days.\n\n3 65% of the redeemable fair value amount of hedge funds is redeemable on a quarterly basis with a notice period primarily of more than 60 days and 35% is redeemable on demand with \n\na notice period primarily of less than 30 days.\n\n4 51% of the redeemable fair value amount of hedge funds is redeemable on a quarterly basis with a notice period primarily of more than 45 days, 43% is redeemable on a monthly basis \n\nwith a notice period primarily of less than 30 days and 6% is redeemable on demand with a notice period primarily of less than 30 days.\n\n5 Includes CHF 102 million and CHF 229 million attributable to noncontrolling interests as of the end of 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n6 Includes CHF 167 million attributable to noncontrolling interests as of the end of 2017.\n7 Includes CHF 23 million and CHF 53 million attributable to noncontrolling interests as of the end of 2018 and 2017, respectively.\n\nAssets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring \nbasis\n\nAssets measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis\nend of\xc2\xa0 \n\n2018   \n\nCertain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a non-\nrecurring basis; that is, they are not measured at fair value on an \nongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain \ncircumstances, for example, when there is evidence of impair-\nment. Nonrecurring measurements are completed as of the end \nof the period unless otherwise stated.\n\n \n\nCHF billion\xc2\xa0 \nAssets held-for-sale recorded at fair value\xc2\xa0 \non a nonrecurring basis\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which level 2\xc2\xa0 \n\n \n\n \n\n   \n0.0   \n0.0   \n\n2017 \n\n \n0.1 \n0.1 \n\nThe Group typically uses nonfinancial assets measured at fair \nvalue on a recurring or nonrecurring basis in a manner that \nreflects their highest and best use.\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n381\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nFair value option\n\nThe Group has availed itself of the simplification in accounting \noffered under the fair value option. This has been accomplished \ngenerally by electing the fair value option, both at initial adoption \nand for subsequent transactions, on items impacted by the hedge \naccounting requirements of US GAAP. For instruments for which \nhedge accounting could not be achieved but for which the Group \nis economically hedged, the Group has generally elected the \nfair value option. Where the Group manages an activity on a fair \nvalue basis but previously has been unable to achieve fair value \naccounting, the Group has generally utilized the fair value option \nto align its financial accounting to its risk management reporting.\n\nThe Group elected fair value for certain of its financial statement \ncaptions as follows:\n\nCentral bank funds sold, securities purchased \nunder resale agreements and securities \nborrowing transactions\n\nThe Group has elected to account for structured resale agree-\nments and most matched book resale agreements at fair value. \nThese activities are managed on a fair value basis; thus, fair value \naccounting is deemed more appropriate for reporting purposes. \nThe Group did not elect the fair value option for firm financing \nresale agreements as these agreements are generally overnight \nagreements which approximate fair value, but which are not man-\naged on a fair value basis.\n\nOther investments\n\nThe Group has elected to account for certain equity method \ninvestments at fair value. These activities are managed on a fair \nvalue basis; thus, fair value accounting is deemed more appro-\npriate for reporting purposes. Certain similar instruments, such \nas those relating to equity method investments in strategic rela-\ntionships, for example, the Group\xe2\x80\x99s ownership interest in certain \nclearance organizations, which were eligible for the fair value \noption, were not elected due to the strategic relationship.\n\nLoans\n\nThe Group has elected to account for substantially all commercial \nloans and loan commitments from the investment banking busi-\nnesses and certain emerging market loans from the investment \nbanking businesses at fair value. These activities are managed \non a fair value basis and fair value accounting was deemed more \nappropriate for reporting purposes. Additionally, recognition on a \nfair value basis eliminates the mismatch that existed due to the \neconomic hedging the Group employs to manage these loans. \nCertain similar loans, such as project finance, lease finance, cash \ncollateralized and some bridge loans, which were eligible for the \nfair value option, were not elected due to the lack of currently \navailable infrastructure to fair value such loans and/or the inability \nto economically hedge such loans. Additionally, the Group elected \nnot to account for loans granted by its private, corporate and \n\n382\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\ninstitutional banking businesses at fair value, such as domes-\ntic consumer lending, mortgages and corporate loans, as these \nloans are not managed on a fair value basis.\n\nOther assets\n\nThe Group elected the fair value option for loans held-for-sale, \ndue to the short period over which such loans are held and the \nintention to sell such loans in the near term. Other assets also \ninclude assets of VIEs and mortgage securitizations which do not \nmeet the criteria for sale treatment under US GAAP. The Group \ndid elect the fair value option for these types of transactions.\n\nDue to banks and customer deposits\n\nThe Group elected the fair value option for certain time depos-\nits associated with its emerging markets activities. The Group\xe2\x80\x99s \ncustomer deposits include fund-linked deposits. The Group \nelected the fair value option for these fund-linked deposits. Fund-\nlinked products are managed on a fair value basis and fair value \naccounting was deemed more appropriate for reporting purposes.\n\nCentral bank funds purchased, securities sold \nunder repurchase agreements and securities \nlending transactions\n\nThe Group has elected to account for structured repurchase \nagreements and most matched book repurchase agreements at \nfair value. These activities are managed on a fair value basis and \nfair value accounting was deemed more appropriate for report-\ning purposes. The Group did not elect the fair value option for \nfirm financing repurchase agreements as these agreements are \ngenerally overnight agreements which approximate fair value, but \nwhich are not managed on a fair value basis.\n\nShort-term borrowings\n\nThe Group\xe2\x80\x99s short-term borrowings include hybrid debt instru-\nments with embedded derivative features. Some of these embed-\nded derivative features create bifurcatable debt instruments. The \nGroup elected the fair value option for some of these instruments \nas of January 1, 2006, in accordance with the provisions of US \nGAAP. New bifurcatable debt instruments which were entered \ninto in 2006 are carried at fair value. Some hybrid debt instru-\nments do not result in bifurcatable debt instruments. US GAAP \npermits the Group to elect fair value accounting for non-bifur-\ncatable hybrid debt instruments. With the exception of certain \nbifurcatable hybrid debt instruments which the Group did not elect \nto account for at fair value, the Group has elected to account \nfor all hybrid debt instruments held as of January 1, 2007, and \nhybrid debt instruments originated after January 1, 2007, at fair \nvalue. These activities are managed on a fair value basis and \nfair value accounting was deemed appropriate for reporting pur-\nposes. There are two main populations of similar instruments for \nwhich fair value accounting was not elected. The first relates to \nthe lending business transacted by the Group\xe2\x80\x99s private, corporate \nand institutional banking businesses, which includes structured \n\n\x0c \n\n \n\ndeposits and similar investment products. These are managed \non a bifurcated or accrual basis and fair value accounting was \nnot considered appropriate. The second is where the instruments \nwere or will be maturing in the near term and their fair value will \nbe realized at that time.\n\nLong-term debt\n\nThe Group\xe2\x80\x99s long-term debt includes hybrid debt instruments with \nembedded derivative features as described above in short-term \nborrowings. The Group\xe2\x80\x99s long-term debt also includes debt issu-\nances managed by the Treasury department that do not contain \nderivative features (vanilla debt). The Group actively manages the \ninterest rate risk on these instruments with derivatives. In par-\nticular, fixed-rate debt is hedged with receive-fixed, pay-floating \n\ninterest rate swaps. The Group elected to fair value fixed-rate \ndebt upon implementation of the fair value option on January 1, \n2007, with changes in fair value recognized as a component of \ntrading revenues. The Group did not elect to apply the fair value \noption to fixed-rate debt issued by the Group since January 1, \n2008, but instead applies hedge accounting.\n\nOther liabilities\n\nOther liabilities include liabilities of VIEs and mortgage securiti-\nzations that do not meet the criteria for sale treatment under US \nGAAP. The Group elected the fair value option for these types of \ntransactions.\n\nDifference between the aggregate fair value and unpaid principal balances of fair value option-elected financial \ninstruments\n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \nend of\xc2\xa0 \n\n    Aggregate    Aggregate   \n   \nunpaid   \nprincipal    Difference   \n\nAggregate    Aggregate   \nunpaid   \n\nfair   \nvalue   \n\nfair   \nvalue   \n\n2018   \n\n       \n\n       \n\n2017 \n \n \nprincipal    Difference \n\nFinancial instruments (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \n \n \nCentral bank funds sold, securities purchased under\xc2\xa0 \nresale agreements and securities borrowing transactions\xc2\xa0 \nLoans\xc2\xa0 \nOther assets\xc2\xa01 \n\nDue to banks and customer deposits\xc2\xa0 \nCentral bank funds purchased, securities sold under\xc2\xa0 \nrepurchase agreements and securities lending transactions\xc2\xa0 \nShort-term borrowings\xc2\xa0 \nLong-term debt\xc2\xa0 \nOther liabilities\xc2\xa0 \n\n\xc2\xa0 \nNon-performing and non-interest-earning loans\xc2\xa02 \n\n1 Primarily loans held-for-sale.\n2 Included in loans or other assets.\n\n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n\n   \n81,818   \n14,873   \n6,706   \n\n(859)   \n   \n(14,828)   \n(8,068)   \n(63,935)   \n(2,068)   \n\n   \n81,637   \n15,441   \n9,240   \n\n(778)   \n   \n(14,827)   \n(8,647)   \n(70,883)   \n(3,125)   \n\n   \n181   \n(568)   \n(2,534)   \n\n(81)   \n   \n(1)   \n579   \n6,948   \n1,057   \n\n   \n77,498   \n15,307   \n8,468   \n\n(907)   \n   \n(15,262)   \n(11,019)   \n(63,628)   \n(661)   \n\n   \n76,643   \n15,372   \n10,910   \n\n(861)   \n   \n(15,180)   \n(11,104)   \n(63,759)   \n(1,716)   \n\n \n855 \n(65) \n(2,442) \n\n(46) \n \n(82) \n85 \n131 \n1,055 \n\n   \n640   \n\n   \n3,493   \n\n   \n(2,853)   \n\n   \n708   \n\n   \n3,375   \n\n \n\n(2,667) \n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n383\n\n\x0c \n\nGains and losses on financial instruments\n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \nin\xc2\xa0 \n\nFinancial instruments (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \n \n \nInterest-bearing deposits with banks\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which related to credit risk\xc2\xa0 \nCentral bank funds sold, securities purchased under\xc2\xa0 \nresale agreements and securities borrowing transactions\xc2\xa0 \nOther investments\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which related to credit risk\xc2\xa0 \nLoans\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which related to credit risk\xc2\xa0 \nOther assets\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which related to credit risk\xc2\xa0 \nDue to banks and customer deposits\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which related to credit risk\xc2\xa0 \nCentral bank funds purchased, securities sold under\xc2\xa0 \nrepurchase agreements and securities lending transactions\xc2\xa0 \nShort-term borrowings\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which related to credit risk\xc2\xa0 \nLong-term debt\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which related to credit risk\xc2\xa0 \nOther liabilities\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which related to credit risk\xc2\xa0 \n\n1 Primarily recognized in net interest income.\n2 Primarily recognized in trading revenues.\n3 Primarily recognized in other revenues.\n4 Prior period has been corrected.\n\n \n\n \n\n2016 \nNet \ngains/ \n(losses) \n\n \n \n4   1\n1 \n \n1,440   1\n212   2\n(3) \n1,643   1\n(16) \n(518)   2\n(199) \n(12)   1\n(22) \n \n(112)   1\n323   2\n(4) \n(1,235)   2\n22 \n456   2\n306 \n\n2018   \nNet   \ngains/   \n(losses)   \n\n2017   \nNet   \ngains/   \n(losses)   \n\n2   1 \n(10)   \n   \n2,451   1 \n241   3 \n(1)   \n717   1 \n(296)   \n770   1 \n61   \n(39)   2 \n(37)   \n   \n(890)   1 \n2,807   2 \n(5)   \n4,206   2 \n7   \n73   3 \n4   \n\n13   1 \n0   \n   \n\n2,206   1,4 \n216   2 \n(4)   \n1,542   1 \n7   \n480   1 \n96   \n1   2 \n5   \n   \n\n(418)   1,4 \n(512)   2 \n(23)   \n(6,857)   2 \n(32)   \n183   3 \n83   \n\nThe impact of credit risk on assets presented in the table above \nhas been calculated as the component of the total change in fair \nvalue, excluding the impact of changes in base or risk-free inter-\nest rates.

The legislation imple-\nmenting the Basel\xc2\xa0III framework in Switzerland in respect of capital \nrequirements for systemically relevant banks, including the Group, \ngoes beyond the Basel\xc2\xa0III minimum standards for systemically \nrelevant banks. The Swiss total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) \nstandards are being phased in from 2016 through 2019 and are \nfully effective on January\xc2\xa01, 2020. The Group, which is subject to \nregulation by FINMA, has based its capital adequacy calculations \non US GAAP financial statements, as permitted by FINMA Circular \n2013/1.\n\nThe Swiss regulation framework includes certain requirements for \nSwiss banks classified as systemically important banks operating \ninternationally, such as the Group. It contains two different mini-\nmum requirements for loss-absorbing capacity: global systemically \nimportant banks must hold sufficient capital that absorbs losses to \nensure continuity of service (going concern requirement), and they \nmust issue sufficient debt instruments to fund an orderly resolution \nwithout recourse to public resources (gone concern requirement). \nGoing concern capital and gone concern capital together form \nthe Group\xe2\x80\x99s total loss-absorbing capacity. The going concern and \ngone concern requirements are generally aligned with the Financial \nStability Board\xe2\x80\x99s total loss-absorbing capacity standard. The Swiss \nrequirements are subject to phase-in and grandfathering provisions \nfor certain outstanding instruments, and have to be fully applied by \nJanuary 1, 2020. Banks that do not maintain the minimum require-\nments may be limited in their ability to pay dividends and make dis-\ncretionary bonus payments and other earnings distributions.\n\nThe Group\xe2\x80\x99s balance sheet positions and off-balance sheet expo-\nsures translate into risk-weighted assets, which are categorized \nas credit, market and operational risk-weighted assets. When \nassessing risk-weighted assets, it is not the nominal size, but \nrather the nature (including risk mitigation such as collateral or \nhedges) of the balance sheet positions or off-balance sheet expo-\nsures that determines the risk-weighted assets.\n\nLeverage exposure consists of period-end balance sheet assets \nand prescribed regulatory adjustments.\n\nCapital ratios measure the Group\xe2\x80\x99s capital components against \nrisk-weighted assets and leverage ratios measure them against \nthe end-of-period leverage exposure.\n\nAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the Group\xe2\x80\x99s capital position \nexceeds its capital requirements under the regulatory provisions \noutlined under Swiss Requirements.\n\nBroker-dealer operations\n\nCertain of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s broker-dealer subsidiaries are also subject \nto capital adequacy requirements. As of December 31, 2018 and \n2017, the Group and its subsidiaries complied with all applicable \nregulatory capital adequacy requirements. \n\nSwiss metrics\n\xc2\xa0 \nend of\xc2\xa0 \n\nSwiss capital (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \nSwiss CET1 capital\xc2\xa0 \nGoing concern capital\xc2\xa0 \nGone concern capital\xc2\xa0 \nTotal loss-absorbing capacity\xc2\xa0 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n   \n2018   \n\nPhase-in \n2017 \n\n35,719   \n49,443   \n35,678   \n85,121   \n\n36,567 \n53,131 \n35,712 \n88,843 \n\nSwiss risk-weighted assets and leverage exposure (CHF million)\xc2\xa0  \n \n285,193   \nSwiss risk-weighted assets\xc2\xa0 \nLeverage exposure\xc2\xa0 \n881,386   \n\n \n\n273,436 \n919,053 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSwiss capital ratios (%)\xc2\xa0 \nSwiss CET1 ratio\xc2\xa0 \nGoing concern capital ratio\xc2\xa0 \nGone concern capital ratio\xc2\xa0 \nTLAC ratio\xc2\xa0 \n\nSwiss leverage ratios (%)\xc2\xa0 \nSwiss CET1 leverage ratio\xc2\xa0 \nGoing concern leverage ratio\xc2\xa0 \nGone concern leverage ratio\xc2\xa0 \nTLAC leverage ratio\xc2\xa0 \n\nSwiss capital ratio requirements (%)\xc2\xa0 \nSwiss CET1 ratio requirement\xc2\xa0 \nGoing concern capital ratio requirement\xc2\xa0 \nGone concern capital ratio requirement\xc2\xa0 \nTLAC ratio requirement\xc2\xa0 \n\nSwiss leverage ratio requirements (%)\xc2\xa0 \nSwiss CET1 leverage ratio requirement\xc2\xa0 \nGoing concern leverage ratio requirement\xc2\xa0 \nGone concern leverage ratio requirement\xc2\xa0 \nTLAC leverage ratio requirement\xc2\xa0 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n12.5   \n17.3   \n12.5   \n29.8   \n\n4.1   \n5.6   \n4.0   \n9.7   \n\n9.46   \n12.86   \n8.9   \n21.76   \n\n \n\n \n\n2.9   \n4.0   \n3.0   \n7.0   \n\n13.4 \n19.4 \n13.1 \n32.5 \n\n4.0 \n5.8 \n3.9 \n9.7 \n\n9.0 \n12.0 \n6.2 \n18.2 \n\n2.6 \n3.5 \n2.0 \n5.5 \n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n387\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nDividend restrictions\n\nCertain of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s subsidiaries are subject to legal restric-\ntions governing the amount of dividends they can pay (for exam-\nple, pursuant to corporate law as defined by the Swiss Code of \nObligations).\n\nat least 5% of the annual net profits must be retained and booked \nas general legal reserves for so long as these reserves amount \nto less than 20% of the paid-in share capital.

The classification of assets under management is condi-\ntional upon the nature of the services provided by the Group and \nthe clients\xe2\x80\x99 intentions. Assets are individually assessed on the \nbasis of each client\xe2\x80\x99s intentions and objectives and the nature of \nthe banking services provided to that client. In order to be clas-\nsified as assets under management, the Group must currently or \nin the foreseeable future expect to provide a service where the \ninvolvement of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s banking or investment expertise (e.g. \nas asset manager or investment advisor) is not purely executional \nor custodial in nature. \n\nAssets under custody are client assets held mainly for execution-\nrelated or safekeeping/custody purposes only and therefore are \nnot considered assets under management since the Group does \nnot generally provide asset allocation or financial advice.\n\nAssets of corporate clients and public institutions that are used \nprimarily for cash management or transaction executional pur-\nposes for which no investment advice is provided are classified as \ncommercial assets or assets under custody and therefore do not \nqualify as assets under management.\n\nFor the purpose of classifying assets under management, clients \nwith multiple accounts are assessed from an overall relationship \nperspective. Accounts that are clearly separate from the remain-\nder of the client relationship and represent assets held for custody \npurposes only are not included as assets under management.\n\n388\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\nThe initial classification of the assets may not be permanent as \nthe nature of the client relationship is reassessed on an on-going \nbasis. If changes in client intent or activity warrant reclassifica-\ntion between client asset categories, the required reclassifica-\ntion adjustments are made immediately when the change in \nintent or activity occurs. Reclassifications between assets under \nmanagement and assets held for transaction-related or custodial \npurposes result in corresponding net asset inflows or outflows. \nEffective as of January 1, 2019, the Group updated its assets \nunder management policy primarily to introduce more specific \ncriteria to evaluate whether client assets qualify as assets under \nmanagement. The introduction of this updated policy is expected \nto result in a reclassification of approximately CHF\xc2\xa019 billion of \nassets under management to assets under custody which will be \nreflected as a structural effect in the first quarter of 2019.\n\nA portion of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s assets under management results from \ndouble counting. Double counting arises when assets under man-\nagement are subject to more than one level of asset management \nservices. Each separate advisory or discretionary service provides \nadditional benefits to the client and represents additional income \nfor the Group. Specifically, double counting primarily results from \nthe investment of assets under management in collective invest-\nment instruments managed by the Group. The extent of double \ncounting is disclosed in the following table.\n\nAssets under management\nend of\xc2\xa0 \n\n \n\n \n\nCHF billion\xc2\xa0 \nAssets in collective investment \xc2\xa0 \ninstruments managed by Credit Suisse\xc2\xa0 \nAssets with discretionary mandates\xc2\xa0 \nOther assets under management\xc2\xa0 \nAssets under management \xc2\xa0 \n(including double counting)\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which double counting\xc2\xa0 \n\n \n\n2018   \n\n2017 \n\n   \n186.4   \n256.5   \n904.4   \n   \n1,347.3   \n44.2   \n\n \n185.2 \n267.3 \n923.6 \n \n1,376.1 \n46.2 \n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nChanges in assets under management\n\xc2\xa0 \n\nAssets under management (CHF billion)\xc2\xa0 \n \nBalance at beginning of period\xc2\xa01 \nNet new assets/(net asset outflows)\xc2\xa0 \nMarket movements, interest, dividends and foreign exchange\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which market movements, interest and dividends\xc2\xa02 \n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0of which foreign exchange\xc2\xa0 \nOther effects\xc2\xa0 \nBalance at end of period\xc2\xa0 \n\n1 Including double counting.\n2 Net of commissions and other expenses and net of interest expenses charged.\n\n2018   \n\n2017 \n\n \n\n \n\n1,376.1   \n56.5   \n(68.2)   \n(55.1)   \n(13.1)   \n(17.1)   \n1,347.3   \n\n1,251.1 \n37.8 \n86.7 \n88.9 \n(2.2) \n0.5 \n1,376.1 \n\nNet new assets\n\nDivisional allocation\n\nNet new assets measure the degree of success in acquiring assets \nunder management or changes in assets under management \nthrough warranted reclassifications. The calculation is based on \nthe direct method, taking into account individual cash payments, \nsecurity deliveries and cash flows resulting from loan increases or \nrepayments. \n\nInterest and dividend income credited to clients and commissions, \ninterest and fees charged for banking services as well as changes \nin assets under management due to currency and market volatil-\nity are not taken into account when calculating net new assets, as \nsuch charges or market movements are not directly related to the \nGroup\xe2\x80\x99s success in acquiring assets under management. Similarly \nother effects mainly relate to asset inflows and outflows due to \nacquisition or divestiture, exit from businesses or markets or exits \ndue to new regulatory requirements and are not taken into account \nwhen calculating net new assets. The Group reviews relevant poli-\ncies regarding client assets on a regular basis.\n\nAssets under management and net new assets for the Private \nClients business in the Swiss Universal Bank division, the Private \nBanking businesses in the International Wealth Management and \nAsia Pacific divisions, the Corporate & Institutional Banking busi-\nness in the Swiss Universal Bank division and the Strategic Reso-\nlution Unit are allocated based on the management areas (busi-\nness areas) that effectively manage the assets. The distribution \nof net new assets resulting from internal referral arrangements \nis governed under the net new asset referral framework, which \nincludes preset percentages for the allocation of net new assets \nto the businesses.\n\nThe allocation of assets under management and net new assets \nfor Asset Management in the Internal Wealth Management divi-\nsion reflects the location where the investment vehicles are man-\naged and where the costs of managing the funds are incurred.\n\n39  Litigation \n\nThe Group is involved in a number of judicial, regulatory and arbi-\ntration proceedings concerning matters arising in connection with \nthe conduct of its businesses, including those disclosed below. \nSome of these proceedings have been brought on behalf of vari-\nous classes of claimants and seek damages of material and/or \nindeterminate amounts.\n\nGroup reviews its legal proceedings each quarter to determine the \nadequacy of its litigation provisions and may increase or release \nprovisions based on management\xe2\x80\x99s judgment and the advice of \ncounsel. The establishment of additional provisions or releases of \nlitigation provisions may be necessary in the future as develop-\nments in such proceedings warrant.\n\nThe Group accrues loss contingency litigation provisions and \ntakes a charge to income in connection with certain proceedings \nwhen losses, additional losses or ranges of loss are probable and \nreasonably estimable. The Group also accrues litigation provisions \nfor the estimated fees and expenses of external lawyers and \nother service providers in relation to such proceedings, including \nin cases for which it has not accrued a loss contingency provision. \nThe Group accrues these fee and expense litigation provisions \nand takes a charge to income in connection therewith when such \nfees and expenses are probable and reasonably estimable. The \n\nThe specific matters described below include (a) proceedings \nwhere the Group has accrued a loss contingency provision, given \nthat it is probable that a loss may be incurred and such loss is \nreasonably estimable; and (b) proceedings where the Group has \nnot accrued such a loss contingency provision for various rea-\nsons, including, but not limited to, the fact that any related losses \nare not reasonably estimable. The description of certain of the \nmatters below includes a statement that the Group has estab-\nlished a loss contingency provision and discloses the amount of \nsuch provision; for the other matters no such statement is made. \n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n389\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nWith respect to the matters for which no such statement is made, \neither (a) the Group has not established a loss contingency provi-\nsion, in which case the matter is treated as a contingent liability \nunder the applicable accounting standard, or (b) the Group has \nestablished such a provision but believes that disclosure of that \nfact would violate confidentiality obligations to which the Group \nis subject or otherwise compromise attorney-client privilege, \nwork product protection or other protections against disclosure or \ncompromise the Group\xe2\x80\x99s management of the matter. The future \noutflow of funds in respect of any matter for which the Group has \naccrued loss contingency provisions cannot be determined with \ncertainty based on currently available information, and accordingly \nmay ultimately prove to be substantially greater (or may be less) \nthan the provision that is reflected on the Group\xe2\x80\x99s balance sheet.\n\nIt is inherently difficult to determine whether a loss is probable or \neven reasonably possible or to estimate the amount of any loss or \nloss range for many of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s legal proceedings. Estimates, \nby their nature, are based on judgment and currently available infor-\nmation and involve a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, \nthe type and nature of the proceeding, the progress of the matter, \nthe advice of counsel, the Group\xe2\x80\x99s defenses and its experience in \nsimilar matters, as well as its assessment of matters, including set-\ntlements, involving other defendants in similar or related cases or \nproceedings. Factual and legal determinations, many of which are \ncomplex, must be made before a loss, additional losses or ranges \nof loss can be reasonably estimated for any proceeding.\n\nMost matters pending against the Group seek damages of an \nindeterminate amount. While certain matters specify the damages \nclaimed, such claimed amount may not represent the Group\xe2\x80\x99s \nreasonably possible losses. For certain of the proceedings dis-\ncussed below the Group has disclosed the amount of damages \nclaimed and certain other quantifiable information that is publicly \navailable.\n\nThe following table presents a roll forward of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s aggre-\ngate litigation provisions.\n\nLitigation provisions\n\xc2\xa0 \n\n \n\nCHF million\xc2\xa0 \nBalance at beginning of period\xc2\xa0 \nIncrease in litigation accruals\xc2\xa0 \nDecrease in litigation accruals\xc2\xa0 \nDecrease for settlements and other cash payments\xc2\xa0 \nForeign exchange translation\xc2\xa0 \nBalance at end of period\xc2\xa0 \n\n2018 \n\n749 \n503 \n(91) \n(481) \n1 \n681 \n\nThe Group\xe2\x80\x99s aggregate litigation provisions include estimates of \nlosses, additional losses or ranges of loss for proceedings for which \nsuch losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. The \nGroup does not believe that it can estimate an aggregate range of \nreasonably possible losses for certain of its proceedings because \nof their complexity, the novelty of some of the claims, the early \n\n390\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\nstage of the proceedings, the limited amount of discovery that has \noccurred and/or other factors. The Group\xe2\x80\x99s estimate of the aggre-\ngate range of reasonably possible losses that are not covered by \nexisting provisions for the proceedings discussed below for which \nthe Group believes an estimate is possible is zero to CHF\xc2\xa01.4 \nbillion.\n\nAfter taking into account its litigation provisions, the Group believes, \nbased on currently available information and advice of counsel, that \nthe results of its legal proceedings, in the aggregate, will not have a \nmaterial adverse effect on the Group\xe2\x80\x99s financial condition. However, \nin light of the inherent uncertainties of such proceedings, includ-\ning those brought by regulators or other governmental authorities, \nthe ultimate cost to the Group of resolving such proceedings may \nexceed current litigation provisions and any excess may be material \nto its operating results for any particular period, depending, in part, \nupon the operating results for such period.\n\nEnron-related litigation\n\nCredit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (CSS LLC) and certain \nof its affiliates, together with Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., \nDeutsche Bank AG, and Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc., were named \nas defendants in an Enron-related action, Silvercreek Manage-\nment Inc. v. Citigroup, Inc., et al., in the US District Court for the \nSouthern District of New York (SDNY). In this action, plaintiffs \nasserted they relied on Enron\xe2\x80\x99s financial statements, and sought \nto hold the defendants responsible for any inaccuracies in Enron\xe2\x80\x99s \nfinancial statements. The plaintiffs sought to assert federal and \nstate law claims relating to its alleged USD\xc2\xa0280 million in losses \nrelating to its Enron investments. On November 10, 2017, the \ndefendants filed motions for summary judgment. On Septem-\nber 28, 2018, the SDNY granted in part and denied in part the \ndefendants\xe2\x80\x99 motions for summary judgment, dismissing certain \nclaims. On December 28, 2018, CSS LLC and its affiliates, \ntogether with Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, \nand Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc. executed an agreement with the \nplaintiffs to settle this litigation. On January 10, 2019, the SDNY \nentered an order of final judgment dismissing with prejudice all \nclaims against those defendants. This ends the last of CSS LLC \nand its affiliates\xe2\x80\x99 Enron-related litigation.\n\nMortgage-related matters\n\nGovernment and regulatory related matters\nVarious financial institutions, including CSS LLC and certain of \nits affiliates, have received requests for information from, and/\nor have been defending civil actions by, certain regulators and/\nor government entities, including the US Department of Justice \n(DOJ) and other members of the Residential Mortgage-Backed \nSecurities (RMBS) Working Group of the US Financial Fraud \nEnforcement Task Force, regarding the origination, purchase, \nsecuritization, servicing and trading of subprime and non-sub-\nprime residential and commercial mortgages and related issues. \nCSS LLC and its affiliates are cooperating with such requests for \ninformation.\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nDOJ RMBS settlement\nAs previously disclosed, on January 18, 2017, CSS LLC and its \ncurrent and former US subsidiaries and US affiliates reached a \nsettlement with the DOJ related to its legacy RMBS business, \na business conducted through 2007. The settlement resolved \npotential civil claims by the DOJ related to certain of those Credit \nSuisse entities\xe2\x80\x99 packaging, marketing, structuring, arrangement, \nunderwriting, issuance and sale of RMBS. Pursuant to the terms \nof the settlement a civil monetary penalty was paid to the DOJ in \nJanuary 2017. The settlement also required the above-mentioned \nentities to provide a specified amount of consumer relief mea-\nsures, including affordable housing payments and loan forgive-\nness, within five years of the settlement, and the DOJ and Credit \nSuisse agreed to the appointment of an independent monitor to \noversee the completion of the consumer relief requirements of \nthe settlement. The monitor has published reports on October \n27, 2017, February 20, 2018 and August 31, 2018 noting Credit \nSuisse\xe2\x80\x99s cooperation and progress toward satisfaction of the con-\nsumer relief requirements. \n\nNYAG and NJAG litigation\nFollowing an investigation, on November 20, 2012, the New York \nAttorney General (NYAG), on behalf of the State of New York, \nfiled a civil action in the Supreme Court for the State of New York, \nNew York County (SCNY) against CSS LLC and affiliated entities \nin their roles as issuer, sponsor, depositor and/or underwriter of \nRMBS transactions prior to 2008. The complaint, which referenced \n64 RMBS issued, sponsored, deposited and underwritten by CSS \nLLC and its affiliates in 2006 and 2007, alleged that CSS LLC and \nits affiliates misled investors regarding the due diligence and qual-\nity control performed on the mortgage loans underlying the RMBS \nat issue, and sought an unspecified amount of damages. On June \n12, 2018, the New York State Court of Appeals ordered the partial \ndismissal of the NYAG\xe2\x80\x99s complaint, holding that the NYAG\xe2\x80\x99s claim \npursuant to New York\xe2\x80\x99s Martin Act was time-barred and remand-\ning the action to the SCNY for further proceedings on the NYAG\xe2\x80\x99s \nclaim pursuant to New York\xe2\x80\x99s Executive Law. On December 31, \n2018, pursuant to a settlement that resolved all claims by the NYAG \nagainst CSS LLC and its affiliates, the NYAG filed with the SCNY \na stipulation dismissing its action with prejudice. The settlement \nrequired the Credit Suisse defendants to pay USD 10 million to the \nState of New York. This ends the action with the NYAG against \nCSS LLC and its affiliates. On December 18, 2013, the New Jer-\nsey Attorney General (NJAG), on behalf of the State of New Jersey, \nfiled a civil action in the Superior Court of New Jersey, Chancery \nDivision, Mercer County (SCNJ), against CSS LLC and affiliated \nentities in their roles as issuer, sponsor, depositor and/or underwriter \nof RMBS transactions prior to 2008. The original complaint, which \nreferenced 13 RMBS issued, sponsored, deposited and underwrit-\nten by CSS LLC and its affiliates in 2006 and 2007, alleges that \nCSS LLC and its affiliates misled investors and engaged in fraud or \ndeceit in connection with the offer and sale of RMBS, and seeks an \nunspecified amount of damages. On August 21, 2014, the SCNJ \ndismissed without prejudice the action brought against CSS LLC \nand its affiliates by the NJAG. On September 4, 2014, the NJAG \nfiled an amended complaint against CSS LLC and its affiliates, \nasserting additional allegations but not expanding the number of \n\nclaims or RMBS referenced in the original complaint. The NJAG \naction is at an intermediate procedural stage.\n\nCivil litigation\nCSS LLC and/or certain of its affiliates have also been named \nas defendants in various civil litigation matters related to their \nroles as issuer, sponsor, depositor, underwriter and/or servicer of \nRMBS transactions. These cases include or have included class \naction lawsuits, actions by individual investors in RMBS, actions \nby monoline insurance companies that guaranteed payments of \nprincipal and interest for certain RMBS, and repurchase actions \nby RMBS trusts, trustees and/or investors. Although the allega-\ntions vary by lawsuit, plaintiffs in the class actions and individual \ninvestor actions have generally alleged that the offering docu-\nments of securities issued by various RMBS securitization trusts \ncontained material misrepresentations and omissions, includ-\ning statements regarding the underwriting standards pursuant \nto which the underlying mortgage loans were issued; monoline \ninsurers allege that loans that collateralize RMBS they insured \nbreached representations and warranties made with respect to \nthe loans at the time of securitization and that they were fraudu-\nlently induced to enter into the transactions; and repurchase \naction plaintiffs generally allege breached representations and \nwarranties in respect of mortgage loans and failure to repurchase \nsuch mortgage loans as required under the applicable agree-\nments. The amounts disclosed below do not reflect actual realized \nplaintiff losses to date or anticipated future litigation exposure. \nRather, unless otherwise stated, these amounts reflect the origi-\nnal unpaid principal balance amounts as alleged in these actions \nand do not include any reduction in principal amounts since issu-\nance. Further, unless otherwise stated, amounts attributable to \nan \xe2\x80\x9coperative pleading\xe2\x80\x9d for the individual investor actions are not \naltered for settlements, dismissals or other occurrences, if any, \nthat may have caused the amounts to change subsequent to the \noperative pleading. In addition to the mortgage-related actions \ndiscussed below, a number of other entities have threatened to \nassert claims against CSS LLC and/or its affiliates in connection \nwith various RMBS issuances.\n\nIndividual investor actions\nCSS LLC and, in some instances, its affiliates, as an RMBS issuer, \nunderwriter and/or other participant, along with other defendants, \nhave been named as defendants in: (i) one action brought by the \nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), as receiver for Citi-\nzens National Bank and Strategic Capital Bank, in the SDNY, in \nwhich claims against CSS LLC and its affiliates relate to approxi-\nmately USD\xc2\xa028 million of the RMBS at issue (approximately 20% \nof the USD\xc2\xa0141 million at issue against all defendants in the opera-\ntive pleading); (ii) two actions brought by the FDIC, as receiver for \nColonial Bank: one action in the SDNY, in which claims against \nCSS LLC relate to approximately USD\xc2\xa092 million of the RMBS at \nissue (approximately 23% of the USD\xc2\xa0394 million at issue against \nall defendants in the operative pleading); and one action in the Cir-\ncuit Court of Montgomery County, Alabama, in which claims against \nCSS LLC and its affiliates relate to approximately USD\xc2\xa0139 million \nof the RMBS at issue (approximately 45% of the USD\xc2\xa0311 million at \nissue against all defendants in the operative pleading), reduced from \n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n391\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\napproximately USD\xc2\xa0153 million following the February 14, 2017 \ndismissal with prejudice of claims pertaining to one RMBS offering \non which CSS LLC and its affiliates were sued, and which has a \ntrial scheduled to begin in April 2019; (iii) one action brought by the \nFederal Home Loan Bank of Seattle (FHLB Seattle) in Washing-\nton state court, in which claims against CSS LLC and its affili-\nates currently on appeal relate to approximately USD\xc2\xa0145 million of \nthe RMBS at issue, reduced from approximately USD\xc2\xa0249 million \nof RMBS at issue; these claims were dismissed with prejudice in \nthe trial court\xe2\x80\x99s May 4, 2016 summary judgment order; on May 3, \n2018, the Washington State Supreme Court granted FHLB Seat-\ntle\xe2\x80\x99s petition for review of the Washington State Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 \ndecision affirming the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal of FHLB Seattle\xe2\x80\x99s \nclaims; and (iv) one action brought by the Federal Home Loan Bank \nof Boston in Massachusetts state court, in which claims against \nCSS LLC and its affiliates relate to approximately USD\xc2\xa0333 million \nof the RMBS at issue, reduced from USD\xc2\xa0373 million (approxi-\nmately 6% of the USD\xc2\xa05.7 billion at issue against all defendants in \nthe operative pleading) following the October 27, 2015 stipulation \nof voluntary dismissal with prejudice of claims pertaining to a cer-\ntain RMBS offering on which CSS LLC and its affiliates were sued. \nThese actions are at various procedural stages.\n\nCSS LLC and certain of its affiliates are the only defendants \nnamed in an action brought by IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG \nand affiliated entities in the SCNY, in which claims against CSS \nLLC and its affiliates relate to approximately USD\xc2\xa097 million of \nRMBS at issue; this action is at an intermediate procedural stage. \nCSS LLC and an affiliate were defendants in an action brought \nby Royal Park Investments SA/NV (Royal Park) in the SCNY, in \nwhich claims against CSS LLC and its affiliate related to approxi-\nmately USD\xc2\xa0360 million of RMBS at issue; on October 9, 2018, \nthe Appellate Division First Department of the SCNY (First Depart-\nment) affirmed the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal with prejudice of all claims \nagainst CSS LLC and its affiliate and, on January 15, 2019, the \nNew York State Court of Appeals denied Royal Park\xe2\x80\x99s request to \nfurther appeal.\n\nAs disclosed in Credit Suisse\xe2\x80\x99s quarterly Financial Reports for \n2018, individual investor actions discontinued during the course of \n2018 included the following: (i) on July 19, 2018, following a set-\ntlement, the Tennessee state court presiding in the action brought \nby the Tennessee Consolidated Retirement System dismissed \nwith prejudice all claims against CSS LLC relating to approxi-\nmately USD\xc2\xa024 million of RMBS at issue; and (ii) on July 27, \n2018, following a settlement, the SCNY presiding in the action \nbrought by Phoenix Light SF Ltd. and affiliated entities dismissed \nwith prejudice all claims against CSS LLC and its affiliates related \nto approximately USD\xc2\xa0281 million of RMBS at issue.\n\nMonoline insurer disputes\nCSS LLC and certain of its affiliates are defendants in one mono-\nline insurer action pending in the SCNY, commenced by MBIA \nInsurance Corp. (MBIA) as guarantor for payments of principal \nand interest related to approximately USD\xc2\xa0770 million of RMBS \nissued in an offering sponsored by the Credit Suisse defendants. \nOne theory of liability advanced by MBIA is that an affiliate of \n\n392\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\nCSS LLC must repurchase certain mortgage loans from the \ntrusts at issue. MBIA claims that the vast majority of the underly-\ning mortgage loans breach certain representations and warran-\nties, and that the affiliate has failed to repurchase the allegedly \ndefective loans. In addition, MBIA brought claims for fraudulent \ninducement, material misrepresentations, breaches of warran-\nties, repurchase obligations, and reimbursement. MBIA submit-\nted repurchase demands for loans with an original principal bal-\nance of approximately USD\xc2\xa0549 million. On March 31, 2017, the \nSCNY granted in part and denied in part both parties\xe2\x80\x99 respec-\ntive summary judgment motions, which resulted, among other \nthings, in the dismissal of MBIA\xe2\x80\x99s fraudulent inducement claim \nwith prejudice. On September 13, 2018, the First Department \nissued a decision that, among other things, affirmed the dismissal \nof MBIA\xe2\x80\x99s fraudulent inducement claim with prejudice. The First \nDepartment also ruled in favor of CSS LLC and certain of its affil-\niates on their cross-appeal, reversing the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s interpreta-\ntion of certain representations and warranties and ruling that their \nmeaning should be decided at trial. Following its decision, the \nFirst Department remanded the action to the trial court for further \nproceedings. Trial in this action is scheduled to begin in July 2019.\n\nRepurchase litigations\nDLJ Mortgage Capital, Inc. (DLJ) is a defendant in: (i) one action \nbrought by Asset Backed Securities Corporation Home Equity \nLoan Trust, Series 2006-HE7, in which plaintiff alleges dam-\nages of not less than USD\xc2\xa0341 million, which will proceed in the \nSCNY following the resolution of a previously pending appeal; (ii) \none action brought by Home Equity Asset Trust, Series 2006-8, \nin which plaintiff alleges damages of not less than USD\xc2\xa0436 mil-\nlion; (iii) one action brought by Home Equity Asset Trust 2007-1, in \nwhich plaintiff alleges damages of not less than USD\xc2\xa0420 million; \n(iv) one action brought by Home Equity Asset Trust Series 2007-3, \nin which plaintiff alleges damages of not less than USD\xc2\xa0206 mil-\nlion, which was dismissed without prejudice by order of the SCNY \non December 21, 2015 with leave to restore within one year and \nwhich plaintiff moved to restore on December 20, 2016, which the \ncourt granted on March 15, 2017 by restoring the case to active \nstatus; (v) one action brought by Home Equity Asset Trust 2007-\n2, in which plaintiff alleges damages of not less than USD\xc2\xa0495 \nmillion; and (vi) one action brought by CSMC Asset-Backed Trust \n2007-NC1, in which no damages amount is alleged. DLJ and its \naffiliate, Select Portfolio Servicing, Inc. (SPS), are defendants in: \none action brought by Home Equity Mortgage Trust Series 2006-\n1, Home Equity Mortgage Trust Series 2006-3 and Home Equity \nMortgage Trust Series 2006-4, in which plaintiffs allege damages \nof not less than USD\xc2\xa0730 million, and allege that SPS obstructed \nthe investigation into the full extent of the defects in the mortgage \npools by refusing to afford the trustee reasonable access to certain \norigination files; and one action brought by Home Equity Mortgage \nTrust Series 2006-5, in which plaintiff alleges damages of not less \nthan USD\xc2\xa0500 million, and alleges that SPS likely discovered DLJ\xe2\x80\x99s \nalleged breaches of representations and warranties but did not \nnotify the trustee of such breaches, in alleged violation of its con-\ntractual obligations. These actions are brought in the SCNY and are \nat various procedural stages.\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nAs disclosed in Credit Suisse\xe2\x80\x99s fourth quarter Financial Report of \n2013, the following repurchase actions were dismissed with prej-\nudice in 2013: the three consolidated actions brought by Home \nEquity Asset Trust 2006-5, Home Equity Asset Trust 2006-6 \nand Home Equity Asset Trust 2006-7 against DLJ. Those dis-\nmissals were upheld by the New York State Court of Appeals on \nFebruary 19, 2019. Separately, a notice of appeal has been filed \nbefore the First Department in these consolidated actions from \nthe SCNY\xe2\x80\x99s April 2017 denial of plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 request that its 2013 \ndismissal decision be modified to allow plaintiffs to assert new \nclaims not previously included in plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 consolidated complaint. \n\nBank loan litigation\n\nOn January 3, 2010, Credit Suisse AG and certain of its affili-\nates were named as defendants in a lawsuit filed in the US District \nCourt for the District of Idaho by current or former homeowners in \nfour real estate developments, Tamarack Resort, Yellowstone Club, \nLake Las Vegas and Ginn Sur Mer. Credit Suisse defendants in \nthis matter arranged, and acted as the agent bank for, syndicated \nloans provided to borrowers affiliated with all four developments, \nand who have been or are now in bankruptcy or foreclosure. Plain-\ntiffs generally allege that Credit Suisse defendants committed fraud \nby using an unaccepted appraisal method to overvalue the proper-\nties with the intention of having the borrowers take out loans they \ncould not repay because it would allow Credit Suisse defendants to \nlater push the borrowers into bankruptcy and take ownership of the \nproperties. Plaintiffs demanded USD\xc2\xa024 billion in damages. Cush-\nman & Wakefield, the appraiser for the properties at issue, was \nalso named as a defendant. After the filing of amended complaints \nand motions to dismiss, the claims were significantly reduced. On \nSeptember 24, 2013, the court denied the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 motion for \nclass certification so the case could not proceed as a class action. \nOn February 5, 2015, the court granted plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 motion for leave \nto file an amended complaint, adding additional individual plaintiffs. \nOn April 13, 2015, the court granted plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 motion for leave \nto add a claim for punitive damages. On November 20, 2015, the \nplaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment, which the defen-\ndants opposed on December 14, 2015. On December 18, 2015, \nthe defendants filed motions for summary judgment. On July 27, \n2016, the US District Court for the District of Idaho granted the \ndefendants\xe2\x80\x99 motions for summary judgment, dismissing the case \nwith prejudice. On April 26, 2018, the United States Court of \nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the granting of summary \njudgment for Credit Suisse AG and certain of its affiliates.\n\nCSS LLC and certain of its affiliates are the subject of certain \nother related litigation regarding certain of these loans as well as \nother similar real estate developments. Such litigation includes \ntwo cases brought in Texas and New York state courts by enti-\nties related to Highland Capital Management LP (Highland). In \nthe case in Texas state court, a jury trial was held in December \n2014 on Highland\xe2\x80\x99s claim for fraudulent inducement by affirma-\ntive misrepresentation and omission. A verdict was issued for the \nplaintiff on its claim for fraudulent inducement by affirmative mis-\nrepresentation, but the jury rejected its claim that CSS LLC and \n\nan affiliate had committed fraudulent inducement by omission. \nThe Texas judge held a bench trial on Highland\xe2\x80\x99s remaining claims \nin May and June 2015, and entered judgment in the amount of \nUSD\xc2\xa0287 million (including prejudgment interest) for the plaintiff \non September 4, 2015. Both parties appealed and on February \n21, 2018 the appeals court affirmed the lower court\xe2\x80\x99s decision. On \nMarch 7, 2018, the defendants filed a motion for rehearing with the \nappeals court. On April 2, 2018, the motion for rehearing with the \nappeals court was denied. On July 18, 2018, the defendants filed \na request for review by the Texas Supreme Court. On December \n14, 2018, the court issued an order requiring briefs on the merits \nin the request for review. In the case in New York state court, the \ncourt granted in part and denied in part CSS LLC and certain of \nits affiliates\xe2\x80\x99 summary judgment motion. Both parties appealed that \ndecision, but the appellate court affirmed the decision in full. CSS \nLLC and certain of its affiliates separately sued Highland-man-\naged funds on related trades and received a favorable judgment \nawarding both principal owed and prejudgment interest. Highland \nappealed the portion of the judgment awarding prejudgment inter-\nest, however the original decision was affirmed in its entirety. The \nparties subsequently agreed to settle the amount owed by the \nHighland-managed funds under the judgment.\n\nTax and securities law matters\n\nOn May 19, 2014, Credit Suisse AG entered into settlement \nagreements with several US regulators regarding its US cross-\nborder matters. As part of the agreements, Credit Suisse AG, \namong other things, engaged an independent corporate monitor \nthat reports to the New York State Department of Financial Ser-\nvices. As of July 31, 2018, the monitor has concluded both his \nreview and his assignment. \n\nRates-related matters\n\nRegulatory matters\nRegulatory authorities in a number of jurisdictions, including the \nUS, UK, EU and Switzerland, have for an extended period of \ntime been conducting investigations into the setting of LIBOR \nand other reference rates with respect to a number of curren-\ncies, as well as the pricing of certain related derivatives. These \nongoing investigations have included information requests from \nregulators regarding LIBOR-setting practices and reviews of the \nactivities of various financial institutions, including Credit Suisse \nGroup AG, which is a member of three LIBOR rate-setting panels \n(US Dollar LIBOR, Swiss Franc LIBOR and Euro LIBOR). Credit \nSuisse is cooperating fully with these investigations. In particu-\nlar, it has been reported that regulators are investigating whether \nfinancial institutions engaged in an effort to manipulate LIBOR, \neither individually or in concert with other institutions, in order to \nimprove market perception of these institutions\xe2\x80\x99 financial health \nand/or to increase the value of their proprietary trading positions. \nIn response to regulatory inquiries, Credit Suisse commissioned \na review of these issues. To date, Credit Suisse has seen no evi-\ndence to suggest that it is likely to have any material exposure in \nconnection with these issues.\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n393\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nRegulatory authorities in a number of jurisdictions, including the \nSwiss Competition Commission (COMCO), the European Com-\nmission (Commission), the South African Competition Commis-\nsion, and the Brazilian Competition Authority have been conduct-\ning investigations into the trading activities, information sharing \nand the setting of benchmark rates in the foreign exchange \n(including electronic trading) markets. \n\nOn March 31, 2014, COMCO announced its formal investigation \nof numerous Swiss and international financial institutions, includ-\ning Credit Suisse Group AG, in relation to the setting of exchange \nrates in foreign exchange trading. Credit Suisse continues to \ncooperate with this ongoing investigation.\n\nOn July 26, 2018, Credit Suisse Group AG and certain affili-\nates received a Statement of Objections from the Commission, \nalleging that Credit Suisse entities engaged in anticompetitive \npractices in connection with their foreign exchange trading busi-\nness. The Statement of Objections sets out the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s \npreliminary views and does not prejudge the final outcome of its \ninvestigation.\n\nThe reference rates investigations have also included information \nrequests from regulators concerning supranational, sub-sovereign \nand agency (SSA) bonds and commodities (including precious \nmetals) markets. Credit Suisse is cooperating fully with these \ninvestigations. \n\nOn December 20, 2018, Credit Suisse Group AG and Credit \nSuisse (Securities) Europe Limited received a Statement of \nObjections from the Commission, alleging that Credit Suisse enti-\nties engaged in anticompetitive practices in connection with its \nsupranational, sub-sovereign, and agency (SSA) bonds trading \nbusiness.\xc2\xa0The Statement of Objections sets out the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s \npreliminary views and does not prejudge the final outcome of its \ninvestigation.\n\nThe investigations are ongoing and it is too soon to predict the \nfinal outcome of the investigations.\n\nCivil litigation\nUSD LIBOR litigation\nBeginning in 2011, certain Credit Suisse entities were named \nin various civil lawsuits filed in the US, alleging banks on the \nUS dollar LIBOR panel manipulated US dollar LIBOR to benefit \ntheir reputation and increase profits. All but one of these matters \nhave been consolidated for pre-trial purposes into a multi-district \nlitigation in the SDNY. The majority of the actions have been \nstayed since their outset, while a handful of individual actions and \nputative class actions have been proceeding. The Credit Suisse \nentities have been dismissed from all non-stayed putative class \nactions.\n\nIn a series of rulings between 2013 and 2018 on motions to \ndismiss, the SDNY (i) narrowed the claims against the Credit \nSuisse entities and the other defendants (dismissing antitrust, \nRacketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), \n\n394\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\nCommodity Exchange Act, and state law claims), (ii) narrowed the \nset of plaintiffs who may bring claims, and (iii) narrowed the set of \ndefendants in the LIBOR actions (including the dismissal of sev-\neral Credit Suisse entities from various cases on personal jurisdic-\ntion grounds). The plaintiffs have appealed several of the SDNY\xe2\x80\x99s \nrulings to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second \nCircuit (Second Circuit). On February 23, 2018, the Second Cir-\ncuit issued a decision in an appeal of one individual (non-class) \naction that largely affirmed the SDNY\xe2\x80\x99s rulings, including uphold-\ning the dismissal of certain state law and securities law claims \nas to Credit Suisse Group AG, but vacated certain rulings and \nremanded the case for further proceedings. Another consolidated \nSecond Circuit appeal is still pending. \n\nSeparately, on May 4, 2017, the plaintiffs in the three non-stayed \nputative class actions moved for class certification. On February \n28, 2018, the SDNY denied certification in two of the actions \nand granted certification over a single antitrust claim in an action \nbrought by over-the-counter purchasers of LIBOR-linked deriva-\ntives. In the same decision, the court dismissed Credit Suisse \nAG, the only remaining Credit Suisse entity in the action, from the \nover-the-counter action. All parties moved for immediate appellate \nreview of the class-certification decisions, and the Second Circuit \ndenied their petitions for review.\n\nOn June 15, 2018, plaintiffs in several non-class actions filed \namended complaints or filed for leave to amend their currently \noperative complaints. On July 13, 2018, defendants moved to \ndismiss the amended complaints and opposed leave to amend. \n\nIn the one matter that is not consolidated in the multi-district \nlitigation, the SDNY granted the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 motion to dismiss \non March 31, 2015. On June 1, 2015, plaintiff filed a motion for \nleave to file a second amended complaint in the SDNY; defen-\ndants\xe2\x80\x99 opposition brief was filed on July 15, 2015. On March 20, \n2018, the SDNY denied the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s request for leave to file an \namended pleading and dismissed the case on the merits. Plaintiff \nappealed to the Second Circuit. \n\nUSD ICE LIBOR litigation\nIn January 2019, members of the US dollar Intercontinental \nExchange (ICE) LIBOR panel, including Credit Suisse Group AG \nand certain of its affiliates, were named in three civil putative \nclass action lawsuits alleging that panel banks suppressed US \ndollar ICE LIBOR to benefit defendants\xe2\x80\x99 trading positions. These \nactions have been consolidated in the SDNY.\n\nCHF LIBOR litigation\nIn February 2015, various banks that served on the Swiss franc \nLIBOR panel, including Credit Suisse Group AG, were named \nin a civil putative class action lawsuit filed in the SDNY, alleging \nmanipulation of Swiss franc LIBOR to benefit defendants\xe2\x80\x99 trading \npositions. On September 25, 2017, the SDNY granted defen-\ndants\xe2\x80\x99 motion to dismiss all claims, but permitted the plaintiffs to \nfile an amended complaint. Defendants filed motions to dismiss \nthe amended complaint on February 7, 2018.\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nSIBOR/SOR litigation\nIn July 2016, various banks that served on the Singapore Interbank \nOffered Rate (SIBOR) and Singapore Swap Offer Rate (SOR) \npanels, including Credit Suisse Group AG and affiliates, were \nnamed in a civil putative class action lawsuit filed in the SDNY, \nalleging manipulation of SIBOR and SOR to benefit defendants\xe2\x80\x99 \ntrading positions. On August 18, 2017, the SDNY dismissed all \nclaims against Credit Suisse Group AG and affiliates (and various \nother defendants) but granted the plaintiffs leave to amend their \ncomplaint. On October 4, 2018, the SDNY granted in part and \ndenied in part defendants\xe2\x80\x99 motion to dismiss plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 second \namended complaint, upholding antitrust claims against Credit \nSuisse AG and other panel bank defendants, but narrowing the \nclaims to those related to Singapore Dollar SIBOR and dismissing \nall but one plaintiff from the action. The court also dismissed the \nRICO claims without leave to amend. On October 25, 2018, the \nremaining plaintiff filed a third amended complaint. The remaining \ndefendants moved to dismiss on November 15, 2018.\n\nForeign exchange litigation\nCredit Suisse Group AG and affiliates as well as other financial insti-\ntutions are named in five pending civil lawsuits in the SDNY relating \nto the alleged manipulation of foreign exchange rates. \n\nThe first pending matter is a putative consolidated class action. \nOn January 28, 2015, the court denied defendants\xe2\x80\x99 motion to \ndismiss the original consolidated complaint brought by US-based \ninvestors and foreign plaintiffs who transacted in the US, but \ngranted their motion to dismiss the claims of foreign-based inves-\ntors for transactions outside of the US. In July 2015, plaintiffs \nfiled a second consolidated amended complaint, adding additional \ndefendants and asserting additional claims on behalf of a second \nputative class of exchange investors. On September 20, 2016, \nthe SDNY granted in part and denied in part a motion to dismiss \nfiled by the Group and affiliates, along with other financial institu-\ntions, which reduced the size of the putative class, but allowed \nthe primary antitrust and Commodity Exchange Act claims to \nsurvive.

On August 23, 2016, the SDNY \ngranted a motion to dismiss filed by affiliates of Credit Suisse \nAG, along with other financial institutions. Plaintiffs appealed that \ndecision, and on July 10, 2018, the Second Circuit issued an \norder affirming in full the SDNY\xe2\x80\x99s decision to dismiss the putative \nERISA class action against Credit Suisse AG and affiliates as well \nas other defendant financial institutions and denying plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 \nrequest for leave to amend their complaint. \n\nThe third pending matter names Credit Suisse Group AG and \naffiliates, as well as other financial institutions, in a consolidated \n\nputative class action filed in the SDNY, alleging manipulation of \nthe foreign exchange market on behalf of indirect purchasers of \nforeign exchange instruments. On March 15, 2018, the court \nissued a decision granting defendants\xe2\x80\x99 joint motion to dismiss and \ndismissing the consolidated complaint in its entirety. On October \n25, 2018, the SDNY granted in substantial part plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 motion \nfor leave to file a proposed second consolidated class action com-\nplaint, which plaintiffs filed on November 28, 2018.

Credit Suisse AG filed a criminal complaint against the \nformer relationship manager with the Geneva Prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s Office \nupon which the prosecutor initiated a criminal investigation. Sev-\neral clients of the former relationship manager also filed criminal \ncomplaints with the Geneva Prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s Office.

Several parties have appealed \nthe judgement. Civil lawsuits were initiated on August 25, 2017 in \nthe High Court of Singapore, the High Court of New Zealand and \nthe Supreme Court of Bermuda against Credit Suisse AG and \ncertain affiliates, based on the findings established in the criminal \nproceedings against the former relationship manager.\xc2\xa0On July 17, \n2018, the High Court of New Zealand dismissed the civil lawsuit \nbrought against Credit Suisse AG and stayed the same lawsuit \nagainst a New Zealand incorporated affiliate.\xc2\xa0On August 31, \n2018, the civil lawsuit was stayed by an Assistant Registrar of the \nHigh Court of Singapore.\xc2\xa0Plaintiffs in both the New Zealand and \nSingapore civil proceedings have appealed these decisions. On \nJanuary 18, 2019 the Singapore High Court dismissed the plain-\ntiffs\xe2\x80\x99 appeal and upheld the Assistant Registrar\xe2\x80\x99s decision to stay \nthe civil proceedings in Singapore; the plaintiffs have appealed \nthis decision.\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n397\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nFIFA-related matters\n\nIn connection with investigations by US and Swiss government \nauthorities into the involvement of financial institutions in the \nalleged bribery and corruption surrounding the F\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9ration Inter-\nnationale de Football Association (FIFA), Credit Suisse received \ninquiries from these authorities regarding its banking relationships \nwith certain individuals and entities associated with FIFA, includ-\ning but not limited to certain persons and entities named and/\nor described in the May 20, 2015 indictment and the November \n25, 2015 superseding indictment filed by the Eastern District of \nNew York US Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office. The US and Swiss investiga-\ntions encompassed whether multiple financial institutions, includ-\ning Credit Suisse, permitted the processing of suspicious or \notherwise improper transactions, or failed to observe anti-money \nlaundering laws and regulations, with respect to the accounts of \ncertain persons and entities associated with FIFA. Credit Suisse \ncontinues to cooperate with US authorities on this matter. As pre-\nviously disclosed, the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Author-\nity FINMA has announced the conclusion of its investigation.\n\nExternal asset manager matter\n\nSeveral clients have claimed that an external asset manager \nbased in Geneva misappropriated funds, forged bank statements, \ntransferred assets between client accounts at Credit Suisse AG \nas custodian to conceal losses and made investments without the \nauthorization of those clients. Credit Suisse AG is investigating \nthe claims. The Geneva Prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s Office initiated a criminal \ninvestigation against representatives of the external asset man-\nager and two former Credit Suisse AG employees. This investiga-\ntion was expanded in November 2018 to also include one former \nand one current Credit Suisse AG employee and Credit Suisse \nAG itself in order to assess the sufficiency of Credit Suisse AG\xe2\x80\x99s \ncontrols and supervision. Credit Suisse AG, in March 2019, \nreached a tentative settlement with the affected clients.\n\nMossack Fonseca/Israel Desk matters\n\nCredit Suisse, along with many financial institutions, has received \ninquiries from governmental and regulatory authorities concern-\ning banking relationships between financial institutions, their \nclients and the Panama-based law firm of Mossack Fonseca. \nCredit Suisse has also received governmental and regulatory \ninquiries concerning cross-border services provided by Credit \nSuisse\xe2\x80\x99s Switzerland-based Israel Desk. Credit Suisse is conduct-\ning a review of these issues and has been cooperating with the \nauthorities.\n\nMozambique matter\n\nCredit Suisse is responding to requests from regulatory and \nenforcement authorities related to certain Credit Suisse entities\xe2\x80\x99 \narrangement of loan financing to Mozambique state enterprises, \nProindicus S.A. and Empresa Mocambiacana de Atum S.A. \n(EMATUM), a distribution to private investors of loan participa-\ntion notes (LPN) related to the EMATUM financing in September \n\n398\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n2013, and certain Credit Suisse entities\xe2\x80\x99 subsequent role in \narranging the exchange of those LPNs for Eurobonds issued by \nthe Republic of Mozambique. On January 3, 2019, the United \nStates Attorney for the Eastern District of New York unsealed an \nindictment against several individuals in connection with the mat-\nter, including three former Credit Suisse employees. Credit Suisse \nis cooperating with the authorities on this matter. On February \n27, 2019, certain Credit Suisse entities, the same three former \nemployees, and several other unrelated entities were sued in the \nEnglish High Court by the Republic of Mozambique. Credit Suisse \nhas not yet been served. Credit Suisse is aware of statements \nmade by the Attorney General of Mozambique and notes that it \nhad no involvement in the transaction with Mozambique Asset \nManagement S.A.\n\nCross-border private banking matters \n\nCredit Suisse offices in various locations, including the UK, the \nNetherlands and France, have been contacted by regulatory and \nlaw enforcement authorities that are seeking records and infor-\nmation concerning investigations into our historical private bank-\ning services on a cross-border basis and in part through our local \nbranches and banks. Credit Suisse has conducted a review of \nthese issues and is cooperating with the authorities. Credit Suisse \napplies a strict zero tolerance policy on tax evasion. \n\nHiring practices investigation\n\nOn May 30, 2018, Credit Suisse (Hong Kong) Limited (CSHKL) \nentered into a non-prosecution agreement to resolve the inves-\ntigation of past hiring practices between 2007 and 2013 in the \nAsia Pacific region by the US Department of Justice (DOJ), \nunder which CSHKL paid a penalty of USD\xc2\xa047 million. No crimi-\nnal charges were filed and no monitor was required. As part of \nthe agreement, Credit Suisse AG will continue to cooperate with \nthe DOJ, will maintain prescribed standards in its compliance \nprograms and will report to the DOJ on the functioning of its \nenhanced compliance programs. On July 5, 2018, Credit Suisse \nGroup AG reached a settlement with the US Securities and \nExchange Commission to resolve the parallel investigation of the \nsame conduct for USD\xc2\xa029.8 million. \n\nWrite-downs litigation\n\nOn December 22, 2017, Credit Suisse Group AG and certain cur-\nrent and former executives were named in a class action complaint \nfiled in the SDNY on behalf of a putative class of purchasers of \nCredit Suisse Group AG American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), \nasserting claims for violations of Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the \nUS Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereun-\nder, alleging that defendants sanctioned increases to trading limits \nthat ultimately led to write-downs in the fourth quarter of 2015 \nand the first quarter of 2016 and a decline in the market value of \nthe ADRs.

Group\xe2\x80\x99s consolidated financial statements have been pre-\npared in accordance with US GAAP.\n\nFINMA requires Swiss-domiciled banks which present their finan-\ncial statements under either US GAAP or International Financial \nReporting Standards (IFRS) to provide a narrative explanation of \nthe major differences between Swiss GAAP banking law (true \nand fair view) and its primary accounting standard.\n\nThe principal provisions of the Swiss Ordinance on Banks and \nSavings Banks (Banking Ordinance) and the FINMA Circular \n2015/1, \xe2\x80\x9cAccounting \xe2\x80\x93 banks\xe2\x80\x9d, governing financial reporting for \nbanks (Swiss GAAP) differ in certain aspects from US GAAP. \nThe following are the major differences:\n > Refer to \xe2\x80\x9cNote\xc2\xa01 \xe2\x80\x93 Summary of significant accounting policies\xe2\x80\x9d for a detailed \n\ndescription of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s accounting policies.\n\nScope of consolidation\n\nUnder Swiss GAAP, majority-owned subsidiaries that are not \nconsidered long-term investments or do not operate in the core \nbusiness of the Group are either accounted for as financial \ninvestments or as equity method investments. US GAAP has no \nsuch exception relating to the consolidation of majority-owned \nsubsidiaries.\n\nForeign currency translations\n\nUnder US GAAP, foreign currency translation adjustments result-\ning from the consolidation of branches with functional currencies \nother than the Swiss franc are included in AOCI in shareholders\xe2\x80\x99 \nequity. Under Swiss GAAP, foreign currency translation adjust-\nments from the consolidation of foreign branches are recognized \nin net income/(loss) from trading activities and fair value option. \n\nUnder US GAAP, foreign currency measurement adjustments for \navailable-for-sale securities are reported in AOCI, which is part \nof total shareholder\xe2\x80\x99s equity, whereas for Swiss GAAP statutory \npurposes they are included in the statements of income.\n\nInvestments in securities\n\nUnder Swiss GAAP, classification and measurement of invest-\nments in securities depends on the nature of the investment.\n\nNon-consolidated participations\nUnder US GAAP, investments in equity securities where a com-\npany has the ability to significantly influence the operating and \nfinancial policies of an investee are accounted for under the equity \nmethod of accounting or the fair value option. Under the equity \n\nmethod of accounting, a company\xe2\x80\x99s share of the profit or loss as \nwell as any impairment on the participation are reported in other \nrevenues. \n\nUnder Swiss GAAP, investments in equity securities which are \nheld with the intention of a permanent investment or which are \ninvestments in financial industry infrastructure are included in \nparticipations irrespective of the percentage ownership of voting \nshares held. Other participating interests are initially recognized at \nhistorical cost and tested for impairment at least annually. The fair \nvalue option is not allowed for participations.\n\nFor the purpose of testing a company\xe2\x80\x99s participating interests \nfor impairment, the portfolio method is applied. Impairment is \nrecorded if the carrying value of a portfolio of participating inter-\nests exceeds its fair value. Should the fair value of the portfolio \nrecover subsequently after an impairment and such recovery is \nconsidered sustainable, the impairment from prior periods can \nbe reversed up to fair value but not exceeding the historical cost \nbasis. A reversal of the impairment is recorded as extraordinary \nincome in the statements of income.\n\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities\nUnder US GAAP, available-for-sale debt securities are valued at \nfair value. Unrealized gains and losses due to fluctuations in fair \nvalue (including foreign exchange) are not recorded in the consoli-\ndated statements of operations but included net of tax in AOCI, \nwhich is part of total shareholders\xe2\x80\x99 equity. Declines in fair value \nbelow cost deemed to be other-than-temporary are recognized as \nimpairments in the consolidated statements of operations, except \nfor amounts relating to factors other than credit loss on debt \nsecurities with no intent or requirement to sell that continue to be \nincluded in AOCI. The new cost basis will not be changed for sub-\nsequent recoveries in fair value.\n\nUnder Swiss GAAP, available-for-sale securities are accounted \nfor at the lower of amortized cost or market with valuation reduc-\ntions and recoveries due to market fluctuations recorded in other \nordinary expenses and income, respectively. Foreign exchange \ngains and losses are recognized in net income/(loss) from trading \nactivities and fair value option.\n\nNon-marketable equity securities\nUnder US GAAP, equity securities which do not have a readily \ndeterminable fair value are measured in accordance with the NAV \npractical expedient by using the measurement alternative or at fair \nvalue.\n\nUnder Swiss GAAP, non-marketable equity securities are carried \nat the lower of cost or market.\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n411\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nImpairments on held-to-maturity securities\nUnder US GAAP, declines in fair value of held-to-maturity securi-\nties below cost deemed to be other-than-temporary are recog-\nnized as impairments in the consolidated statements of operations \nexcept for amounts relating to factors other than credit loss on \ndebt securities held with no intent or requirement to sell that are \nincluded in AOCI. The impairment cannot be reversed in future \nperiods.\n\nUnder Swiss GAAP, all impairments are recognized in the con-\nsolidated statements of income. Impairments recognized on held-\nto-maturity securities are reversed up to the amortized cost if the \nfair value of the instrument subsequently recovers. A reversal is \nrecorded in the consolidated statements of income.\n\nFair value option\n\nUnlike US GAAP, Swiss GAAP generally does not allow the fair \nvalue option concept that creates an optional alternative measure-\nment treatment for certain non-trading financial assets and liabili-\nties, guarantees and commitments. The fair value option permits \nthe use of fair value for initial and subsequent measurement with \nchanges in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of \noperations. \n\nFor issued structured products that meet certain conditions, fair \nvalue measurement can be applied. The related changes in fair \nvalue of both the embedded derivative and the host contract are \nrecorded in trading revenues, except for fair value adjustments \nrelating to own credit that cannot be recognized in the consoli-\ndated statements of income. Impacts of changes in own credit \nspreads are recognized in the compensation accounts which are \neither recorded in other assets or other liabilities.\n\nDerivative financial instruments used for fair value \nhedging\n\nUnder US GAAP, the full amount of unrealized gains or losses \non derivatives classified as hedging instruments and the corre-\nsponding losses or gains on the hedged items are recognized in \nincome. Hedging ineffectiveness is recorded in trading income.\n\nUnder Swiss GAAP, the carrying value of hedged items is not \nadjusted. The amount representing the change in fair value of \nthe hedged item due to the risk being hedged is recorded in the \ncompensation account included in other assets or other liabilities. \nHedging ineffectiveness is recorded in net income/(loss) from \ntrading activities and fair value option.\n\nDerivative financial instruments used for cash \nflow hedging\n\nUnder US GAAP, the effective portion of a cash flow hedge is \nreported in AOCI. \n\nUnder Swiss GAAP, the effective portion of a cash flow hedge is \nrecorded in the compensation account included in other assets or \nother liabilities.\n\nDerecognition of financial instruments\n\nUnder US GAAP, financial instruments are only derecognized if \nthe transaction meets the following criteria: (i)\xc2\xa0the financial asset \nhas been legally isolated from the transferor, (ii)\xc2\xa0the transferee \nhas the right to repledge or resell the transferred asset, and \n(iii)\xc2\xa0the transferor does not maintain effective control over the \ntransferred asset.\n\nUnder Swiss GAAP, a financial instrument is derecognized when \nthe economic control has been transferred from the seller to \nthe buyer. A party which has the controlling ability to receive the \nfuture returns from the financial instrument and the obligation to \nabsorb the risk of the financial instrument is deemed to have eco-\nnomic control over a financial instrument.\n\nDebt issuance costs\n\nUnder US GAAP, debt issuance costs are presented as a direct \ndeduction from the carrying amount of the related debt.\n\nUnder Swiss GAAP, debt issuance costs are reported as a bal-\nance sheet asset in accrued income and prepaid expenses.\n\nGoodwill amortization\n\nUnder US GAAP, goodwill is not amortized but must be tested for \nimpairment annually or more frequently if an event or change in \ncircumstances indicates that the goodwill may be impaired.\n\nUnder Swiss GAAP, goodwill is amortized over its useful life, gen-\nerally not exceeding five years, except for justified cases where a \nmaximum useful life of up to ten years is acceptable. In addition, \ngoodwill is tested at least annually for impairment.\n\nAmortization of intangible assets\n\nUnder US GAAP, intangible assets with indefinite lives are not \namortized but are tested for impairment annually or more fre-\nquently if an event or change in circumstances indicates that the \nasset may be impaired.\n\nUnder Swiss GAAP, intangible assets are amortized over a useful \nlife, up to a maximum of five years, in justified cases up to a max-\nimum of ten years. In addition, these assets are tested at least \nannually for impairment.\n\nGuarantees\n\nUS GAAP requires all guarantees to be initially recognized \nat fair value. Upon issuance of a guarantee, the guarantor is \nrequired to recognize a liability that reflects the initial fair value; \n\n412\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nsimultaneously, a receivable is recorded to reflect the future guar-\nantee fee income over the entire life of the guarantee.\n\nUnder Swiss GAAP, only accrued or prepaid guarantee fees are \nrecorded on the balance sheet. No guarantee liability and receiv-\nable for future guarantee fees are recorded upon issuance of a \nguarantee.\n\nLoan origination fees and costs\n\neconomic obligation. Employer contribution reserves must be \ncapitalized if they represent a future economic benefit. A future \neconomic benefit exists if the employer can reduce its future \nstatutory annual contribution to the pension plan by releasing \nemployer contribution reserves. Pension expenses include the \nrequired contributions defined by Swiss law, any additional contri-\nbution mandated by the pension fund trustees and any change in \nvalue of the pension asset or liability between two measurement \ndates as determined on the basis of the annual year-end pension \nplan valuation.\n\nUS GAAP requires the deferral of fees received upfront and \ndirect costs incurred in connection with the origination of loans \nnot held under the fair value option.\n\nDiscontinued operations\n\nUnder Swiss GAAP, only upfront payments or fees that are con-\nsidered interest-related components are deferred (e.g., premiums \nand discounts). Fees received from the borrower which are con-\nsidered service-related fees such as commitment fees, structur-\ning fees and arrangement fees are immediately recognized in \ncommission income.\n\nSale and leaseback transactions\n\nUnder US GAAP, gains from the sale of property subject to a \nsale and leaseback arrangement are deferred and amortized over \nthe leaseback period.\n\nUnder Swiss GAAP, gains from the sale of property subject to a \nsale and leaseback arrangement are only deferred if the provi-\nsions of the leaseback contract indicate that the leaseback is a \ncapital lease; if the leaseback contract meets the requirements of \nan operating lease, such gains are immediately recognized upon \nsale of the property.\n\nExtraordinary income and expenses\n\nUnlike US GAAP, Swiss GAAP does report certain expenses or \nrevenues as extraordinary if the recorded income or expense is \nnon-operating and non-recurring.\n\nPensions and post-retirement benefits\n\nUnder US GAAP, the liability and related pension expense is \ndetermined based on the projected unit credit actuarial calculation \nof the benefit obligation.\n\nUnder Swiss GAAP, the liability and related pension expense \nis primarily determined based on the pension plan valuation \nin accordance with Swiss GAAP FER\xc2\xa026. A pension asset is \nrecorded if a statutory overfunding of a pension plan leads to \na future economic benefit, and a pension liability is recorded \nif a statutory underfunding of a pension plan leads to a future \n\nUnder US GAAP, the assets and liabilities of a discontinued \noperation are separated from the ordinary captions of the con-\nsolidated balance sheets and are reported as discontinued opera-\ntions measured at the lower of the carrying value or fair value less \ncost to sell. Accordingly, income and expense from discontinued \noperations are reported in a separate line item of the consolidated \nstatements of operations.\n\nUnder Swiss GAAP, these positions remain in their initial bal-\nance sheet captions until disposed of and continue to be valued \naccording to the respective captions.\n\nSecurity collateral received in securities lending \ntransactions\n\nUnder US GAAP, security collateral received in securities lending \ntransactions are recorded as assets and a corresponding liability \nto return the collateral is recognized. \n\nUnder Swiss GAAP, security collateral received and the obligation \nto return collateral of securities lending transactions are not rec-\nognized on the balance sheet.\n\nLoan commitments\n\nUnder US GAAP, loan commitments include all commitments to \nextend loans, unfunded commitments under commercial lines of \ncredit, revolving credit lines, credit guarantees in the future and \noverdraft protection agreements, except for commitments that \ncan be revoked by the Group at any time at the Group\xe2\x80\x99s sole dis-\ncretion without prior notice.\n\nUnder Swiss GAAP, loan commitments include all commitments \nto extend loans, unfunded commitments under commercial lines \nof credit, revolving credit lines, credit guarantees in the future and \noverdraft protection agreements, except for commitments that \ncan be revoked by the Group at any time at the Group\xe2\x80\x99s sole dis-\ncretion with a notice period not exceeding six weeks.\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n413\n\n\x0c \n\nControls and procedures\n\n \n\nManagement has made an evaluation and assessment of the \nGroup\xe2\x80\x99s internal control over financial reporting as of December \n31, 2018 using the criteria issued in 2013 by the Committee of \nSponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) \nin \xe2\x80\x9cInternal Control \xe2\x80\x93 Integrated Framework\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nBased upon its review and evaluation, management, including the \nGroup CEO and CFO, has concluded that the Group\xe2\x80\x99s internal \ncontrol over financial reporting is effective as of December 31, \n2018.\n\nThe Group\xe2\x80\x99s independent auditors, KPMG AG, have issued an \nunqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s inter-\nnal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, as \nstated in their report, which follows.\n\nChanges in internal control over \nfinancial reporting\nThere were no changes in the Group\xe2\x80\x99s internal control over finan-\ncial reporting during the period covered by this report that have \nmaterially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, \nthe Group\xe2\x80\x99s internal control over financial reporting.\n\nEvaluation of disclosure controls \nand procedures\nThe Group has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and \noperation of its disclosure controls and procedures as of the end \nof the period covered by this report under the supervision and \nwith the participation of management, including the Group Chief \nExecutive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), pur-\nsuant to Rule 13(a)-15(a) under the Securities Exchange Act of \n1934 (the Exchange Act). There are inherent limitations to the \neffectiveness of any system of controls and procedures, including \nthe possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding \nof the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective con-\ntrols and procedures can only provide reasonable assurance of \nachieving their control objectives.\n\nThe CEO and CFO concluded that, as of December 31, 2018, \nthe design and operation of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure controls and \nprocedures were effective, in all material respects, to ensure that \ninformation required to be disclosed in reports filed and submitted \nunder the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and \nreported as and when required.\n\nManagement report on internal \ncontrol over financial reporting\nThe management of the Group is responsible for establishing \nand maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. \nThe Group\xe2\x80\x99s internal control over financial reporting is a process \ndesigned to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability \nof financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements \nfor external purposes in accordance with US GAAP. Because \nof its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting \nmay not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any \nevaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the \nrisk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in \nconditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or pro-\ncedures may deteriorate.\n\n414\n\nConsolidated financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nReport of the Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm \nTo the shareholders and Board of Directors \nCredit Suisse Group AG, Zurich \n_____________________________________________________________________ \nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting \nWe  have  audited  Credit  Suisse  Group  AG  and  subsidiaries'  (the  \xe2\x80\x9cGroup\xe2\x80\x9d)  internal  control  over  financial \nreporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control \xe2\x80\x93 Integrated Framework \n(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, \nthe  Group  maintained,  in  all  material  respects,  effective  internal  control  over  financial  reporting  as  of \nDecember 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control \xe2\x80\x93 Integrated Framework (2013) issued \nby the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.   \nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board \n(United States) (\xe2\x80\x9cPCAOB\xe2\x80\x9d), the consolidated balance sheets of the Group as of December 31, 2018 and \n2017, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, changes in equity, and \ncash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes \n(collectively, the \xe2\x80\x9cconsolidated financial statements\xe2\x80\x9d), and our report dated March 22, 2019 expressed an \nunqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements. \n\nBasis for Opinion  \nThe Group\xe2\x80\x99s Board of Directors and management are responsible for maintaining effective internal control \nover financial reporting and the Group\xe2\x80\x99s management is responsible for its assessment of the effectiveness \nof internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management Report on Internal \nControl over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Group\xe2\x80\x99s internal control \nover financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and \nare required to be independent with respect to the Group in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws \nand the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. \nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we \nplan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over \nfinancial  reporting  was  maintained  in  all  material  respects.  Our  audit  of  internal  control  over  financial \nreporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk \nthat a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal \ncontrol  based  on  the  assessed  risk.

This responsibility includes \ndesigning, implementing and maintaining an internal control system relevant to the preparation of financial \nstatements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The Board of Directors \nis  further  responsible  for  selecting  and  applying  appropriate  accounting  policies  and  making  accounting \nestimates that are reasonable in the circumstances. \n\nAuditor\xe2\x80\x99s Responsibility \n\nOur responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audit. We conducted \nour audit in accordance with Swiss law and Swiss Auditing Standards. Those standards require that we plan \nand perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance whether the financial statements are free from material \nmisstatement.  \nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the \nfinancial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, including the assessment \nof the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making \nthose risk assessments, the auditor considers the internal control system relevant to the entity\xe2\x80\x99s preparation \nof the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but \nnot for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity\xe2\x80\x99s internal control system. An \naudit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness \nof accounting estimates made, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We \nbelieve that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit \nopinion. \n\nOpinion \n\nIn our opinion, the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018, comply with Swiss law and \nCredit Suisse Group AG\xe2\x80\x99s articles of association. \n \n\n \n\n \n\nParent company financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n419\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nReport on Key Audit Matters based on the circular 1/2015 of the Federal Audit Oversight \nAuthority \n\n \n\nValuation of participations \n\n \nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the\nfinancial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial\nstatements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these\nmatters. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nValuation of participations \n\n    \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nKey Audit Matter \n\nOur response \n\nCredit  Suisse  Group  AG  reports  participations  of  CHF \n52.1 billion as of December 31, 2018. The participations \nportfolio  consists  of  investments  in  subsidiary  entities \nmainly operating in the banking and finance industry. \n\nParticipations  are  valued  at  acquisition  cost \nless \nimpairment. For the purpose of impairment testing, the \nportfolio  valuation  method  is  applied  for  economically \nclosely related participations. All other participations are \nvalued \nindividually.  The  valuation  of  participations \ninvolves  judgment  in  the  projections  and  assumptions \nused, which are sensitive to the expected future market \ndevelopments that could affect the profitability of these \nentities. \n\nimpairments, \n\nWe assessed and tested the design and implementation of \nthe key controls over financial reporting with respect to the \nvaluation of participations. This included controls over the \nidentification  and  measurement  of \nthe \nevaluation  of  the  valuation  methodology,  key  inputs  and \nassumptions used in the determination of the participation \nvalue, and management\xe2\x80\x99s annual comparison of legal entity \nplans to past performance. \n \nFor  a  sample  of  participations,  we  evaluated  key \nassumptions applied in performing the valuation.

The financial statements of \nCredit Suisse Group AG are prepared in accordance with the reg-\nulations of the Swiss Code of Obligations and are stated in Swiss \nfrancs (CHF). The financial year ends on December\xc2\xa031.\n\nThe average number of employees (full-time equivalents) for the \ncurrent year, as well as for the previous year, did not exceed 50.\n\nSubsequent events\n\nThere were no subsequent events from the balance sheet date \nuntil March 22, 2019, the publishing date of these financial \nstatements.\n\n2  Accounting and valuation principles\n\nInterest-bearing liabilities\n\nShort-term and long-term interest-bearing liabilities are carried at \nnominal value.\n\nTreasury shares\n\nOwn shares are recorded at cost and reported as treasury shares, \nresulting in a reduction to total shareholders\xe2\x80\x99 equity. Realized gains \nand losses on the sale of own shares are recognized through \nthe statements of income as other financial income or financial \nexpenses.\n\nRevenue recognition\n\nRevenues are recognized when they are realized or realizable, and \nare earned. Dividend income is recorded in the reporting period in \nwhich the dividend is declared.\n\nForeign currency translations\n\nAssets and liabilities of foreign branches are translated into Swiss \nfrancs at the exchange rates prevailing at year-end. Income and \nexpense items are translated at weighted average exchange rates \nfor the period. All currency translation effects are recognized in \nother financial income or financial expense. \n\nForeign currency translation rates\nEnd of\xc2\xa0 \n1 USD / 1 CHF\xc2\xa0 \n\n2018   \n0.99   \n\n2017 \n0.98 \n\nThese financial statements were prepared in accordance with the \nprovisions of the Swiss Law on Accounting and Financial Report-\ning (32nd title of the Swiss Code of Obligations). \n\nCash and cash equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents are carried at nominal value.\n\nDerivative financial instruments\n\nDerivative financial instruments reported in this balance sheet line \nitem are carried at the lower of cost or market. Realized gains are \nrecorded in other financial income, realized and unrealized losses \nare recognized in financial expenses.\n\nFinancial investments\n\nFinancial investments include debt securities with a remaining \nmaturity of more than 12 months after the balance sheet date. \nThese securities are carried at cost. No valuation adjustments or \nimpairment losses were required.\n\nParticipations\n\nParticipations are valued at historical cost less impairment. \nFor the purpose of impairment testing, with a clearly defined \nsub-portfolio of economically closely related participations, the \nportfolio valuation method is applied. Impairment is assessed at \neach balance sheet date or at any point in time when facts and \ncircumstances would indicate that an event has occurred which \ntriggers an impairment review. The amount of impairment, if any, \nis assessed on the level of this sub-portfolio and not individually \nfor each participation. All other participations are valued individu-\nally. An impairment is recorded if the carrying value exceeds the \nfair value of the participation sub-portfolio. If the fair value of par-\nticipations recovers significantly and is considered sustainable, a \nprior period impairment can be reversed up to the historical cost \nvalue of the participations.\n\nParent company financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n423\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\n3  Other financial income\n\n8  Other short-term receivables\n\nin\xc2\xa0 \n\n2018   \n\n2017 \n\nend of\xc2\xa0 \n\n \n\nOther financial income (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \nInterest income\xc2\xa0 \n942   \nRealized and unrealized gains on derivative financial instruments\xc2\xa0  169   \nGains on sale of treasury shares\xc2\xa0 \n21   \n0   \nForeign exchange gains\xc2\xa0 \nOther financial income\xc2\xa0 \n1,132   \n\n \n\n4  Other operating income\n\nin\xc2\xa0 \n\nOther operating income (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \nTrademark fees\xc2\xa0 \nManagement fees\xc2\xa0 \nGuarantee fees\xc2\xa0 \nOther\xc2\xa0 \nOther operating income\xc2\xa0 \n\n \n\n \n\n5  Financial expenses\n\nin\xc2\xa0 \n\n2018   \n\n63   \n57   \n26   \n1   \n147   \n\n2018   \n\n \n\n \n\nFinancial expenses (CHF million)\xc2\xa0 \nInterest expenses\xc2\xa0 \n988   \nRealized and unrealized losses on derivative financial instruments\xc2\xa0 172   \n11   \nLosses on sale of treasury shares\xc2\xa0 \nForeign exchange losses\xc2\xa0 \n1   \n0   \nOther\xc2\xa0 \nFinancial expenses\xc2\xa0 \n1,172   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n587 \n75 \n18 \n5 \n685 \n\n2017 \n\n69 \n73 \n29 \n0 \n171 \n\n2017 \n\n623 \n78 \n0 \n0 \n3 \n704 \n\nOther short-term receivables (CHF million)\xc2\xa0  \nReceivables for trademark fees\xc2\xa0 \nDebt securities\xc2\xa0 \nOther\xc2\xa0 \nOther short-term receivables\xc2\xa0 \n\n2018   \n\n2017 \n\n \n\n \n\n223   \n0   \n35   \n258   \n\n207 \n290 \n12 \n509 \n\n9   Accrued income and prepaid \n\nexpenses\n\nend of\xc2\xa0 \n\nAccrued income and prepaid expenses (CHF million)\xc2\xa0   \nAccrued interest income\xc2\xa0 \nDeferred debt issuance costs\xc2\xa0 \nUnamortized discount on notes issued\xc2\xa0 \nOther\xc2\xa0 \nAccrued income and prepaid expenses\xc2\xa0 \n\n2018   \n\n2017 \n\n \n\n \n\n328   \n139   \n11   \n4   \n482   \n\n161 \n86 \n12 \n10 \n269 \n\nCredit Suisse Group AG hedges an open interest rate risk expo-\nsure from a fixed rate liability with a nominal amount of USD\xc2\xa01.0 \nbillion with a fixed receiver interest rate swap with equivalent \nnotional.

of these zero coupon accreting senior callable notes reflects the yield rate of the notes.\n\nThe high-trigger and low-trigger tier 1 capital notes issued by \nCredit Suisse Group AG are perpetual securities and have no \nfixed or final maturity date. Subject to the satisfaction of certain \nconditions, they may be redeemed, at the option of the issuer, on \nthe first call date or on any interest rate reset date thereafter.\n\nThe high-trigger tier 1 capital notes mandatorily either convert \ninto ordinary shares of Credit Suisse Group AG or are perma-\nnently written-down to zero, as provided in the terms of the \nrespective instrument, upon the occurrence of certain specified \ntriggering events. These events include the Group\xe2\x80\x99s consoli-\ndated common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio falling below 7%, or a \n\ndetermination by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Author-\nity FINMA (FINMA) that conversion or write-down is necessary, \nor that Credit Suisse Group AG requires extraordinary public \nsector capital support, to prevent Credit Suisse Group AG from \nbecoming insolvent, bankrupt or unable to pay a material amount \nof its debt, or other similar circumstances. Conversion or write-\ndown can only be prevented if FINMA, at Credit Suisse Group \nAG\xe2\x80\x99s request, is satisfied that certain conditions exist and deter-\nmines that a conversion or write-down is not required. High-trig-\nger instruments are designed to absorb losses before other capi-\ntal instruments, including the low-trigger capital instruments.\n\n426\n\nParent company financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nThe low-trigger tier 1 capital notes have a write-down feature, \nwhich means that interest on the notes shall cease to accrue and \nthe full principal amount of the notes will be permanently written \ndown to zero upon the occurrence of certain specified trigger-\ning events, also called write-down events. A write-down event \nwill occur if the sum of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s consolidated CET1 ratio and \nthe Higher Trigger Capital Ratio (i.e., the ratio of Higher Trigger \nCapital Amount to the aggregate of all risk-weighted assets of the \nGroup) as of any quarterly balance sheet date or interim capital \nreport date is below 5.125%. A write-down event will also occur \nif FINMA determines that a write-down of the notes is necessary, \nor that Credit Suisse Group AG requires, extraordinary public \nsector capital support to prevent Credit Suisse Group AG from \nbecoming insolvent, bankrupt or unable to pay a material part of \nits debts, or other similar circumstances. Write-down can only \nbe prevented if FINMA, at the Group\xe2\x80\x99s request, is satisfied that \ncertain conditions exist and determines that a conversion or write-\ndown is not required.\n\nIn addition to the high-trigger and low-trigger tier 1 capital notes, \nCredit Suisse Group AG has issued senior unsecured notes, \nwhich qualify as total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC). The \nsenior unsecured notes have a fixed maturity date and can be \nredeemed, at the option of the issuer, at the call date. The senior \nunsecured notes are bail-in debt instruments that are designed to \nabsorb losses after the cancellation of Credit Suisse Group AG\xe2\x80\x99s \nequity instruments and after the write-down or conversion into \nequity of regulatory capital (including high-trigger and low-trigger \ntier 1 capital notes) in restructuring proceedings with respect to \nCredit Suisse Group AG. Bail-in debt instruments do not feature \ncapital triggers that may lead to a write-down and/or a conversion \ninto equity outside of restructuring, but only begin to bear losses \nonce Credit Suisse Group AG is formally in restructuring proceed-\nings and FINMA orders capital measures (i.e., a write-down and/\nor a conversion into equity) in the restructuring plan.\n\n15  Share capital, conditional, conversion and authorized capital \n\n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \nShare capital as of December 31, 2017\xc2\xa0 \n\nNo. of   \nregistered shares   \n   \n\nPar value   \nin CHF   \n   \n\nNo. of   \nregistered shares   \n2,556,011,720   \n\nPar value \nin CHF \n102,240,469 \n\nConditional capital\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \nWarrants and convertible bonds\xc2\xa0 \nCapital as of December 31, 2017\xc2\xa0 \nCapital as of December 31, 2018\xc2\xa0 \n\nConversion capital\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \nCapital as of December 31, 2017\xc2\xa0 \nCapital as of December 31, 2018\xc2\xa0 \n\nAuthorized capital\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \nCapital as of December 31, 2017\xc2\xa0 \nCapital as of December 31, 2018\xc2\xa0 \nShare capital as of December 31, 2018\xc2\xa0 \n\n   \n400,000,000   \n400,000,000   1 \n\n150,000,000   \n150,000,000   2 \n\n165,118,230   \n165,118,230   \n   \n\n   \n16,000,000   \n16,000,000   \n\n6,000,000   \n6,000,000   \n\n6,604,729   \n6,604,729   \n   \n\n   \n   \n   \n\n   \n   \n\n   \n   \n2,556,011,720   \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n102,240,469 \n\n1 72.2 million registered shares reserved for the USD 1,500 million 7.125% high-trigger tier 1 capital notes.\n2 39.0 million registered shares reserved for the USD 1,500 million 7.125% high-trigger tier 1 capital notes.\n\n16  Credit Suisse Group shares held by subsidiaries\n\n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\nBalance at end of financial year \n \n \n \n \nPhysical holdings\xc2\xa0 \nHoldings, net of pending obligations\xc2\xa0 \n\n1 Representing 0.2% of issued shares as of December 31, 2018.\n\n   \n\n2018       \n\n2017 \nShare   Market value \nequivalents   (CHF million)    equivalents   (CHF million) \n\nShare   Market value   \n\n5,022,410   1 \n(1,334,536)   \n\n54    5,012,413   \n(14)   \n(607,300)   \n\n \n \n \n \n87 \n(11) \n\nParent company financial statements \xe2\x80\x93 Credit Suisse Group\n\n427\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\n \n\n \n \n \n15.64 \n16.55 \n16.36 \n \n\n16.38 \n\n \n \n \n13.12 \n15.22 \n14.80 \n \n\n15.64 \n\n2017 \nShare- \nholding \n(%) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n12.88 \n5.49 \n\n \n\n \n\n17  Purchases and sales of treasury shares\n\nNet gain/(loss)   \non sale   \n(CHF million)   \n\nTreasury shares,   \nat cost   \n(CHF million)   \n\n   \nNumber   \nof shares   \n\nAverage price  \nper share \n(CHF) \n\n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\n2018\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \nBalance as of December 31, 2017\xc2\xa0 \nSale of treasury shares\xc2\xa01 \nPurchase of treasury shares\xc2\xa0 \nChange in 2018\xc2\xa0 \nBalance as of December 31, 2018\xc2\xa0 \n\n2017\xc2\xa0 \n \n \n \nBalance as of December 31, 2016\xc2\xa0 \nSale of treasury shares\xc2\xa01 \nPurchase of treasury shares\xc2\xa0 \nChange in 2017\xc2\xa0 \nBalance as of December 31, 2017\xc2\xa0 \n\n   \n10   \n   \n10   \n   \n\n   \n18   \n   \n18   \n   \n\n12   \n(762)   \n757   \n(5)   \n7   \n\n2   \n(620)   \n630   \n10   \n12   \n\n745,253   \n(46,612,198)   \n46,272,226   \n(339,972)   \n405,281   \n\n142,534   \n(41,984,328)   \n42,587,047   \n602,719   \n745,253   \n\n2018: Highest price CHF 18.63, paid on January 24 and lowest price CHF 15.46, paid on April 4 in a market transaction.\n2017: Highest price CHF 16.40, paid on November 22 and lowest price CHF 14.31, paid on July 3 in a market transaction.\n1 Representing share award settlements with Group employees.\n\n18  Significant shareholders\n\n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \n\xc2\xa0 \nend of\xc2\xa0 \n\nDirect shareholders\xc2\xa01 \n \n \n \n \n \nChase Nominees Ltd.\xc2\xa02 \nNortrust Nominees Ltd.\xc2\xa02 \n\n       \n\nNumber   Total nominal   \nof shares   \nvalue   \n(million)   (CHF million)   \n\n2018   \nShare-   \nholding   \n(%)   \n\n       \n\nNumber   Total nominal   \nof shares   \nvalue   \n(million)   (CHF million)   \n\n388   \n149   \n\n16   \n6   \n\n15.19   \n5.84   \n\n329   \n140   \n\n13   \n6   \n\n1 As registered in the share register of the Group on December 31 of the reporting period;

\nAdvanced execution services\xc2\xae (AES\xc2\xae)\xc2\xa0AES\xc2\xae is a suite of algorithmic trad-\ning strategies, tools and analytics operated by Credit Suisse to facilitate global \nequity trading. By employing algorithms to execute client orders and limit volatil-\nity, AES\xc2\xae helps institutions and hedge funds reduce market impact. AES\xc2\xae pro-\nvides access to exchanges in more than 35 countries worldwide via more than \n45 leading trading platforms.\nAdvanced internal ratings-based approach (A-IRB)\xc2\xa0Under the A-IRB \napproach, risk weights are determined by using internal risk parameters. We \nhave received approval from FINMA to use, and have fully implemented, the \nA-IRB approach whereby we provide our own estimates for probability of default \n(PD), loss given default (LGD) and exposure at default (EAD). We use the \nA-IRB approach to determine our institutional credit risk and most of our retail \ncredit risk.\nAdvanced measurement approach (AMA)\xc2\xa0The AMA is used for measuring \noperational risk. The methodology is based upon the identification of a number \nof key risk scenarios that describe the major operational risks we face. Groups \nof senior staff review each scenario and discuss the likelihood of occurrence \nand the potential severity of loss. Internal and external loss data, along with cer-\ntain business environment and internal control factors, such as self-assessment \nresults and key risk indicators, are considered as part of this process. Based \non the output from these meetings, we enter the scenario parameters into an \noperational risk model that generates a loss distribution from which the level \nof capital required to cover operational risk is determined. We have received \napproval from FINMA to use an internal model for the calculation of operational \nrisk capital, which is aligned with the requirements of the AMA under the Basel \nframework.\nAffluent and retail clients\xc2\xa0We define affluent and retail clients as individuals \nhaving assets under management below CHF 1 million.\nAmerican Depositary Shares (ADS)\xc2\xa0An ADS, which is evidenced by an \nAmerican Depositary Receipt, is a negotiable certificate issued by a depositary \nbank that represents all or part of an underlying share of a foreign-based com-\npany held in custody.\n\nB \nBacktesting\xc2\xa0Backtesting is one of the techniques used to assess the accuracy \nand performance of VaR models. Backtesting is used by regulators to assess \nthe adequacy of regulatory capital held by a bank. It involves comparing of the \nresults produced by the VaR model with the hypothetical trading revenues on \nthe trading book. VaR models that experience less than five exceptions in a roll-\ning 12-month period are considered by regulators to be classified in a defined \n\xe2\x80\x9cgreen zone\xe2\x80\x9d. The \xe2\x80\x9cgreen zone\xe2\x80\x9d corresponds to backtesting results that do not \nthemselves suggest a problem with the quality or accuracy of a bank\xe2\x80\x99s model.\nBank for International Settlements (BIS)\xc2\xa0The Bank for International Settle-\nments (BIS) serves central banks in their pursuit of monetary and financial \nstability, fosters international cooperation in those areas and acts as a bank for \ncentral banks.\nBasel III\xc2\xa0In December 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision \n(BCBS) issued the Basel III framework, which is a comprehensive set of reform \nmeasures to strengthen the regulation, supervision and risk management of the \nbanking sector. These measures aim to improve the banking sector\xe2\x80\x99s ability to \nabsorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress, whatever the source, \nimprove risk management and governance and strengthen banks\xe2\x80\x99 transparency \nand disclosures. The phase-in period for Basel III was January 1, 2013 through \nJanuary 1, 2019.\nBasel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS)\xc2\xa0The Basel Commit-\ntee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) provides a forum for regular cooperation \non banking supervisory matters. Its objective is to enhance the understand-\ning of key supervisory issues and improve the quality of banking supervision \nworldwide. It seeks to do so by exchanging information on national supervisory \nissues, approaches and techniques, with a view to promoting common under-\nstanding. At times, the BCBS uses this common understanding to develop \nguidelines and supervisory standards in areas where they are considered desir-\nable. In this regard, the BCBS is best known for its international standards on \ncapital adequacy, the Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision and the \nConcordat on cross-border banking supervision.\nBooking center\xc2\xa0Part of a legal entity of Credit Suisse AG that is registered \nwith a domestic banking license where client assets are administered and \nbooked.\n\nA-6\n\nGlossary\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nC \nCollateralized debt obligation (CDO)\xc2\xa0A CDO is a type of structured asset-\nbacked security whose value and payments are derived from a portfolio of \nunderlying fixed-income assets.\nCommercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS)\xc2\xa0CMBS are a type of \nmortgage-backed security that is secured by loans on commercial property and \ncan provide liquidity to real estate investors and commercial lenders.\nCommercial paper (CP)\xc2\xa0Commercial paper is an unsecured money-market \nsecurity with a fixed maturity of 1 to 364 days, issued by large banks and cor-\nporations to raise funds to meet short term debt obligations.\nConstant prepayment rate (CPR)\xc2\xa0CPR is a loan prepayment rate that is \nequal to the proportion of the principal of a pool of loans that is assumed to be \npaid off prematurely in each period. The calculation of this estimate is based on \na number of factors such as historical prepayment rates for previous loans that \nare similar to ones in the pool and on future economic outlooks.\nCredit default swap (CDS)\xc2\xa0A CDS is a contractual agreement in which the \nbuyer of the swap pays a periodic fee in return for a contingent payment by the \nseller of the swap following a credit event of a reference entity. A credit event \nis commonly defined as bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, material adverse \nrestructuring of debt or failure to meet payment obligations when due.\nCredit valuation adjustment (CVA)\xc2\xa0The CVA represents the market value of \ncounterparty credit risk for uncollateralized OTC derivative instruments.\n\nD \nDebit valuation adjustment\xc2\xa0The debit valuation adjustment represents \nthe market value of our own credit risk for uncollateralized OTC derivative \ninstruments.\nDerivatives\xc2\xa0Derivatives are financial instruments or contracts that meet all \nof the following three characteristics: (1) their value changes in response to \nchanges in an underlying price, such as interest rate, security price, foreign \nexchange rate, credit rating/price or index; (2) they require no initial net invest-\nment or an initial net investment that is smaller than would be required for \nother types of contracts that would be expected to have a similar response to \nchanges in market factors; and (3) their terms require or permit net settlement \n(US GAAP) or they settle at a future date (IFRS).\n\nE \nExposure at default (EAD)\xc2\xa0The EAD represents the expected amount of \ncredit exposure in the event of a default and reflects the current drawn exposure \nand an expectation regarding the future evolution of the credit exposure. For \nloan exposures, a credit conversion factor is applied to project the additional \ndrawn amount. The credit conversion factor related to traded products such as \nderivatives is based on a simulation using statistical models.\n\nF \nFair value\xc2\xa0The price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer \na liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measure-\nment date.\n\nG \nG7\xc2\xa0The G7 is a group of finance ministers from seven industrialized nations: the \nUS, UK, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan.\nG10\xc2\xa0The G10 is a group of 11 countries that have agreed to make resources \navailable to the International Monetary Fund and includes Belgium, Canada, \nFrance, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, the UK, the US, Germany, Sweden and \nSwitzerland.\nG20\xc2\xa0The G20 is a group of finance ministers and central bank governors from \n19 countries (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, \nIndia, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, \nSouth Africa, Turkey, the UK and the US) and the EU.\n\nH \nHaircut\xc2\xa0The percentage by which an asset\xe2\x80\x99s market value is reduced for the \npurpose of calculating capital, margin requirements and collateral levels. This is \nused to provide a cushion when lending against collateral to account for possible \nadverse movements in the value of the collateral.\nHigher Trigger Capital Amount\xc2\xa0The capital ratio write-down triggers for \ncertain of our outstanding capital instruments take into account the fact that \nother outstanding capital instruments that contain relatively higher capital ratios \nas part of their trigger feature are expected to convert into equity or be written \ndown prior to the write-down of such capital instruments. The amount of addi-\ntional capital that is expected to be contributed by such conversion into equity or \nwrite-down is referred to as the Higher Trigger Capital Amount.\nHigh-net-worth individuals (HNWI)\xc2\xa0We define high-net-worth individuals as \nindividuals having assets under management in excess of CHF 1 million.\n\nI \nIncremental risk charge (IRC)\xc2\xa0The IRC represents an estimate of the issuer \ndefault and migration risk of positions in the trading book over a one-year capital \nhorizon at a 99.9% confidence level, taking into account the liquidity horizons \nof individual positions. This includes sovereign debt, but excludes securitizations \nand correlation products.\n\nGlossary\n\nA-7\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nL \nLiquidity coverage ratio (LCR)\xc2\xa0The LCR aims to ensure that banks have a \nstock of unencumbered high-quality liquid assets available to meet liquid-\nity needs for a 30-day time horizon under a severe stress scenario. The LCR \nis comprised of two components: the value of the stock of high quality liquid \nassets in stressed conditions and the total net cash outflows calculated accord-\ning to specified scenario parameters. The ratio of liquid assets over net cash \noutflows should be at least 100%.\nLombard loan\xc2\xa0A loan granted against pledged collateral in the form of \nsecurities.\nLondon Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)\xc2\xa0LIBOR is a daily reference rate \nbased on the interest rates at which banks borrow unsecured funds from other \nbanks in the London wholesale money market.\nLoss given default (LGD)\xc2\xa0LGD parameters consider seniority, collateral, coun-\nterparty industry and, in certain cases, fair value markdowns. LGD estimates \nare based on an empirical analysis of historical loss rates and are calibrated to \nreflect time and cost of recovery as well as economic downturn conditions. For \nmuch of the loan portfolio of private banking, corporate and institutional busi-\nnesses, the LGD is primarily dependent upon the type and amount of collateral \npledged. For other retail credit risk, predominantly loans secured by financial \ncollateral, pool LGDs differentiate between standard and higher risks, as well as \ndomestic and foreign transactions. The credit approval and collateral monitoring \nprocesses are based on loan-to-value (LTV) limits. For mortgages (residential or \ncommercial), recovery rates are differentiated by type of property.\n\nM \nMatch funded\xc2\xa0Match funded balance sheet items consist of assets and liabili-\nties with close to equal liquidity durations and value so that the liquidity and \nfunding generated or required by the positions are substantially equivalent.\nMaterial risk takers and controllers (MRTC)\xc2\xa0MRTC are employees who, \neither individually or as a part of a group, are considered to have a potentially \nmaterial impact on the Group\xe2\x80\x99s risk profile.\n\nN \nNegative replacement value (NRV)\xc2\xa0NRV represents the negative fair value \nof a derivative financial instrument at a given financial reporting date. A negative \nreplacement value reflects the amount payable to the counterparty if the deriva-\ntive transaction were to be settled at the reporting date, or alternatively, the cost \nat a given reporting date to close an open derivative position with a fully offset-\nting transaction.\nNet stable funding ratio (NSFR)\xc2\xa0The NSFR is intended to ensure that banks \nmaintain a structurally sound long-term funding profile beyond one year and \nis a complementary measure to the LCR. It is structured to ensure that illiquid \nassets are funded with an appropriate amount of stable long-term funds. The \nstandard is defined as the ratio of available stable funding over the amount of \nrequired stable funding. The ratio should always be at least 100%.\n\nN (continued) \nNetting agreements\xc2\xa0Netting agreements are contracts between two par-\nties where under certain circumstances, such as insolvency, bankruptcy or any \nother credit event, mutual claims from outstanding business transactions can be \noffset against each other. The inclusion of a legally binding netting agreement \nreduces the default risk from a gross to a net amount.\n\nO \nOver-the-counter (OTC)\xc2\xa0Over-the-counter securities and derivatives are not \ntraded on an exchange but via private contracts between counterparties.\n\nP \nPosition risk\xc2\xa0Component of the economic capital framework, which is used to \nassess, monitor and report risk exposures throughout the Group. Position risk is \nthe level of unexpected loss in economic value on our portfolio of positions over \na one-year horizon which is exceeded with a given small probability (1% for risk \nmanagement purposes; 0.03% for capital management purposes).\nPositive replacement value (PRV)\xc2\xa0PRV represents the positive fair value of \na derivative financial instrument at a given reporting date. A positive replace-\nment value reflects the amount receivable from the counterparty if the derivative \ntransaction were to be settled at the reporting date, or alternatively, the cost at \na given reporting date to enter into the exact same transaction for the residual \nterm, if the existing counterparty should default.\nProbability of default (PD)\xc2\xa0PD parameters capture the risk of a counterparty \ndefaulting over a one-year time horizon. PD estimates are based on time-\nweighted averages of historical default rates by rating grade, with low-default-\nportfolio estimation techniques applied for higher quality rating grades. Each PD \nreflects the internal rating for the relevant obligor.\n\nR \nRegulatory VaR\xc2\xa0Regulatory VaR is a version of VaR that uses an exponential \nweighting technique that automatically increases VaR where recent short-term \nmarket volatility is greater than long-term volatility in the two-year dataset. \nRegulatory VaR uses an expected shortfall calculation based on average losses, \nand a ten-day holding period. This results in a more responsive VaR model, as \nthe overall increases in market volatility are reflected almost immediately in the \nregulatory VaR model.\nRepurchase agreements\xc2\xa0Repurchase agreements are securities sold under \nagreements to repurchase substantially identical securities. These transactions \nnormally do not constitute economic sales and are therefore treated as collater-\nalized financing transactions and are carried in the  balance sheet at the amount \nof cash received (liability) and cash disbursed (asset), respectively.\nResidential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS)\xc2\xa0RMBS are a type of \nmortgage-backed security composed of a wide array of different non-commer-\ncial mortgage debts. They securitize the mortgage payments of non-commer-\ncial real estate. Different residential mortgages with varying credit ratings are \npooled together and sold in tranches to investors.\n\nA-8\n\nGlossary\n\n\x0c \n\n \n\nT \n\xe2\x80\x9cToo Big to Fail\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0In 2011, the Swiss Parliament passed legislation relating to \nbig banks. The legislation includes capital and liquidity requirements and rules \nregarding risk diversification and emergency plans designed to maintain system-\nically relevant functions even in the event of threatened insolvency.\nTotal loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC)\xc2\xa0TLAC is a regulatory requirement \ndesigned to ensure that Global Systemically Important Banks (G-SIBs) have the \nloss-absorbing and recapitalization capacity so that, in an immediately following \nresolution, critical functions can continue without requiring taxpayer support or \nthreatening financial stability.\nTotal return swap (TRS)\xc2\xa0A TRS is a swap agreement in which one party \nmakes payments based on a set rate, either fixed or variable, while the other \nparty makes payments based on the return of an underlying asset, which \nincludes both the income it generates and any capital gains. In total return \nswaps, the underlying asset, referred to as the reference asset, is usually an \nequity index, loans or bonds.\n\nU \nUltra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWI)\xc2\xa0Ultra-high-net-worth individu-\nals have assets under management in excess of CHF 50 million or total wealth \nexceeding CHF 250 million.\n\nV \nValue-at-risk (VaR)\xc2\xa0VaR is a technique used to measure the potential loss in \nfair value of financial instruments based on a statistical analysis of historical \nprice trends and volatilities. VaR as a concept is applicable for all financial risk \ntypes with adequate price histories; the use of VaR allows the comparison of \nrisk across different businesses.\n\nR (continued) \nReverse repurchase agreements\xc2\xa0Reverse repurchase agreements are pur-\nchases of securities under agreements to resell substantially identical securities. \nThese transactions normally do not constitute economic sales and are therefore \ntreated as collateralized financing transactions and are carried in the balance \nsheet at the amount of cash received (liability) and cash disbursed (asset), \nrespectively.\nRisk management VaR\xc2\xa0Risk management VaR is a version of VaR that uses \nan exponential weighting technique that automatically adjusts VaR where recent \nshort-term market volatility differs from long-term volatility in the two-year \ndataset. Risk management VaR uses an expected shortfall calculation based \non average losses, and a one-day holding period. This results in a more respon-\nsive VaR model, as the overall changes in market volatility are reflected almost \nimmediately in the risk management VaR model.\nRisk mitigation\xc2\xa0Risk mitigation refers to measures undertaken by the Group \nor the Bank to actively manage its risk exposure. For credit risk exposure, such \nmeasures would normally include utilizing credit hedges and collateral, such as \ncash and marketable securities. Credit hedges represent the notional exposure \nthat can be transferred to other market counterparties, generally through the \nuse of credit default swaps. In addition, risk mitigation also includes the active \nmanagement of a loan portfolio by selling or sub-participating positions.\nRisk not in VaR (RNIV)\xc2\xa0RNIV is a framework intended to ensure that capital \nis held to meet all risks which are not captured, or not captured adequately, by \nthe Group\xe2\x80\x99s VaR and stressed VaR models. These include, but are not limited to \nincomplete, missing and/or illiquid risk factors such as certain basis, correlation, \nhigher-order and cross risks, and calibration parameters. The RNIV framework \nis continuously updated to incorporate new RNIVs.\nRisk-weighted assets (RWA)\xc2\xa0The value of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s assets weighted \naccording to certain identified risks for compliance with regulatory provisions.\n\nS \nStressed VaR\xc2\xa0Stressed VaR replicates a VaR calculation on the current portfo-\nlio of the Group or the Bank, taking into account a one-year observation period \nrelating to significant financial stress; it helps reduce the pro-cyclicality of the \nminimum capital requirements for market risk.\nSwiss Financial Supervisory Authority FINMA (FINMA)\xc2\xa0FINMA, as an inde-\npendent supervisory authority, protects creditors, investors and policy holders, \nensuring the smooth functioning of the financial markets and preserving their \nreputation. In its role as state supervisory authority, FINMA acts as an oversight \nauthority of banks, insurance companies, exchanges, securities dealers, collec-\ntive investment schemes, distributors and insurance intermediaries.
