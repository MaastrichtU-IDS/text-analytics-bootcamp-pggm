The key countries in which ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO operates \n\xe2\x80\x93 Belgium, France, Germany, the United States\xc2\xa0and the \nNetherlands \xe2\x80\x93 all experienced continued growth. Once again, \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s home market outperformed its European \ncounterparts as the Dutch economy expanded by 2.5%.\n\nContinued broad-based growth\nThe increase in activity in the Netherlands was broad-\nbased, with household consumption, government \nspending, investments and exports all contributing to \ngrowth. Consumption advanced on the back of a positive \nlabour market and developments in the housing market. \nThe number of jobs rose, while unemployment fell to \na\xc2\xa0historic low. Although the government decided to \nincrease spending, supply constraints meant it was \nunable\xc2\xa0to meet all its intended expenditure commitments. \nBusinesses experienced strong demand, and a lack of \nproduction capacity induced them to step up investments. \nMeanwhile, housing investments started to flatten after \nyears of acceleration. The external sector benefited from \nrelatively high growth in world trade on the back of strong \ninternational demand.\n\nGlobal trade under pressure\nVarious signs point to global expansion having reached its \npeak in 2018, with the clearest sign of a slowdown being \nthe persistent fall in confidence indicators. During the \nyear, growth in world trade, industrial production and \nglobal GDP all weakened. This was partly for cyclical \nreasons as pent-up demand waned and the inventory \ncycle started running out of steam. In addition, inflation \nrose in response to higher energy prices and held back \nthe\xc2\xa0increase in consumer purchasing power. The threat \nof\xc2\xa0protectionism also contributed to the declining \nconfidence, while the political uncertainty created by \nBrexit and concerns about the Italian budget impacted \n\nsentiment. Business surveys meanwhile showed a \nsubstantial drop in export orders. Moreover, restrictive \nmeasures by Chinese policymakers aimed at deleveraging \nthe economy reduced GDP growth in China, while \nthe\xc2\xa0rate\xc2\xa0hikes and shortening of the balance sheet by \nthe\xc2\xa0Federal Reserve also resulted in tighter financial \nconditions in many other countries.\n\nECB preparing for QE withdrawal\nOn the back of higher commodity prices, headline inflation \nrose towards the ECB\xe2\x80\x99s 2% target, while core inflation, \nwhich disregards volatile price components, remained \nmuch lower. Technological change, growing international \ncompetition and a more flexible labour market continued \nto hold back price rises. However, the ECB repeatedly \nstated that it expects core inflation to rise, with ongoing \neconomic growth and a further improvement in the labour \nmarket propping up the pressure on prices. Given this \nprospect, the ECB gradually reduced the degree of policy \naccommodation. Its first step was to reduce its monthly \nasset purchases, while the second step was to announce \nplans to cease purchases completely by the end of 2018 \nand then raise the deposit rate. Credit spreads materially \nwidened in 2018, but came down again when signals \nof\xc2\xa0a\xc2\xa0slowing economy became more clear and the ECB \nnotified markets it was about to inject more liquidity into \nthe European banking system and would not raise official \nrates before 2020. \n\nRapidly rising house prices\nAfter reaching a historic high in 2017, Dutch housing \ntransaction volume started declining in 2018. While \nthe\xc2\xa0deceleration was initially confined to the Randstad \nconurbation, it later also became visible in other parts of \nthe country. The decline was primarily caused by a lack of \nproperties for sale. In response to this shortage, but also \nbecause of strong economic growth, the favourable labour \n\nDutch economic growth continues \nto outperform key countries\n(% year-on-year 2018 \xef\xac\x81gures average over \xef\xac\x81rst three quarters)\n\nInternational environment becomes less favourable\n(index, % year-on-year)\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\n2\n\n1\n\nNetherlands\n\n2018\n\nUSA\n\nSource: Thomson Reuters Datastream.\n\n55\n\n53\n\n51\n\n49\n\n47\n\n45\n\n2017\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\n15\n\n12\n\n9\n\n6\n\n3\n\n0\n\nFrance\n\nGermany\n\nBelgium\n\nPMI World export orders (lhs, index)\n\nWorld trade (rhs, % year-on-year)\n\n  \n  \n\n  \n  \n\nSource: Thomson Reuters Datastream.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionRisk, funding & capitalLeadership structureGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherStrategy and performance\x0cStrategy and performance  /  Economic environment\n\n7\n\nmarket, low mortgage interest rates and demand from \nbuy-to-let investors, nominal house prices rose beyond \ntheir pre-crisis levels. However, regional differences are \nsubstantial. Moreover, the construction of new homes \nis\xc2\xa0continuing to fall well short of demand. Dutch \nhousebuilders\xe2\x80\x99 slow response to market changes is a   \nlong-standing problem, which the government is trying \nto\xc2\xa0address. The problem will however take a long time \nto\xc2\xa0resolve, given the limited number of building permits. \nThe fact that buyers are struggling to find suitable homes \nis taking its toll on sentiment in the housing market, \nwhich\xc2\xa0is still positive, albeit less buoyant than before.\n\nMarginal growth in lending\nDespite the decline in housing transactions, mortgage \nproduction in the Netherlands continued to increase. \nA\xc2\xa0large share of mortgage production was attributable \nto\xc2\xa0refinancing by homeowners seeking to lock into low \nmortgage interest rates. At the same time, many other \npeople redeemed all or part of their mortgage to reduce \ndebt. As a result, the total amount of outstanding mortgage \ndebt rose only moderately, and even shrank as a percentage \nof GDP. Thanks to the sharp increase in house prices and \nthe rise in redemptions, the number of\xc2\xa0households in \nnegative equity declined substantially during the year. \nLending to non-financial businesses continued to decline, \nalbeit less rapidly than before. Instead of using banks, \nbusinesses are now increasingly relying on internal funds, \nequity and corporate bonds to\xc2\xa0finance their investments. \nThe low interest rate environment is inducing investors to \nexplore a wider realm\xc2\xa0of investment opportunities and \nincreasingly to flock to corporate bonds. As a result, direct \nfinancing options have become more accessible, \nparticularly for larger businesses.\n\nWeaker growth outlook\nWe expect the US growth momentum to wane, mainly \ndriven by the slowdown in investments, which have been \nvery strong in the past two years. While US government \nspending will pick up some of the slack, this will come \nto\xc2\xa0an end in 2019. Although the rivalry between the US \nand China is likely to persist, we do not expect China \nto\xc2\xa0experience a hard landing as the government is taking \noffsetting measures to ensure the country\xe2\x80\x99s economic \nslowdown is of a more gradual nature. Weakened \nconfidence and less supportive financial conditions will \naffect activity in the eurozone. However, the European \neconomy still has some slack. Since the upward effect \nof\xc2\xa0oil prices will be only temporary, the rise in inflation \nis\xc2\xa0likely to be slow. The overall contribution of external \ndemand will become less supportive for the Netherlands, \nalthough domestic spending will continue to grow \nrobustly. Dutch GDP growth will also receive a boost \nfrom\xc2\xa0the increase in public spending that was agreed in \nthe Coalition Agreement. As capacity constraints meant \nthe government had to postpone some of its intended \nspending in 2018, some of the positive effects of this \non\xc2\xa0GDP growth will roll over to 2019.\n\nRise in in\xef\xac\x82ation won\xe2\x80\x99t worry the ECB too much\n(% year-on-year, percentage)\n\n2.5\n\n2.0\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nHarmonised in\xef\xac\x82ation (% year-on-year)\n10 year Dutch government bond yield\n\nSource: Thomson Reuters Datastream.\n\nHousing transactions have peaked\n(% year-on-year, thousands on a yearly basis)\n\n10\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nHouse prices (lhs, % year-on-year)\nTransactions (rhs, thousands on a yearly basis)\n\nSource: Thomson Reuters Datastream.\n\nLoan portfolio remains stable\n(in EUR billions, Dutch \xef\xac\x81nancial institutions\xe2\x80\x99 loan portfolio \nto Dutch non-\xef\xac\x81nancial companies and households)\n\n600\n\n480\n\n360\n\n240\n\n120\n\n0\n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nLoans to non-\xef\xac\x81nancial companies\n\nMortgages to households\n\nSource: De Nederlandsche Bank.\n\n250\n\n240\n\n230\n\n220\n\n210\n\n200\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadershipGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherStrategy and performance\x0cStrategy and performance  /  Regulatory environment\n\n8\n\nRegulatory environment\n\nIntroduction\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO operates in a highly regulated sector, where \nregulations are also continually changing. The 2018 financial \nyear saw over 30 significant regulatory developments that \nwere either new or required substantial implementation \nefforts from ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO. Some of the key developments \nduring the year are highlighted below.\n\nSustainability developments in financial legislation\nOn 8 March 2018 the European Commission unveiled \nits\xc2\xa0Action Plan on sustainable finance. This was followed \non 24 May 2018 by the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s presentation of \na\xc2\xa0package of measures that included three proposals \naimed\xc2\xa0at:\n \xc3\x85 establishing a unified EU classification system of \nsustainable economic activities (i.e. a \xe2\x80\x98taxonomy\xe2\x80\x99);\n\n \xc3\x85 improving the disclosure requirements on how \ninstitutional investors integrate environmental, \nsocial\xc2\xa0and governance (ESG) factors into their \nrisk\xc2\xa0processes; and\n\n \xc3\x85 creating a new category of benchmarks to help investors \n\ncompare the carbon footprint of their investments.\n\nIn addition, the European Commission sought feedback \non\xc2\xa0amendments to delegated acts under the Markets \nin\xc2\xa0Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) and the \nInsurance Distribution Directive (IDD), with the aim of \nincluding ESG considerations in the advice that investment \nfirms and insurance distributors offer to individual clients. \nThese amended delegated acts are expected to be \nadopted in 2019-2022.\n\nBrexit\nOn 23 June 2016 the UK voted to leave the EU. Brexit \nis\xc2\xa0now scheduled for 29 March 2019. Planning for Brexit, \nhowever, has been difficult against the uncertain political \nand regulatory backdrop. This has been primarily because \nof the drawn-out negotiations for a withdrawal agreement, \nwhich have been affecting the entire financial market. \nThe\xc2\xa0transition deal agreed between the UK and the EU in \nearly 2018, which is intended to last until the end of 2020, \nprovides for a smooth transition and legal continuity after \nBrexit on 29 March 2019. However, this transition period \nis inextricably linked to the withdrawal agreement; \nwithout\xc2\xa0the latter, there will be no post-Brexit transition. \nAnd although the UK and the EU reached such agreement \nin November 2018, uncertainties remain about whether \nthis withdrawal agreement will survive.  \n \n\nWithout a withdrawal agreement, EU financial \nservices\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0passporting rights will cease to apply after \nBrexit, and appropriate local authorisations will then \nbe\xc2\xa0needed by parties wanting to conduct business. \nThe\xc2\xa0UK\xc2\xa0government has announced that, if necessary, \nit\xc2\xa0will introduce a temporary permissions regime for \ninbound passporting of European Economic Area (EEA) \nfirms and\xc2\xa0funds. This will provide a backstop in the \nabsence of\xc2\xa0a\xc2\xa0bilaterally agreed transition period and if \nthe\xc2\xa0EU passporting regime falls away. An area of particular \nconcern has been the continuing uncertainty about access \nto UK financial market infrastructures and to London\xe2\x80\x99s \nclearing houses. Because of the many uncertainties \nand\xc2\xa0the protracted negotiations, the ECB has instructed \nbanks to prepare for a hard, \xe2\x80\x98cliff-edge\xe2\x80\x99 Brexit and to make \ncontingency plans for a \xe2\x80\x98no-deal\xe2\x80\x99 outcome.\n\nFinalisation of Basel III reforms (Basel IV)\nThe finalised Basel III standards of 7 December 2017 \n(Basel IV) imply a major change in the way banks have \nto\xc2\xa0determine their risk-weighted assets (RWAs) when \ncalculating their minimum regulatory capital. Basel IV will \nlimit the use of internal risk models to those exposure \nclasses for which more default data are available (i.e. \nretail, small corporate and specialised lending exposures). \nIn addition, a revised standardised approach for calculating \ncredit risk and operational risk, a revised credit valuation \nadjustment (CVA) risk framework and a revised leverage \nratio framework are being introduced. Lastly, where \ncapital requirements are calculated on the basis of internal \nmodels, an output floor has been set at 72.5% of the \noutcome of the calculation based on standardised \napproaches. This output floor means that institutions \nbasing their calculations on internal models will be \nrequired also to apply the revised standardised approaches \nwhen calculating their RWAs. Basel IV is due to be \ntransposed into EU law in the Capital Requirements \nDirective (CRD) and the Capital Requirements Regulation \n(CRR) and will enter into force during a transition period \nfrom 2022 onwards.\n\nReforms of Interbank Offered Rates\nInterbank Offered Rates (IBORs) are broadly used in \nfinancial markets as benchmark interest rates for\xc2\xa0a wide \nrange of products, including derivatives, deposits and \nmortgages. As the existing IBORs are increasingly likely \nto\xc2\xa0disappear over the coming years, financial market \nparticipants need to prepare for their replacements. \nAlthough no clear view has yet been formed on the \ncomposition of any new benchmark interest rates and \nthe\xc2\xa0dates on which they can start to be used, the first \nIBOR-related reforms may start taking effect in 2019. \n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionRisk, funding & capitalLeadership structureGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherStrategy and performance\x0cStrategy and performance  /  Regulatory environment\n\n9\n\nGeneral Data Protection Regulation\nThe EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) \nbecame effective on 25 May 2018 in replacement of the \nEU Data Protection Directive. The existing Dutch Data \nProtection Act (Wet bescherming persoonsgegevens) \nwas\xc2\xa0consequently repealed, while the powers of the \nDutch Data Protection Authority were expanded to include \nsuch things as\xc2\xa0the right to impose administrative fines. \nThe GDPR aims to reinforce the data protection rights of \nindividuals and to facilitate the free flow of personal data \nin the digital single market. Its requirements are stricter \nthan those that applied under the Data Protection Directive.\n\nPayment Services Directive II\nA key objective of the EU Payment Services Directive II \n(PSD II) is to create a level playing field for all payment \nservice providers, both incumbents and new entrants. \nUnder PSD II, third parties may obtain access to details \nof\xc2\xa0payment accounts at banks and so start offering \npayment initiation and account information services. \nTherefore, going forward, these parties may play a larger \nrole in the\xc2\xa0payment system.

Excluding the PB Asia \ndivestment and incidentals recorded in both years, \nother\xc2\xa0operating income decreased due to lower hedge \naccounting-related income, including the effects of the \npartial sale of the Public Sector Loan (PSL) portfolio \n(EUR\xc2\xa079\xc2\xa0million versus EUR\xc2\xa0181\xc2\xa0million in 2017), \nadverse\xc2\xa0results for CVA/DVA/FVA (EUR\xc2\xa03\xc2\xa0million negative \nversus EUR\xc2\xa075\xc2\xa0million in 2017) and a less favourable \nequity stake revaluation in 2018 mainly in Commercial \nBanking. This\xc2\xa0decrease was largely offset by better \nresults\xc2\xa0for equity participations\xc2\xa0(2018: EUR\xc2\xa0274\xc2\xa0million; \n2017:\xc2\xa0EUR\xc2\xa0114\xc2\xa0million).\n\nPersonnel expenses\xc2\xa0decreased by EUR\xc2\xa0149\xc2\xa0million in \n2018\xc2\xa0to\xc2\xa0EUR\xc2\xa02,441\xc2\xa0million. Part of this decrease was \nattributable to lower restructuring provisions in 2018 \n(EUR\xc2\xa0129\xc2\xa0million versus EUR\xc2\xa0156\xc2\xa0million in 2017). \nIf\xc2\xa0adjusted for restructuring provisions, personnel \nexpenses are on a declining trend. This reflects the lower \nFTE levels resulting from\xc2\xa0the continued progress being \nachieved by cost-saving programmes. However, this \nprogress was partly offset in 2018 by wage inflation as \nthe\xc2\xa0new Collective Labour Agreement provided for a 2% \nincrease in salaries from 1 January 2018 and for a one-off \npayment of EUR\xc2\xa016\xc2\xa0million in 2018.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionRisk, funding & capitalLeadership structureGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherStrategy and performance\x0cStrategy and performance  /  Group performance  /  Financial review\n\n15\n\nOther expenses\xc2\xa0decreased by EUR\xc2\xa082\xc2\xa0million in 2018 \nto\xc2\xa0EUR\xc2\xa02,910\xc2\xa0million. This was largely due to lower \nincidentals, partly offset by higher regulatory levies. \nExcluding the incidentals and higher regulatory levies, \nother expenses fell as a result of cost-saving programmes. \nThe effects of these cost-saving programmes were partly \noffset, however, by higher costs incurred for the external \nstaff hired to increase our short-term capacity for regulatory \nprojects. Regulatory levies increased by EUR\xc2\xa036\xc2\xa0million to \nEUR\xc2\xa0336\xc2\xa0million, mainly due to a higher Single Resolution \nFund contribution.\n\nImpairment charges on financial instruments amounted to \nEUR\xc2\xa0655\xc2\xa0million in 2018, compared with a release of \nEUR\xc2\xa063\xc2\xa0million in 2017. Despite the continued favourable \ntrend in overall credit quality and the positive \nmacroeconomic environment, impairment charges rose \nin\xc2\xa02018, mainly in CIB and Commercial Banking, reflecting \nadditional impairment charges in energy (mainly offshore), \nshipping, commodities, diamonds and healthcare. \nImpairment releases in 2017 benefited from model \nrefinements and a model update. The cost of risk \namounted to 24bps in 2018, which was below the \nthrough-the-cycle level of 25-30bps.\n\nBalance sheet\nCondensed statement of financial position\n\n(in\xc2\xa0millions)\n\nCash and balances at central banks\nFinancial assets held for trading\nDerivatives\nFinancial investments\nSecurities financing1\nLoans and advances banks\nLoans and advances customers\nOther1\nTotal assets\nFinancial liabilities held for trading\nDerivatives\nSecurities financing1\nDue to banks\nDue to customers\nIssued debt\nSubordinated liabilities\nOther1\nTotal liabilities\nEquity attributable to the owners of the parent company\nAT1 capital securities\nEquity attributable to other non-controlling interests\nTotal equity\nTotal liabilities and equity\nCommitted credit facilities\nGuarantees and other commitments\n\n31 December 2018\n\n31 December 2017\n\n34,371\n495\n6,191\n42,184\n12,375\n8,124\n270,886\n6,668\n381,295\n253\n7,159\n7,407\n13,437\n236,123\n80,784\n9,805\n4,968\n359,935\n19,349\n2,008\n2\n21,360\n381,295\n61,166\n15,241\n\n29,783\n1,600\n9,825\n40,964\n15,686\n10,665\n274,906\n9,743\n393,171\n1,082\n8,367\n11,412\n16,462\n236,699\n76,612\n9,720\n11,488\n371,841\n19,303\n2,007\n20\n21,330\n393,171\n55,295\n16,165\n\n1  ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO classified all unsettled securities transactions as other assets and other liabilities, previously these were included in securities financing.

We therefore offer \nour\xc2\xa0people a\xc2\xa0highly valued, integrated and relevant \nemployee experience in a purpose-led and values-driven \nculture. We\xc2\xa0believe in an open corporate culture in which \nemployees have a say and are encouraged to help build \nthe organisation. In October 2018, we conducted our \nlatest global Employee Engagement Survey (EES). With \n18,510 people (internal and external staff) completing \nthe\xc2\xa0survey, the response rate was 78%, making the \nresults representative. Our engagement index score \nrose\xc2\xa0from 79\xc2\xa0to 80. This is on-target (80) and comparable \nto the Global Financial Services norm of 81 in 2019.\n\nTalent and development\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO aims to create long-term value for its clients, \nemployees and investors, as well as for society as a \nwhole. Attracting new talents and investing in employee \ndevelopment is a prerequisite for creating long-term value. \nThese investments come in the form of formal training, \nsupervision, coaching, on-the-job learning and mandatory \ntraining to develop our professional knowledge. We have \nmodified our performance management system in order \nto give employees a greater sense of ownership of the \nrole that their personal and professional development play \nin contributing to our strategy. The new system focuses \non having the right type of dialogue and on creating \na\xc2\xa0feedback culture.\n\nInvestment and appreciation\nIn 2018 we made significant investments in employer \nbranding and talent sourcing and in optimising our journey \nto attract talent. We are also continuing to invest in \nemployee training and development in order to accelerate \nskill building. These investments account for around 1.8% \nof our overall personnel costs. \n \nWe measure the extent to which staff appreciate Talent \nand Development opportunities in our annual Employee \nEngagement Survey. Overall satisfaction with Talent \nand\xc2\xa0Development stood at 78% in 2018, which was \n3\xc2\xa0percentage points higher than that of our industry peers. \n\nTransformation\nThe transformation team was formed in mid-2017 to design, \naccelerate and support the bank-wide transformation in \ncooperation with HR. Over the past year, our transformation \nefforts focused primarily on further aligning our strategic \nambitions and corporate culture with the bank\xe2\x80\x99s purpose \nof \xe2\x80\x9cBanking for better, for generations to come\xe2\x80\x9d. These \ntransformation efforts now serve as a\xc2\xa0clear imperative \nand\xc2\xa0as a framework for the bank\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing transformation \ninto a purpose-led business. Our\xc2\xa0executive management \nteams have worked in partnership with our transformation \nfacilitators to strengthen the teams\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0leadership capabilities \nand practices so that they can lead and manage the \ntransformation of their respective businesses and \norganisations and give our employees clear insight \ninto\xc2\xa0ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0vision and direction.\n\nDiversity and inclusion\xc2\xa0\nTo be successful, we need to have a diverse workforce \nthat reflects the communities we serve. An inclusive \nenvironment plays a pivotal role in developing an open \nculture. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to diversity and \ninclusion includes promoting equal treatment and equal \nopportunities for employees, preventing harassment \nand\xc2\xa0ensuring non-discrimination.\n\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO pursued various diversity initiatives in 2018, \nincluding externally and internally organised mentoring \nprogrammes, such as the Career Accelerator Programme, \nfor women and for employees with a bicultural background. \nWe have also set up a dedicated taskforce to accelerate \nthe advancement of our non-Western colleagues.\n\nTo further professionalise the process of hiring people \nwith a disability and also support existing colleagues with \na disability, we have set up the B-Able Desk to respond \nto\xc2\xa0questions from employees and managers and to \nprovide help in the form of coaching and practical advice. \nWe have also launched the Sign Language Coffee Bar, \nwhere colleagues order their coffee in sign language from \na\xc2\xa0hearing-impaired barista. In addition, we have boosted \nour Warm Welcome project by hiring thirty staff with an \nemployment disability in various offices throughout \nthe\xc2\xa0country.\n\nOver the years, substantial numbers of refugees have \ncome to the Netherlands and requested political asylum. \nThose allowed to stay are called status holders.

Unacceptable risks lead to a client exit or, in the \ncase of prospective clients or third parties, to rejection.\n\nIn July 2018 we were one of the first companies in \nthe\xc2\xa0Netherlands to sign the \xe2\x80\x98Talent to the Top\xe2\x80\x99 Cultural \nDiversity Charter. By doing so, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO committed \nitself to a concrete and self-determined objective for \nappointing non-Western talent to top and subtop positions. \nHaving set a target of 7% for non-Western staff in subtop \npositions and 6% in top positions by 2020, we\xc2\xa0were able \nin 2018 to achieve a 4.4% share for subtop positions and \n3.4% for top positions. We have also set up a series of \nDiversity Circles and the Diversity Table to further engage \nour network.\n\nThe 2018 LGBT+ survey showed a positive tendency in \nattitudes within the bank. Most of our employees have \na\xc2\xa0positive stance on LGBT+ colleagues. The bank has \nalso\xc2\xa0signed the UN standards of conduct supporting \nthe\xc2\xa0business community in tackling discrimination against \nLGBT+ people and the Sustainable Development Goals \nin\xc2\xa0the LGBTI Manifesto (SDG LGBTI).\n\nDetecting\xc2\xa0financial crime\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO acknowledges the importance of its role \nas\xc2\xa0a\xc2\xa0gatekeeper in safeguarding the financial system \nagainst financial crime. It therefore focuses on seeking to \ncontinually improve its procedures, systems and controls \nin order to reflect our beliefs and live up to our regulatory \nand societal obligations and expectations, to minimise \nthe\xc2\xa0risk of being involved in or associated with money \nlaundering, the financing of terrorism, bribery, corruption \nand tax evasion and to comply with economic sanctions.\n\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO has programmes in place to bolster its \nresilience to financial crime and unethical and illegal \nbehaviour and to strengthen its governance regarding \nthe\xc2\xa0detecting of financial crime.\n\nClient and third-party integrity\nBoth before entering into and during business relationships, \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO carries out due diligence on its\xc2\xa0prospective \nclients and third parties such as agents, intermediaries \nand suppliers. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO does this, using a risk-based \napproach, to minimise the risk of being involved in \nor\xc2\xa0associated with money laundering, the financing \nof\xc2\xa0terrorism, bribery, corruption or tax evasion.\xc2\xa0\n\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO systematically monitors the activities of its \nclients and reports any suspicious or unusual transactions \nto the relevant authorities. In high-risk situations (such as \nthose involving politically exposed persons or adverse \nmedia, or clients in countries or sectors with an inherently \nhigher risk of financial crime), prospective and existing \nclients undergo additional due diligence. The bank also \nconsiders geopolitical factors when assessing the risks \n\nThe\xc2\xa0Q4 2018 figures included a provision of EUR\xc2\xa085\xc2\xa0million \nin\xc2\xa0Retail\xc2\xa0Banking (ICS) and Commercial Banking for \nadditional costs of accelerating\xc2\xa0Customer Due\xc2\xa0Diligence \n(CDD) remediation programmes. See note 29 Provisions \nof\xc2\xa0the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements for \nfurther\xc2\xa0information.\n\nCombating bribery and corruption\nCorruption undermines fair and competitive business, \nrestricts international trade, reduces investor confidence, \nand impacts on regional and global economic growth \nand\xc2\xa0international stability.\n\nIn addition to the risks posed to the financial system, \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO itself can also face reputational and financial \nrisks from potentially becoming directly exposed to or \nbeing abused for corrupt practices. We take these risks \nseriously and take mitigating measures to limit them.\n\nIt is our corporate social responsibility to conduct business \nwith integrity and without any form of bribery and corruption.\n\nOrganisational and employee integrity\nAll staff members undergo mandatory training to \nrecognise signs of financial crime, including \xe2\x80\x98red flags\xe2\x80\x99 \nof\xc2\xa0money laundering, bribery, corruption and conflicts \nof\xc2\xa0interest. It is ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s policy for all actual or \nsuspected incidents, irregularities or breaches relating \nto\xc2\xa0bribery and corruption to be reported immediately. \nEmployees are encouraged, where possible, to first \ndiscuss such suspicions with their manager. If this is \nundesirable for any reason, they should report their \nsuspicions through the bank\xe2\x80\x99s whistleblowing channels, \nwhich are also open to external parties.\n\nIn accordance with regulatory requirements, we monitor \nthe risks of money laundering, the financing of terrorism, \nbribery and corruption in our organisation so as to maintain \na strong control system and to mitigate the risks. The risks \nof money laundering, the financing of terrorism, bribery \nand corruption are assessed as part of our Systematic \nIntegrity Risk Analysis (SIRA), which is based on qualitative \nand quantitative information and creates awareness \nof\xc2\xa0the\xc2\xa0inherent and residual integrity risks faced by \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO. In addition to the SIRA, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO \ncontinually works to\xc2\xa0create data-driven insight into \nintegrity risks. More\xc2\xa0information can be found in our   \nanti-bribery and\xc2\xa0corruption policy.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionRisk, funding & capitalLeadership structureGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherStrategy and performance\x0cStrategy and performance  /  Group performance  /  Non-financial review\n\n19\n\nResilience to security threats\nWe have an information security framework in place that \ndefines management and staff responsibilities and sets \nout security directives applying to the bank, its vendors \nand third parties with whom the bank exchanges \ninformation. The Corporate Information Security Office \n(CISO) systematically monitors client transactions in order \nto detect fraudulent transactions. Security and Integrity \nManagement (SIM) monitors and reports the number \nof\xc2\xa0detected issues relating to fraud, information security \nand\xc2\xa0compliance breaches, while also monitoring losses \nsuffered by the bank\xe2\x80\x99s clients and the bank itself. In \naddition, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO has a security framework in place \nto\xc2\xa0manage the risk of, and prevent, financial crime and \nunethical behaviour. Before introducing new products \nand\xc2\xa0services, the bank uses Change Risk Assessments \n(CRA) to assess the potential risks related to these \nproducts and\xc2\xa0services, including the possibility of fraud.\n\nThe bank is focused on raising awareness among clients \nand employees of how to recognise and prevent financial \nand economic crime. The bank cooperates with other \nbanks, as well as with the police and justice departments, \nto shield financial transactions from potential criminals.\n\nCybercrime\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s information infrastructures connect the \nbank\xe2\x80\x99s networks to public networks. As a result, banking \nprocesses and their supporting information systems \nare\xc2\xa0inherently vulnerable. This vulnerability threatens \nthe\xc2\xa0security and availability of client data and services. \nThe\xc2\xa0bank faces a constant threat of cybercrime, including \ncomputer-assisted fraud, unauthorised disclosure of \nconfidential information, virus infections, computer \nhacking and denial of service attacks.\xc2\xa0\n\nIn the first quarter of 2018, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO experienced \nmultiple Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks via \na\xc2\xa0relatively new method. Most of these attacks were \nsuccessfully mitigated and\xc2\xa0had minimal impact on clients \nand employees. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO filed several police reports \nand is actively sharing information with the police and \nother banks, through the Electronic Crimes Task Force, \nto\xc2\xa0support the ongoing police investigations.\n\nWe have established a structured approach to information \nsecurity in recognition of the importance of protecting \nthe\xc2\xa0information and associated assets, such as systems \nand infrastructures, of our clients and of the bank. \nThis\xc2\xa0is\xc2\xa0designed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity \nand\xc2\xa0availability of information at all times. This approach \ndefines the organisational framework, the management \nand staff responsibilities, and the information security \ndirectives applying to the bank, its vendors and third \nparties with whom the bank exchanges information. \nAs\xc2\xa0part of this approach, the bank continuously monitors \ncybercrime threats and adapts the bank\xe2\x80\x99s defences \nwherever necessary. \n\nResponsible tax\xc2\xa0\nIt is our corporate social responsibility to pay our \nshare\xc2\xa0of\xc2\xa0tax. We communicate on our tax approach \ntransparently\xc2\xa0and publish our tax principles on the \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xc2\xa0website. Our tax principles illustrate \nhow\xc2\xa0we\xc2\xa0fulfil our\xc2\xa0social responsibility relating to tax. \nOur\xc2\xa0tax policy is based\xc2\xa0on these principles and \nprovides\xc2\xa0guidance on what\xc2\xa0we believe is responsible \ntax\xc2\xa0behaviour for the whole\xc2\xa0ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group, both \nregarding our own affairs and in our dealings with clients.\n\nActions to improve tax control in 2018\nIn 2018 we implemented further measures to increase \nour\xc2\xa0management of tax risks. Tax is part of our Risk \nManagement Cycle. Tax evasion and tax integrity are \nboth\xc2\xa0part of our Systematic Integrity Risk Analysis (SIRA), \nwhich supports our risk-based approach to all integrity \nrisks, including tax risks. Tax was also a risk theme during \n2018 and will continue to be so in 2019. Group Tax is \ninvolved in all relevant risk and control self-assessments. \nTax risks are assessed in conjunction with the businesses \nwhere these arise. Any key tax risks identified are \nmonitored and the controls in place are tested.\xc2\xa0\n\nTax embedded in client and product approval procedures\nOur client acceptance and review procedures\xc2\xa0include \na\xc2\xa0review of potential tax evasion \xe2\x80\x93 which is never \nacceptable \xe2\x80\x93 and also review clients from a tax integrity \nperspective.\xc2\xa0Group Tax supports relationship managers \nin\xc2\xa0assessing clients\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0tax positions and in defining \nappropriate\xc2\xa0actions. We consult and discuss tax integrity \nwith relevant clients. As well as the tax awareness \nsessions that Group Tax continued arranging for client-\nfacing staff in 2018, we have also included questions \non\xc2\xa0tax in our standard training programmes for all staff.\n\nAs we wish to steer clear of aggressive tax planning \nand\xc2\xa0tax avoidance, our intention is to offer products that \ncomply with the intention and spirit of the law and that \nare\xc2\xa0commercial rather than tax-driven.

This has been the subject of discussions between \nABN AMRO and the German tax authorities for the \npast\xc2\xa0years. Currently, there are no disputes between \nthe\xc2\xa0German tax authorities and ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO relating to \nthese transactions. Since 2010, a\xc2\xa0number of subsidiaries \nassociated with these transactions have been sold by \nmeans of a management buy-out and the desks of \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO that were (directly or indirectly) involved in \nthese trading strategies have been closed. That\xc2\xa0does not \nmean, however, that there are no legal risks remaining \nwith regard to these transactions in particular civil and/or \ncriminal law risks.\n\nIn the second half of 2018 public reports appeared on the \ninvolvement of subsidiaries of ABN AMRO or former Fortis \nin dividend stripping activities and particularly in so-called \ncum-ex activities in the past. This has raised questions \nin\xc2\xa0Dutch parliament. In as far as these questions were \ndirected to ABN AMRO itself these questions have been \nanswered. The Dutch Minister of Finance has answered \nfurther questions on 3 December 2018.

We have \na proven track record in delivering products and services \nunder the ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO brand, and specific products and \nservices under other labels. Our operations provide a \nseamless omni-channel distribution network for our \nclients, with extensive digital and physical coverage.\n\nRetail Banking has a strong foundation and a recognised \nmarket position in the Netherlands. In 2018 we retained \nour strong foothold in the Dutch market and maintained \nour number three primary bank position for retail clients \n(20%\xc2\xa0of the Dutch population). ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO captured a \nnumber 2 market position in new mortgage production \nin\xc2\xa02018, with a combined market share of all ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO \nbrands in the Dutch mortgage market of approximately \n17%. Retail and Private Banking held a combined market \nshare of 21% in the savings and deposits market.\n\nWe are also continually adjusting our service model to \nbetter match the needs of our clients and to maintain \nour\xc2\xa0position for the future. We have decided to maximise \nour focus on the digital transformation in our product \nand\xc2\xa0service offering, where we are now shifting towards \na\xc2\xa0digital-first service concept and aiming to become \na\xc2\xa0frontrunner in the market.\n\nBusiness developments\nIntroduction\nThe banking sector is undergoing significant transformation. \nWe are facing societal and banking trends that are shaping \nthe context in which we operate, as well as experiencing \ncompetition from many different directions. New players \nare entering the market, while technological and regulatory \ndevelopments are changing the competitive landscape \nand traditional ways of banking. During the year we \ncontinued seeking to achieve our ambition of being at the \nforefront of digitalisation and technological developments \nso that we can deliver innovative products and solutions, \nenhance the client experience and provide relevant and \npersonal expertise. In order to continue delivering in our \nbusiness we will use the strategy refresh as a guideline, \nwith \xe2\x80\x98Banking for better\xe2\x80\x99 as the basis for embedding our \nstrategic pillars of reinventing the customer experience, \nsustainability and building a future-proof bank.\n\nSupporting our clients\xe2\x80\x99 transition to sustainability\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO is committed to the preconditions of the \nInternational Energy Agency\xe2\x80\x99s 2-degree scenario. The main \nway in which ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO can have an impact in this \nrespect is by making real estate more sustainable. \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO is therefore aiming for all our real estate, \nincluding our own offices and Retail branches, to average \n\nenergy label \xe2\x80\x98A\xe2\x80\x99 by 2030. As at 31 December 2018 we had \n104,657 \xe2\x80\x98label A\xe2\x80\x99 houses in our mortgage portfolio, \nrepresenting an increase of 23.3% on the position at the \n2017 year-end.\xc2\xa0Good progress has also been achieved in \nvarious ongoing initiatives in the mortgage market, while \nmultiple initiatives have been started in the Personal \nBanking domain to help vulnerable groups such as the \nelderly. These include making more use of financial \ncoaches and encouraging elderly people to use digital \nand\xc2\xa0video banking.\n\nRetail Banking is currently looking into opportunities to \nbroaden the scope of and prospects for sustainability. \nMultiple initiatives have already been launched as part of \nour Mission 2030, including the\xc2\xa0energy-savings check. In \naddition, we are taking steps to guide vulnerable clients \ntowards a more responsible approach to credit. During the \nyear we also worked with Green Choice to launch a new, \nsustainably-themed savings account for children.\n\nReinventing the customer experience\nRetail Banking plans to build on its success, its track \nrecord for delivery and its chosen route in the field of \ncustomer experience and digitalisation. We will position \nour digital offering, customer journey and data capabilities \nas true enablers for our products and processes, while \nseeking opportunities to broaden our role in selected \necosystems.\n\nWe added more self-service features to our Mobile \nBanking app in 2018. These additions, which are designed \nto ensure our digital offering maintains a leading position, \nincluded the launch of the chatbot Anna and iDIN mobile. \nWe also maintained our top-class ranking in the app stores \n(with scores in the Apple App store and Google Playstore \nof 4.5 and 4.4 respectively, on a scale of 1 to 5). Meanwhile, \nBanking.nl ranked our mobile banking app as the best \nDutch mobile banking app. As for our other apps, we \nexpanded the user base of Tikkie (5\xc2\xa0million+ users), GRIP \n(500,000+ users) and the &Meer loyalty programme \n(250,000+ users). The\xc2\xa0Net Promoter Score in 2018 was \n-9\xc2\xa0(2017: -9).\n\nIn 2018, we opened the first Office 3.0 in Amstelveen \n(Netherlands). This office was developed based on the \nneeds of our customers, with the central focus being on \nthe shift to digital. Examples of the new features include \nmeeting rooms that can be used for video banking, and \nthe video wall displaying information about our products.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadershipGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherStrategy and performance\x0cStrategy and performance  /  Business performance  /  Retail Banking\n\n22\n\nRetail received several awards during the year, including \nthe \xe2\x80\x98Rookie of the Year\xe2\x80\x99 award for Speech Analytics, the \nSterrenregen award for ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s car insurance, the \nDutch Consumers Association\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98Best of the Test\xe2\x80\x99 award \nfor our legal aid insurance and, for the fourth year in a row, \na\xc2\xa05-star award from MoneyView for our travel insurance. \nLast but not least, in October 2018 ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO was \nawarded the \xe2\x80\x98Gouden spreekbuis\xe2\x80\x99, a prize for excellent \nmortgage customer service.\n\nsystems, we are continuing to empower our employees \nby, for example, taking the next steps in promoting \nagile\xc2\xa0ways of working and further embedding the shift to \nself-organising.

In the Mortgage domain the comprehensive \noptimisation programme we recently completed across \nthe chain has achieved strong results. While we are \ncontinuing to further improve and digitalise our mortgage \nactivities, we are also shifting our focus to another strategic \nimportant portfolio: consumer credit. Driven by our ambition \nto remain a responsible consumer credit provider, with a \nsustainable business model, we will be optimising and \nrationalising our entire consumer credit chain over the \nnext few years. As well as optimising our core product \ngroups, including the underlying process flows and \n\nFinancial review\nFinancial highlights\n \xc3\x85 Profit for the period decreased\xc2\xa0by 15%, mainly due to \n\nlower operating income and lower impairment releases.\n\n \xc3\x85 Net interest income decreased by 3%, primarily due \n\nto the impact of a model update for non-maturing \ndeposits.

If adjusted for incidentals in \nboth periods, the decrease was mainly attributable to the \ncombined impact (of approximately EUR\xc2\xa060\xc2\xa0million) of the \nmodel update for non-maturing deposits (NMD) and the \nreallocation of net interest income from Group Functions. \nInterest income from residential mortgages remained \n\nstable as the lower average volume was offset by the \nslight improvement in margins that resulted from good \npricing discipline in a highly competitive market. Interest \nincome on consumer loans declined as a result of lower \naverage volumes and margins.

This was mainly \ndue to lower restructuring costs in 2018 (EUR\xc2\xa05\xc2\xa0million \nversus EUR\xc2\xa024\xc2\xa0million in 2017) and declining FTE levels. \nThe decrease in the latter was partly offset, however, \nby\xc2\xa0the new Collective Labour Agreement, which resulted \nin salary increases of 2% and a one-off payment of \nEUR\xc2\xa01,000 per employee. The decrease in the number \nof\xc2\xa0FTE by 615 to 4,445 as at 31 December 2018 as a \nresult of digitalisation and cost-saving programmes is also \nreflected in a further reduction in the number of branches.\n\nOther expenses\xc2\xa0increased by EUR\xc2\xa020\xc2\xa0million to \nEUR\xc2\xa01,586\xc2\xa0million (2017: EUR\xc2\xa01,566\xc2\xa0million), mainly due \n\nto the provision of EUR\xc2\xa030\xc2\xa0million recorded in ICS for \nadditional costs to accelerate customer due diligence \n(CDD) remediation programmes and to higher regulatory \nlevies (EUR\xc2\xa0169\xc2\xa0million, compared with EUR\xc2\xa0155\xc2\xa0million \nin\xc2\xa02017).

We serve approximately \n365,000 clients1 with annual turnovers of up to \nEUR\xc2\xa0250\xc2\xa0million across a wide variety of sectors. \nCommercial Banking offers a broad range of products and \nservices based on in-depth client and sector knowledge.\n\nBusiness developments\nIntroduction\nThe Commercial Banking team has continued its \njourney\xc2\xa0of meeting changing client needs. Our strategy \nis\xc2\xa0guided by client intimacy where it matters and efficiency \neverywhere else. With our sector focus we aim to be \na\xc2\xa0valuable strategic partner for our clients, resulting in \nstrong and personal client relationships. We offer our \nclients a wide range of innovative digital services to \nmeet\xc2\xa0their basic needs.\n\nSupporting our clients\xe2\x80\x99 transition to sustainability\nWe want to accelerate the sustainability shift of our \nclients. We do this through new business propositions \nand\xc2\xa0by leveraging on partners on topics such as energy \ntransition and circular transition. In 2018, we reopened \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Groenbank, a wholly owned subsidiary of \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO that provides financing for sustainable \nprojects based on the Green Scheme established by \nthe\xc2\xa0Netherlands Enterprise Agency (RVO). In addition, \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO now offers real estate owners a fast and \nconvenient way to check how their buildings measure \nup\xc2\xa0to the requirements of the sustainability label \nBREEAM-NL In-Use. BREEAM is an international \nstandard\xc2\xa0for assessing, improving and certifying the \nsustainability performance of buildings. This quick scan, \ndeveloped in cooperation with CFP Green Buildings \nand\xc2\xa0the Dutch Green Building Council, has been added \nto\xc2\xa0ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s sustainable investment tools. Lastly, \nas\xc2\xa0one\xc2\xa0of the founding partners of Social Finance NL, \na\xc2\xa0start-up issuing\xc2\xa0social impact bonds on the Dutch \nfinancial market, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO provides access to \nfinance\xc2\xa0for social entrepreneurs.\n\nReinventing the customer experience\nWe aim to provide services and products that improve \nour\xc2\xa0clients\xe2\x80\x99 businesses. We use the drivers of our \nNet\xc2\xa0Promoter Score and continually engage with our \nclients so that we can better understand their wishes \nand\xc2\xa0challenges and can support them where needed. \nAs\xc2\xa0well as improving our current processes and offerings, \n\nCommercial Banking aims to innovate and to create \nnew\xc2\xa0partnerships. One example of such initiatives is \nthe\xc2\xa0strategic partnership that ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO has agreed \nwith\xc2\xa0Opportunity Network, an online cross-border \nplatform\xc2\xa0providing entrepreneurs with insight into real-life \nopportunities for growth, acquisitions, expansion, sales \nand so on. An example of our fee-based initiatives is \nTikkie, an app for payment requests. Commercial Banking \nhas also been expanding the opportunities for business \napplications, including among the municipalities, universities \nand other organisations that are already using\xc2\xa0Tikkie. \nIn\xc2\xa02018, our Net Promoter Score increased to\xc2\xa0-2\xc2\xa0(2017: -6).\n\nBuilding a future-proof bank\nCommercial Banking has further improved its operational \nefficiency by developing simple solutions and optimising \nprocesses and documentation. SME prospects whose \ncurrent account overdraft requirement is less than \nEUR\xc2\xa0125,000 can now, for example, check whether \nthey\xc2\xa0are eligible for a loan without having to become an \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO client first. Technological developments such \nas blockchain can create opportunities for us to improve \nour existing client propositions and develop new business \nofferings. This is illustrated by the pilot we have launched \nwith the Port of Rotterdam and Samsung SDS, Samsung\xe2\x80\x99s \nlogistics and IT division. The pilot aims to use blockchain \ntechnology to build a platform for efficient and paperless \nadministration processes for international finance and \nlogistics relating to container transport. The platform should \nmake it just as easy to transport, track and finance goods \nand services as it is to order a book online.

This strength \nallows us to continually adapt to changing client needs and \nmarket developments, and to thoroughly understand the \nfinancial situation of our clients. We offer clients multi-\nchannel wealth management services that enable them \nto\xc2\xa0use our services whenever and wherever it suits them.\xc2\xa0\n\nWe are an enterprising private bank aiming to have an \nimpact on society. We support and engage our clients by \noffering forward-looking, expert advice enabling them to \nmanage their overall wealth in a risk-controlled manner \nand taking both life and business events into account.\n\nPrivate Banking targets high net worth individuals with \nmore than EUR\xc2\xa0500,000 in investable assets in the \nNetherlands or more than EUR\xc2\xa01\xc2\xa0million outside the \nNetherlands, and ultra-high net worth individuals with \nmore than EUR\xc2\xa025\xc2\xa0million in investable assets. \n\nBusiness developments\nIntroduction\nIn line with our ambition to continue to be a leading \nNorthwest\xc2\xa0European private bank, we took further steps \nduring the year\xc2\xa0to build our One Private Bank, including \ninvesting in and further integrating our activities across \nour\xc2\xa0core markets to achieve benefits of scale. Given that \nthe wealth management market is changing rapidly and \nconsolidating,\xc2\xa0scale is increasingly important if we are \nto\xc2\xa0invest in the staff and systems needed to optimise \nthe\xc2\xa0services we provide to our clients. As we saw no \nopportunities to achieve the scale required in Luxembourg \nto optimally serve our clients we concluded that it would \nbe in their best interests to transfer our Luxembourg-\nbased\xc2\xa0wealth management and insurance activities to \nBGL BNP Paribas. \n\nIn July, we announced plans to acquire Soci\xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9 G\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa9rale\xe2\x80\x99s \nprivate banking subsidiary in Belgium. This\xc2\xa0acquisition fits \nin perfectly with our strategy of consolidating our private \nbanking position in Northwest Europe. It will enable us \nto\xc2\xa0serve our clients better and continue expanding our \nBelgian activities. The acquisition was completed on \n28\xc2\xa0February 2019.\n\nSupporting our clients\xe2\x80\x99 transition to sustainability\nTo live up to our promise of \xe2\x80\x98Banking for better, for \ngenerations to come\xe2\x80\x99 and to accelerate the sustainability \nshift, we are taking responsibility for the impact that \nour\xc2\xa0products and services have on society by offering \nsustainable investment services. We choose our in-house \nmanaged sustainable products and solutions by using \na\xc2\xa0combination of positive ESG (environmental, social \n\nand\xc2\xa0governance) selection criteria. We actively engage \nwith companies that do not meet our criteria, while also \nmonitoring and seeking to improve their progress on \nengagement objectives and evaluating their results. \nIf\xc2\xa0a\xc2\xa0company does not meet the objectives that have \nbeen\xc2\xa0set, we may decide to end the relationship.\n\nOur ambition is to achieve EUR\xc2\xa016\xc2\xa0billion of sustainable \nassets by 2020. By the end of 2018 we had achieved \nEUR\xc2\xa013.9\xc2\xa0billion in support of this transition. We are \nalso\xc2\xa0introducing internal key performance indicators (KPIs) \nto monitor progress.\xc2\xa0We have designed an education \nprogramme on sustainability, with over 500 people \nparticipating in our online e-learning seminars on ESG and \nsustainable investment. We have also signed an academic \npartnership with Oxford University on sustainable \ninvestment and asset management, and sponsor social \nentrepreneurship chairs at the Erasmus University \nRotterdam and the University of Utrecht.\n\nIn the course of 2018, we started to offer the sustainable \ninvestment option as the default option for new clients in \nthe Netherlands. The majority of new Discretionary \nPortfolio Management (DPM) clients in the Netherlands \nnow chooses the sustainable investment option.\n\nReinventing the customer experience\nOur strategy includes the ambition to offer our clients \nopen architecture solutions. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Investment \nSolutions (AAIS) has accordingly completed the sale \nof\xc2\xa0its\xc2\xa0direct investment business and can now focus on \noffering a \xe2\x80\x98pure\xe2\x80\x99 open architecture and creating further \nopportunities for growth across the private bank.\n\nThroughout the year we continued working to deliver \nproducts and services that fit our clients\xe2\x80\x99 needs. In July, \nwe launched our customised advice service, which \nprovides ideas for strategic, tactical, thematic and \nsustainable investments to experienced and committed \nclients with assets under management of at least \nEUR\xc2\xa02.5\xc2\xa0million. In the Netherlands we introduced an \ninvestment theme app in the second quarter of the year, \naimed at execution only clients. The themes covered in \nthis app include sustainable energy, sustainable investing, \nconnected world, healthcare technology, biotechnology, \nemerging markets and water. To address the appetite for \nalternative investments in portfolios, we launched our \nCarlyle private equity product for clients in Germany, \nFrance and the Netherlands. During the year we hosted \nmany events to update clients on developments in the \nmarket. In Berlin, for example, we hosted a client event \nfor large investors interested in meeting start-ups and \nincubators, while in the Netherlands we introduced video \nbanking so that we can have live discussions with clients \nwhenever and wherever they want.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionRisk, funding & capitalLeadership structureGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherStrategy and performance\x0cStrategy and performance  /  Business performance  /  Private Banking\n\n27\n\nOur efforts to deliver products and services fitting our \nclients\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0needs are being recognised in the market, as \nexemplified by various awards, such as the WealthBriefing \nAward for the best domestic clients team among private \nbanks in Europe. Nevertheless, our Net Promoter \nScore\xc2\xa0went down to -1, which underpins the need to \ncontinuously focus on clients\xe2\x80\x99 demands and needs.\n\nBuilding a future-proof bank\nIn 2017 we initiated organisation-wide functional management \nin order to harmonise platforms, processes and product offer-\nings across locations, to accelerate the introduction of digital \nsolutions, and to leverage knowledge and activities across \n geographies. We have now completed the reorganisation \nin\xc2\xa0the Netherlands and are making good progress in France \nand Germany. While change naturally impacts on staff, we \nhave found that our strategy to harmonise, digitalise and grow \nis resonating well with our employees. As a result, the annual \n\nemployee engagement score increased from 72% (2017) \nto\xc2\xa075% (2018) across Private Banking, with client focus \nand\xc2\xa0 sustainability being seen as key strengths. The strategic \n direction chosen by the bank to accelerate the sustainability \nshift is also fully endorsed by Private Banking staff. \n\nFinancial review\nFinancial highlights\n \xc3\x85 Excluding PB Asia results, net interest income rose \n\nby\xc2\xa012% on the back of margin improvements, whereas \nnet fee and commission income decreased by 9% \nowing to\xc2\xa0less favourable market sentiment.\n\n \xc3\x85 Personnel expenses decreased owing to the FTE \nreductions resulting from the\xc2\xa0PB Asia and Private \nBanking\xc2\xa0Luxembourg divestments and restructuring \nprogrammes.\n\n \xc3\x85 Client assets decreased owing to a negative market \n\nperformance and some custody outflows.\n\nOperating results\n\n(in\xc2\xa0millions)\n\nNet interest income\nNet fee and commission income\nOther operating income\nOperating income\nPersonnel expenses\nOther expenses\nOperating expenses\nOperating result\nImpairment charges on financial instruments\nOperating profit/(loss) before taxation\nIncome tax expense\nProfit/(loss) for the period\n\n2018\n\n719\n509\n111\n1,340\n390\n539\n929\n411\n3\n408\n95\n312\n\n2017\n\n659\n573\n307\n1,540\n472\n624\n1,095\n444\n-6\n450\n64\n386\n\nChange\n\n9%\n-11%\n-64%\n-13%\n-17%\n-14%\n-15%\n-7%\n\n-9%\n48%\n-19%\n\nPrivate Banking\xe2\x80\x99s profit for 2018 amounted to \nEUR\xc2\xa0312\xc2\xa0million (2017: EUR\xc2\xa0386\xc2\xa0million). Excluding \nPB\xc2\xa0Asia results, profit increased by EUR\xc2\xa0100\xc2\xa0million \nbecause of higher income resulting from favourable \nincidentals (sale proceeds and provision releases from \ndivestments) and lower costs. \n\nNet interest income\xc2\xa0rose by EUR\xc2\xa060\xc2\xa0million to \nEUR\xc2\xa0719\xc2\xa0million (2017: EUR\xc2\xa0659\xc2\xa0million). Excluding \nthe\xc2\xa0contribution of PB Asia, net interest income rose \nby\xc2\xa0EUR\xc2\xa079\xc2\xa0million. This increase was mainly due to \nmargin\xc2\xa0improvements, which were partly offset by \nthe\xc2\xa0combined impact of the NMD model update and \nthe\xc2\xa0reallocation of the net interest income with Group \nFunctions that negatively impacted on net interest \nincome\xc2\xa0by EUR\xc2\xa020\xc2\xa0million.

Excluding the \ncontribution of PB Asia, net fee and commission income \ndecreased by EUR\xc2\xa049\xc2\xa0million. Due to the volatility in the \nfinancial markets, Private Banking clients were less active \nin securities transactions, while more clients also opted \nfor execution only instead of managed portfolios. In \naddition, the raised client threshold for advisory services \nresulted in lower advisory volumes. \n\nOther operating income\xc2\xa0decreased by EUR\xc2\xa0195\xc2\xa0million to \nEUR\xc2\xa0111\xc2\xa0million (2017: EUR\xc2\xa0307\xc2\xa0million). Excluding the \nsale proceeds\xc2\xa0of EUR\xc2\xa0263\xc2\xa0million (tax exempt) from\xc2\xa0the \nPB Asia divestments in 2017, other operating income in \n2018 rose by EUR\xc2\xa068\xc2\xa0million. This was mainly the result \nof\xc2\xa0positive incidentals of EUR\xc2\xa060\xc2\xa0million relating to the \nsale proceeds and provision releases from divestments \n(the sale of Private Banking Luxembourg and asset \nmanagement activities in France). \n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadershipGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherStrategy and performance\x0cStrategy and performance  /  Business performance  /  Private Banking\n\n28\n\nPersonnel expenses\xc2\xa0decreased by EUR\xc2\xa082\xc2\xa0million to \nEUR\xc2\xa0390\xc2\xa0million (2017: EUR\xc2\xa0472\xc2\xa0million).

We have a strong market \nposition in the Netherlands, serving clients with revenues \nin excess of EUR\xc2\xa0250\xc2\xa0million. We are leveraging the Dutch \nfranchise in four selected Northwest European countries \n(France, Germany, United Kingdom and Belgium), where \nwe serve clients in a variety of sectors. Globally we focus \non three selected sectors and are present in 14 countries \nor jurisdictions. CIB is sector-led and offers a wide range \nof services and products in global markets and lending. \nWe have specialised activities in Clearing and Trade & \nCommodity Finance.\n\nBusiness developments\nIntroduction\nIn August 2018, CIB updated its strategic direction and \nset a financial target of delivering >10% RoE in 20211. \nThe\xc2\xa0updated strategic direction has three main drivers. \nThese are to:\n \xc3\x85 Reduce capital usage by EUR\xc2\xa05\xc2\xa0billion RWA\xc2\xa0by 2020, \namong\xc2\xa0lower-yielding and cyclical clients, as well as \nin\xc2\xa0financing structures that are sensitive to higher \ncapital floors under Basel IV.\n\n \xc3\x85 Save EUR\xc2\xa080\xc2\xa0million in costs through FTE reductions \n\nand IT rationalisation.\n\n \xc3\x85 Transform into a capital-efficient business model \n\nby centralising lending and coverage activities, \nimplementing central portfolio management, and \nincreasing our focus on distribution and on clients with \nmultiple product needs.\n\nThe strategic redirection of CIB is in line with the three \nbank-wide strategic pillars of supporting our clients\xe2\x80\x99 \ntransition to sustainability, reinventing the customer \nexperience and building a future-proof bank.\n\nDutch banks \xe2\x80\x93 including ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO \xe2\x80\x93 have agreed \nto\xc2\xa0compensate small business clients who were sold \ninterest rate derivatives in recent years, possibly \nwithout\xc2\xa0sufficient advice. Payments follow an agreement \nbetween the banks, the Netherlands Authority for the \nFinancial Markets and the government. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO is \nreassessing approximately 7,500 client files. Currently, \nwe\xe2\x80\x99re finalising offers to the last few hundred clients \nentitled to compensation under the agreement. Our aim \nis\xc2\xa0to deliver offer letters to all eligible clients by the end \nof\xc2\xa0the first quarter 2019. At present, we don\xe2\x80\x99t expect \nany\xc2\xa0adjustment to the provision we took in recent years \nto\xc2\xa0cover compensation to clients.\n\n1  Basel III RWAs and a CET1 target of 13.5%.\n\nSupporting our clients\xe2\x80\x99 transition to sustainability\nWe aim to create long-term value for and with our clients \nand other stakeholders. We want to contribute to the \ntransition towards a sustainable economy that is Green \nHouse Gas (GHG) emission-neutral and respectful of \nhuman rights, and that protects our planet\xe2\x80\x99s life, land \nand\xc2\xa0water. We want to play a leading role in the transition \nto a\xc2\xa0more sustainable world and help our customers in \ntheir transition to more sustainable business models.\n\nOur firm belief in \xe2\x80\x98Banking for better\xe2\x80\x99 is reflected in the \nmany initiatives we started in 2018, examples of which \ninclude:\n \xc3\x85 The launch of the Energy Transition Fund in May; \n\na\xc2\xa0EUR\xc2\xa0200\xc2\xa0million fund focusing on opportunities in \nsustainable energy, energy efficiency/carbon reduction, \nsmart infrastructures and clean mobility.\n\n \xc3\x85 Our seven\xc2\xa0sustainable sector plans with clear \n\nobjectives for the years to come.\n\n \xc3\x85 The issue in April, of our third green bond. The green \n\nassets underlying this bond are mortgage loans for \nenergy-efficient homes and financing for offshore \nwindfarm\xc2\xa0projects.\xc2\xa0\n\n \xc3\x85 The launching by ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO, ING and Rabobank of \n\njoint circular economy finance guidelines designed \nto provide better insight into financial backing for \nthe\xc2\xa0circular economy and help drive such financing.\xc2\xa0\n\n \xc3\x85 Being one of the leading banks developing responsible \nship recycling standards through our\xc2\xa0partnership in the \nSustainable Shipping Initiative.\n\nReinventing the customer experience\nCIB\xe2\x80\x99s business model is built on sustainable relationships \nwith multi-product clients.

The majority\xc2\xa0of Group \nFunctions\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0costs are allocated to the businesses.\n\nInnovation & Technology\nInnovation & Technology supports the Group by facilitating \ninnovation, managing Group programs, and providing \nservices in the areas of IT, information security, data,  \nback-office processing, facilities management and \nprocurement, both in the Netherlands and internationally. \n\nFinance\nFinance helps keep the Group on track to achieve the \ngoals defined in its long-term strategy. It is the primary \nsupplier of management and reporting information to the \nGroup\xe2\x80\x99s internal and external stakeholders, and plays an \nindependent role in delivering management information \nand challenging business decisions. Finance provides \na\xc2\xa0strong financial control environment and ensures \ncompliance with accounting standards and requirements \nset by the regulatory authorities. It consists of the \nfollowing main departments: Financial Accounting, \nControlling, Investor Relations, ALM, Treasury and Tax.\n\nRisk Management, Legal and Compliance\nA strong, sustainable bank is reliant on sound risk \nmanagement. Risk management secures a sound risk/\nreward ratio by maintaining a bank-wide, moderate risk \nprofile as part of our long-term strategy. This risk profile is \nmanaged on the basis of an integrated risk management \nframework, in which all risk types, cross-risk types and \noverarching risks are identified in order to provide a single, \nintegrated view of the risk profile of the bank and its \nvarious businesses. Risk Management takes careful \naccount of this integrated risk profile and seeks to balance \nactions so as to ensure the moderate risk profile is \nmaintained. The main risk types are credit, market, \nliquidity, business and operational (non-financial) risks. \nUnderlying these main risk types are various sub-risk \ntypes. Risk appetite statements are set both for the \n\nmain\xc2\xa0and the sub-risk types. The Risk, funding & capital \nmanagement section of this report elaborates on the \nbank\xe2\x80\x99s risk profile, risk taxonomy and risk appetite.\n\nHR, Transformation & Communications\nThe primary responsibility of HR, Transformation and \nCommunications is to help the Group\xe2\x80\x99s businesses \nput\xc2\xa0clients centre stage by managing human resources \nand the bank\xe2\x80\x99s corporate identity and reputation.\xc2\xa0HR, \nTransformation and Communications aims to prevent \nreputational damage and to manage and improve the \nGroup\xe2\x80\x99s reputation, brand name and brand value within \nand outside the Netherlands in a consistent manner \nand\xc2\xa0to\xc2\xa0position the Group as a trustworthy and \nsustainable\xc2\xa0organisation. As part of this process, \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xc2\xa0Foundation runs social projects and \ncoordinates activities that promote social engagement.\n\nGroup Audit, Strategy & Sustainability and \nCorporate\xc2\xa0Office\nGroup Audit provides independent oversight and control, \non behalf of senior and executive management, of the \ncore processes, policies and procedures that are designed \nto ensure that the Group complies with both the letter \nand\xc2\xa0spirit of general and industry-specific legislation and \nregulations.

Additionally it formulates the Group\xe2\x80\x99s \noverall sustainability strategies and ensures that sustainable \nbanking is embedded in the Group\xe2\x80\x99s business practices. \nThe Corporate Office is also part of Group Functions.\n\nFinancial review\nFinancial highlights\n \xc3\x85 Operating income decreased\xc2\xa0by 8%,\xc2\xa0mainly due \n\nto\xc2\xa0lower hedge accounting results and partly offset \nby\xc2\xa0positive revaluations and incidentals.\n\n \xc3\x85 Expenses directly incurred by Group Functions \n\ndecreased as a result of\xc2\xa0lower restructuring provisions \nand the\xc2\xa0benefits of\xc2\xa0cost-saving programmes.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionRisk, funding & capitalLeadership structureGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherStrategy and performance\x0cStrategy and performance  /  Business performance  /  Group Functions\n\n33\n\nOperating results\n\n(in\xc2\xa0millions)\n\nNet interest income\nNet fee and commission income\nOther operating income\nOperating income\nPersonnel expenses\nOther expenses\nOperating expenses\nOperating result\nImpairment charges on financial instruments\nOperating profit/(loss) before taxation\nIncome tax expense\nProfit/(loss) for the period\n\n2018\n\n-16\n40\n196\n220\n794\n-635\n160\n60\n-16\n76\n64\n13\n\n2017\n\n-38\n28\n248\n238\n876\n-689\n187\n51\n4\n48\n52\n-4\n\nChange\n\n58%\n42%\n-21%\n-8%\n-9%\n8%\n-14%\n17%\n\n60%\n22%\n\nNet profit\xc2\xa0rose by EUR\xc2\xa017\xc2\xa0million owing to lower costs, \nwhich were partly offset by lower revenues.\n\nNet interest income\xc2\xa0amounted to EUR\xc2\xa016\xc2\xa0million negative \n(2017: EUR\xc2\xa038\xc2\xa0million negative). The figure for 2018 \nincludes a provision release relating to securities financing \nactivities discontinued in 2009 (EUR\xc2\xa035\xc2\xa0million). If adjusted \nfor this, the decrease was mainly attributable to a decline \nin duration-related interest results, partly offset by the \npositive impact of approximately EUR\xc2\xa080\xc2\xa0million resulting \nfrom the updating of the model used for non-maturing \ndeposits and the reallocation of net interest income to the \nbusiness segment, as well as higher mortgage penalty fees.\n\nNet fee and commission income increased by EUR\xc2\xa012\xc2\xa0million \nto EUR\xc2\xa040\xc2\xa0million (2017: EUR\xc2\xa028\xc2\xa0million), partly due to the \nincrease in net fee and commission income from Stater \n(mortgage service provider).\n\nOther operating income decreased to EUR\xc2\xa0196\xc2\xa0million \n(2017:\xc2\xa0EUR\xc2\xa0248\xc2\xa0million).

If adjusted for these \nrestructuring provisions, personnel expenses decreased \non the back of the lower average number of FTE in 2018, \npartly offset by salary increases and the one-off payment \nof EUR\xc2\xa01,000 per employee that was provided for in the \nCollective Labour Agreement. \n\nOther expenses amounted to EUR\xc2\xa0635\xc2\xa0million negative \n(2017: EUR\xc2\xa0689\xc2\xa0million negative).

EU IFRS is \nmainly used to measure the bank\xe2\x80\x99s financial results and \nposition. Regulatory and economic capital are more suitable \nfor certain risk measurement purposes because EU IFRS \nclassifies the financial position by class of product, whereas \nthe objective of regulatory reporting is to take a risk-sensitive \nview on the bank\xe2\x80\x99s portfolio and to ensure that sufficient \ncapital buffers for unexpected losses and sufficient liquidity \nbuffers are maintained. In addition, the financial position \naccording to EU IFRS provides a liquidity view instead \nof\xc2\xa0a\xc2\xa0credit view.\n\nEU IFRS reporting scope  1\nThe consolidation scope of ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO is determined in \naccordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements \nand IFRS 11 Joint arrangements. More information can be \nfound in the Annual Financial Statements.\n\nRegulatory reporting scope  v\nThe scope of consolidation for the purpose of calculating \nregulatory and economic capital (based on the CRD IV and \nCRR) is generally the same as the consolidation scope under \nEU IFRS and includes subsidiaries which are directly or \nindirectly controlled by ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO and active in the banking \nand financial sectors. Subsidiaries consolidated under \nEU\xc2\xa0IFRS but active in sectors other than banking and finance \nare excluded from the regulatory scope of consolidation. \n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership structureGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherRisk, funding & capital\x0cRisk, funding & capital  /  Risk, funding & capital\xc2\xa0management  /  Risk approach\n\n37\n\nRisk, funding & \ncapital\xc2\xa0management\n\nThis section provides an overview of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s approach to risk, funding and capital \nmanagement, including its strategies, measurement approaches and risk governance \nframework. Portfolio developments are described in the Risk, funding & capital review section.      \n\nRisk approach\n\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO is committed to being a well-capitalised \nbank\xc2\xa0with sufficient liquidity that focuses on delivering \nsustainable value to its stakeholders. We are committed \nto\xc2\xa0maintaining a sound balance between risk and reward \nas well as a bank-wide moderate risk profile as part of our \nlong-term strategy. We thoroughly evaluate the long-term \nrisk and return implications of our operations on an \nongoing basis.\n\nRisk profile v27\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s risk profile is managed by way of an \nintegrated risk management framework, which identifies \nall types of risk and cross-risk as well as overarching risks \nin order to provide a single, integrated view on the risk \nprofile of the bank and its business lines. By taking an \nintegrated view of our risk profile, we strive to carefully \nbalance actions in order to manage the risk profile within \nthe moderate risk profile.\n\nThe following sections describe the risk taxonomy, risk \nappetite, risk culture, risk governance and risk measurement, \nall of which are key elements of our moderate risk profile. \nFor more information on the balance sheet composition, \nplease refer to the Risk, funding & capital review section.\n\nRisk taxonomy b7\nOur risk taxonomy classifies risks into risk types to \nwhich\xc2\xa0the bank is, or could be, exposed.

The strategic RAS is approved \nby\xc2\xa0the Executive Board and Supervisory Board.\n\nSenior management monitors the bank\xe2\x80\x99s activities, \nbased\xc2\xa0on the risk appetite. The status of adherence to the \nrisk appetite, and its outlook, are discussed on a monthly \nbasis in the Executive Board and on a quarterly basis \nby\xc2\xa0the Supervisory Board, based on the Enterprise \nRisk\xc2\xa0Management report.       \xc2\xa0The cascaded risk appetites \n(BLRAS, LRAS, ERAS) are monitored based on their \nrespective reports, and discussed and approved at their \nrespective levels.\n\nThe elements of the strategic RAS ensure a coherent \nbalance between return and value creation, our business \nmodel, capital and liquidity & funding, taking into account \nthe conduct, governance and control framework shown in \nthe figure below.

This risk indicator framework \nconsists of statements set for each main and sub-risk type \npresented in the risk taxonomy. Each statement consists \nof one or more quantitative and/or qualitative indicators, \n\nreferred to as key risk indicators (KRI). For every KRI, \na\xc2\xa0limit is set against which the actual risk profile is \nmonitored. If the limit of a KRI is breached, action is \nrequired to bring our risk profile back within the limit. \nTo\xc2\xa0allow for timely action, early warnings are in place \nto\xc2\xa0prevent breaches.\n\nExamples of KRIs in our risk appetite include:\n \xc3\x85 Regulatory and internal capital ratios\n \xc3\x85 Risk-adjusted return measures\n \xc3\x85 Concentration limits for single counterparties,  \n\nindustry sectors and countries\n\n \xc3\x85 Economic capital and risk-weighted asset limits \n\nfor\xc2\xa0various risk types\n\n \xc3\x85 Liquidity ratios (LtD, LCR, NSFR)\n \xc3\x85 Market risk parameters (duration, NII-at-Risk)\n \xc3\x85 Operational risk parameters (outstanding issues)\n \xc3\x85 Reputational parameters (NPS, employee \n\nengagement\xc2\xa0score)\n\nWhen setting the statement for each risk type, the \nfollowing aspects are considered in view of the corporate \nstrategy, market standards (such as peer analyses), \nthe\xc2\xa0economic environment, regulations, the views of \nour\xc2\xa0stakeholders and the actual risk profile, as well as \ninternal insights and risk management tools.

To continually reinforce \nbank-wide awareness of non-financial risks, a permanent \neducation tool and training app are used, while more \nspecific training is also available for each business line \nand\xc2\xa0for specific roles or functions. Employees are also \nexpected to adhere to the ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO culture principles \nand to act in accordance with the code of conduct. These \nare fundamental to everything we do and describe how \nwe act as a bank, how we make decisions, and how we \ndeal with various dilemmas.

The \ntwo other executive committees are the Group Regulatory \nCommittee and the Group Disclosure Committee. \n\nThe Executive Board is ultimately responsible for a \nbalanced assessment of the bank\xe2\x80\x99s commercial interests \nand the risks to be taken within the boundaries of the risk \nappetite. In addition to the risk committees, the Executive \nBoard itself makes decisions that are of material significance \nfor the risk profile, capital allocation and liquidity of \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO. The terms and conditions of the committees \nare specified in the Risk Governance Charter.\n\nGroup Risk Committee\nThe Group Risk Committee (GRC) is mandated by the \nExecutive Board to monitor, assess and manage the \nbank\xe2\x80\x99s risk profile in relation to the risk appetite. The GRC \nis, for example, responsible for establishing a product \napproval process to ensure we only accept risks that \nwe\xc2\xa0understand and that serve the interests of clients, \nand\xc2\xa0for ensuring the adequate functioning of this process. \nThe GRC has delegated specific approval powers to \nsubsidiary risk committees, but remains responsible \non\xc2\xa0behalf of the Executive Board.\n\nGroup Central Credit Committee\nThe Group Central Credit Committee (CCC) is mandated \nby the Executive Board to decide on the acceptance of \ncounterparty risk in respect of individual persons, legal \nentities and public administrative bodies relating to credit \nproposals. In certain cases, for example above a specific \nthreshold, the CCC\xe2\x80\x99s decisions require final approval \nby\xc2\xa0the Executive Board.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership structureGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceLeadership & governanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherRisk, funding & capital\x0cRisk, funding & capital  /  Risk, funding & capital\xc2\xa0management  /  Risk approach\n\n41\n\nCapital\nRegulatory capital (CRD IV/CRR) bv\nUnder the Basel framework as implemented in European \nlegislation (CRD IV and CRR), banks are required to hold \ncapital to cover financial risks. Banks determine the level \nof risks for the three major risk types (credit, operational \nand market risk) in terms of aggregated risk weighted \nassets (RWA). The capital requirements are stated as \na\xc2\xa0percentage of RWA. Under Pillar 1, banks are required \nto\xc2\xa0hold a regulatory fixed percentage of RWA in capital. \nUnder Pillar 2, supervisors impose an additional \xe2\x80\x93 bank \nspecific \xe2\x80\x93 percentage of RWA in addition to the Pillar 1 \nrequirement. The so-called capital buffers are a requirement \nin addition to Pillar 1 and 2, also defined as percentages \nof\xc2\xa0RWA. The capital buffer requirements are a mixture \nof\xc2\xa0percentages prescribed by law and percentages set \nby\xc2\xa0various regulators.\n\nEconomic capital\nIn addition to regulatory required capital, for Pillar 2, we \ncalculate economic capital (EC). Economic capital covers \nall risk types in our risk taxonomy for which capital \nis\xc2\xa0deemed to be the mitigating instrument to cover \nunexpected losses, and is used as the key metric for \ninternal risk measurement and management. It is the \namount of capital we reserve in order to achieve a \nsufficient level of protection against large unexpected \nlosses that could result from extreme market conditions \nor events.\n\nInternal models are used to calculate EC at a 99.95% \nconfidence level and a one-year time horizon. This implies \nthat the estimated capital figure for the coming year is \nsufficient to cover a level of loss that will be exceeded \nin\xc2\xa0only 0.05% of all possible cases.\n\nEC is aggregated for all risk types to determine the total \nEC at bank level and to support capital allocation, ex-post \nperformance measurement and risk-appetite setting such \nas industry concentration risk limits. EC is also used at a \ntransactional level in loan-pricing tools. These tools act as a \ndecision-making mechanism for assessing the profitability \nof a new or existing transaction in terms of the risk-adjusted \nreturn on risk-adjusted capital (RARORAC).\n\nGroup Asset & Liability Committee\nThe Group Asset & Liability Committee (ALCO) is \nmandated by the Executive Board to decide on the \ncapital\xc2\xa0adequacy, the liquidity risk profile, the market risk \nin the\xc2\xa0banking book and the funds transfer pricing of \nthe\xc2\xa0organisation and its subsidiaries, within the policies \nand\xc2\xa0limits approved by the GRC.\n\nMore information about Governance in general and the \nGroup Regulatory Committee and the Group Disclosure \nCommittee is provided in the Leadership & governance \nchapter.\n\nRisk measurement v25\nWe develop and use internal models to quantify the risk \nfor most risk types in the risk taxonomy. The models for \ncredit, operational, market, liquidity and business risk are \nthe most widely used and allow for measuring the level \nof\xc2\xa0risk. They support day-to-day decision-making, as well \nas periodic monitoring and reporting on developments in \nthe bank\xe2\x80\x99s portfolios and activities. In most cases, models \nquantify the probability and severity of an event, i.e. the \nlikelihood that an event will occur and the loss the bank \nmay suffer as a consequence of that event. This information \nserves as the basis for ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s internal measures \nof\xc2\xa0risk (economic capital) and as key input for calculating \nthe minimum regulatory capital requirements according \nto\xc2\xa0the Basel framework (regulatory capital).\n\nNew models require formal internal and external approval \nbefore being implemented and used. Internal approval for \nthe use (or continued use) of a model is obtained from the \nMethodology Acceptance Group (MAG), a sub-committee \nof the Group Risk Committee. When required, external \napproval is obtained from the regulator.\n\nThe modelling departments develop models in close \ncooperation with the relevant business and risk experts. \nIn\xc2\xa0principle, we review models annually. This means \nthat\xc2\xa0we back-test the models against historical data and, \nwhere relevant, benchmark calibration of the models with \nexternal studies. When model performance degrades, or \nwhen degradation is suspected, risk management can \nimpose capital add-ons to the models. These add-ons are \ncalculated by a comprehensive framework covering both \ninherent weaknesses in the models and weaknesses in \nthe model processes such as delays in reviews.\n\nThe independent Model Validation Department validates \nall internal models. Validation guidelines ensure objectivity, \nconsistency, transparency and continuity. Models are \nvalidated according to these principles and reviewed \nagainst internal and regulatory requirements.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadershipGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceLeadership & governanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherRisk, funding & capital\x0cRisk, funding & capital  /  Risk, funding & capital\xc2\xa0management  /  Risk approach\n\n42\n\nEC Quality Assessment\nThe EC models described above form the core of the \nInternal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP). \nIn order to monitor and secure the quality of the EC \nframework and its outcome in terms of capital adequacy, \nan EC Quality Assessment (ECQA) is performed yearly as \npart of the ICAAP. For each main risk type, the calculated \nEC figure is evaluated in the following areas:\n \xc3\x85 Risk coverage;\n \xc3\x85 Responsiveness to internal and external developments;\n \xc3\x85 Data quality;\n \xc3\x85 Compliance with EC policy;\n \xc3\x85 Validity of choices and assumptions.\n\nIf considered necessary, an additional capital buffer \n(\xe2\x80\x98EC\xc2\xa0add-on\xe2\x80\x99) is taken to cover any identified shortfalls \nin\xc2\xa0the EC.\n\nStress testing and scenario analysis bv8\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO uses stress testing and scenario analysis \nas\xc2\xa0an important risk management instrument, looking \nat\xc2\xa0profitability, capital and liquidity risk from a bank-wide \nperspective on a regular basis. In addition, sub-portfolio \nand risk type-specific stress testing and scenario analysis \nare executed.\n\nStress testing purposes\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO applies stress test and scenario analysis \nfor\xc2\xa0several purposes, including:\n \xc3\x85 Risk-appetite setting and monitoring: the outcome \nof stress testing is used for setting and monitoring \nrisk appetite limits and targets, including limits under \nstress. If the stress test outcome breaches a limit, \nmitigating actions will be considered to close the \nshortfall.

Both systemic risks (e.g. \nmacroeconomic risks) and ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO-specific risks \n(e.g.\xc2\xa0cyber attack or adverse outcomes in legal procedures) \nare considered. Also, sensitivity analysis is used to gain \ninsight into key vulnerabilities. Based on the risk identification, \nscenarios are defined. Alongside most likely scenarios, \nwe\xc2\xa0also define severe, but plausible scenarios. Scenarios \ncan have a short-term horizon, e.g. an instant market \nshock, or a long-term horizon, e.g. a multi-year recession.\n\nScenario projections are based on quantitative models \nas\xc2\xa0well as expert opinion procedures. In general, results \nare presented excluding and including potential mitigating \nactions, taking into account contingency plans. Two types \nof management actions can be distinguished in the stress \ntest and scenario analysis: i) direct actions based on \nthe\xc2\xa0scenario exercise and ii) actions that would be taken \nif\xc2\xa0the scenario were to materialise.\n\nGiven the importance of stress testing in terms of sound \nrisk management, the Executive Committee is involved \nthroughout the process and its governance.

The qualitative and quantitative details of \nthe credit risk associated with the loan must be assessed \nprior to approval. Information must be provided on matters \nsuch as the purpose, details and structure of the proposed \ncredit facility, the borrower and other counterparties, the \nindustry and geography, management and owners, and \nfinancial and non-financial analyses. The credit decision is \nbased on independent assessments of both the commercial \nand the credit risk function.\n\nFor a credit approval decision within Programme Lending, \nclient-specific aspects and internal/external data are taken \ninto consideration to calculate a credit score (scorecard). \nThe credit decision is based on the outcome of the \nscorecard and policy rules.\n\nCredit risk monitoring\nConsistent and regular monitoring helps to safeguard the \nbank\xe2\x80\x99s position in relation to all risks associated with the \ncounterparty, credit type or portfolio. Monitoring starts \nwhen the credit facility has been provided and continues \nthroughout the lifecycle of the credit facility and the \nrelationship with the counterparty until the exposure is \nrepaid and/or the limit is cancelled.\n\nShould a situation arise in which an individual counterparty \nshows signs of credit risk deterioration, but is not in \ndefault, a \xe2\x80\x98watch\xe2\x80\x99 status is assigned. A \xe2\x80\x98watch\xe2\x80\x99 status \nindicates that a counterparty requires close monitoring \nand appropriate follow-up measures in order to prevent \na\xc2\xa0default. Indicators for the \xe2\x80\x98watch\xe2\x80\x99 status are: changes \nin\xc2\xa0risk profile, liquidity problems, management issues, \nmarket outlook, potential breach of credit agreement, \nsolvency issues and uncertain continuity.\n\nRestructuring & Recovery\nCredit facilities that are subject to a default event are \nmandatorily transferred to the Financial Restructuring & \nRecovery department (FR&R). Credit facilities with an \nidentified significantly high risk can be transferred to the \nFR&R if specialised restructuring knowledge is required. \nIf\xc2\xa0a \xe2\x80\x98going concern\xe2\x80\x99 approach is applicable and return to \na\xc2\xa0performing status is considered likely, the credit facility \nis transferred to the Restructuring team, which devises \n\na\xc2\xa0plan aimed either at rehabilitation or at enhancing the \nlikelihood of full repayment. In all other cases, the credit \nfacility is transferred to the Recovery team.\n\nProgramme Lending contracts are transferred to the \nRestructuring team when a default status is assigned \nbecause payments have been past due for more than \n90\xc2\xa0days or because another default trigger applies. \nIf\xc2\xa0restructuring is ultimately not effective, the client \nis\xc2\xa0transferred to other internal departments or external \nparties (such as Intrum) for debt collection.\n\nOnce a client is considered to be able to meet its future \npayment obligations and the involvement of FR&R \nis\xc2\xa0no\xc2\xa0longer required, the client is transferred back \nto\xc2\xa0the\xc2\xa0business.\n\nCredit risk measurement bv2\nWe use internal models to measure the credit risk \nassociated with exposures to individual clients and \nportfolios. To estimate the expected losses for all type \nof\xc2\xa0exposure classes, these models quantify the clients\xe2\x80\x99 \nProbability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD) \nand\xc2\xa0Loss Given Default (LGD).\n\nThe models vary from purely statistical to expert-based \nand employ quantitative as well as qualitative risk drivers. \nUsing input values for the risk drivers, the models \ncalculate PDs, EADs and LGDs. EAD is established \non\xc2\xa0a\xc2\xa0monthly basis, using actual limits and outstanding \nexposure data. PD and LGD are determined at least \nannually.\n\nThe models\xe2\x80\x99 estimates are embedded in the credit \napproval and internal reporting processes in order to \ncalculate economic capital and the minimum regulatory \ncapital requirements under the Basel Advanced Internal \nRatings Based (AIRB) approach.

According to \nthe\xc2\xa0three lines of defence model, the use of the rating \nsystems is separated from the development and validation \nof these systems. The independent Credit Risk Control \nUnit oversees the proper use of the systems and reports \non the coverage of the use of appropriate reporting \nmodels.

If all or part \nof a facility is undrawn (i.e. the outstanding amount is less \nthan the approved limit) at the time of the EaD calculation, \na portion of the undrawn amount is added to the exposure \nto reflect the observation that counterparties draw larger \nportions of their approved facilities when nearing default.\n\nLoss Given Default\nLoss Given Default (LGD) models estimate the amount of \nmoney the bank will lose if the counterparty defaults. It is \nexpressed as a percentage of the outstanding amount at \ndefault. Typically an LGD will never be 100% as the bank \nuses mitigating techniques, such as securing collateral, \nto\xc2\xa0minimise losses in the event of default. The LGD is \nthus\xc2\xa0the portion of the exposure at default that is left \nafter\xc2\xa0realisation of secured collateral. Other factors, \nsuch\xc2\xa0as the\xc2\xa0facility seniority, will also affect the LGD rate.\n\nCapital for credit risk\nRegulatory capital\nCapital requirements for credit risk are determined by \ncalculating all top-level exposure classes in accordance \nwith the Advanced Internal Rating Based Approach (AIRB). \nWithin these exposure classes, a number of smaller \nportfolios are temporarily or permanently calculated \naccording to the Standardised Approach (SA). ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO \nhas been granted approval to apply the AIRB, including a \nnumber of exemptions, by the relevant competent authority.\n\nEconomic capital\nThe EC model for credit risk uses a Monte Carlo \nsimulation to determine a full portfolio loss distribution, \ntaking into account specific portfolio characteristics and \ndiversification effects. Loan facilities are valued on an \neconomic value (mark-to-market) basis to ensure that loss \nestimates can be based not only on defaulting borrowers, \nbut also on possible credit migrations and changes \nassociated with the market values of loans.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadershipGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceLeadership & governanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherRisk, funding & capital\x0cRisk, funding & capital  /  Risk, funding & capital\xc2\xa0management  /  Credit risk management\n\n46\n\nSpecific counterparty credit risk v2l\nSpecific calculation methodologies are applied to determine \ncounterparty credit exposure relating to over-the-counter \n(OTC) derivative instruments and securities financing.\n\nOTC derivative instruments\nOTC derivatives are financial instruments which are \nused\xc2\xa0to cover current and/or future financial risks or to \nachieve additional return on an investment. They consist \nof\xc2\xa0transactions concluded between two parties and of \nwhich the value is based on an underlying base value \n(e.g.\xc2\xa0interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodities, \nequities).\n\nSecurities financing transactions\nThe balance sheet item Securities financing refers to \nsecurities lending, a market activity whereby securities \nare temporarily transferred from a lender to a borrower, \nsubject to the commitment to re-deliver the securities, \nusually in the short term. The borrower collateralises \nthe\xc2\xa0transaction with cash or other securities of equal \nor\xc2\xa0greater value than the borrowed securities in order \nto\xc2\xa0protect the lender against counterparty credit risk. \nAs\xc2\xa0an intermediary between clients and the market, \nwe\xc2\xa0act both as lender and borrower.\n\nRegulatory and economic exposure calculation \nfor\xc2\xa0specific counterparty credit risk\nThe regulatory calculation methodology applied for \ncalculation of the counterparty credit risk exposure \nvalue\xc2\xa0(EAD) of OTC derivative instruments is the mark- \nto-market method.\n\nThe economic counterparty credit risk exposure \ncalculation of OTC derivative instruments is based on \nthe\xc2\xa0mark-to-market (MtM, i.e. current exposure) plus \nan\xc2\xa0add-on for potential future exposure. The add-on is \ncalculated to cover 95% of the potential positive MtM \nmovement in favour of the bank for the entire deal tenor. \nThe add-on is determined by several parameters, such \nas\xc2\xa0the type of derivative product (underlying), deal tenor, \ncurrency (pair) and the absence or presence of netting \nand\xc2\xa0collateral agreements.\n\nFor securities lending, the Financial Collateral Comprehensive \nMethod (FCCM) is used in the regulatory calculations. \nFor\xc2\xa0economic counterparty exposure calculations, \nthe\xc2\xa0FCCM is applied with additional conservatism.\n\nWrong-way risk\nThis risk refers to transactions whose counterparty \ncredit\xc2\xa0exposure arising from OTC or Securities Lending \ntransactions is positively correlated to the counterparty\xe2\x80\x99s \nprobability of default. In other words, the credit exposure \nincreases when the credit quality of the counterparty \ndeteriorates. In general, we do not engage in such wrong-\nway risk transactions. We are also prudent in considering \n\ntransactions in which this correlation is less obvious, e.g. \ntransactions where a general wrong-way risk component \nforms part of the deal, or where a counterparty and the \nunderlying issuer are in a similar industry, or in the same \ncountry or geographical region.\n\nCredit concentration risk bv\nCredit concentration risk is the risk of loss arising from \nlarge exposures, as related to the total risk exposure of \nthe bank, to a single counterparty or to counterparties that \nare positively and highly correlated. Positively correlated \ncounterparties are counterparties of which the credit \nquality will move in the same direction under similar \ncircumstances. Limiting excessive concentrations is \nfundamental to our credit risk strategy, which is why we \naim to keep the credit risk portfolio sufficiently granular \nand diversified.\n\nTo avoid excessive credit risk concentrations, Risk \nManagement sets maximum levels for subgroups \nin\xc2\xa0the\xc2\xa0following categories:\n \xc3\x85 Single counterparty and groups of related \n\ncounterparties (counterparty concentration);\n\n \xc3\x85 Countries (geographic concentration);\n \xc3\x85 Industry sectors (industry concentration).\n\nCounterparty concentration\nCounterparty concentration credit risk is the risk of loss \narising from relatively large exposures to counterparties \nbelonging to the same risk group. The One Obligor \nExposure (OOE) is the exposure to a risk group, including \nall drawn and undrawn facilities granted plus all indirect \nexposure to the risk group, including guarantees and any \nother recourse claims. A risk group is an interrelated group \nof counterparties with a high degree of dependency on \neach other due to a control relationship. This control \nrelationship may be due to direct or indirect majority \ninterests being held by the same shareholder or group \nof\xc2\xa0shareholders. Counterparty credit concentration risk \nis\xc2\xa0measured by the OOE and the Economic Capital (EC) \nper\xc2\xa0counterparty. The bank limits its counterparty credit \nrisk by setting OOE and EC limits. Additionally, all credit \napplications with an OOE and/or EC above a certain \nthreshold are reviewed by the Executive Board.\n\nGeographic concentration\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO has branches and subsidiaries located \noutside\xc2\xa0the Netherlands, as well as clients who operate \ninternationally. Consequently the bank is exposed to \ncountry risk, which is the risk of credit losses arising from \ncountry-specific events or circumstances. Management \nof\xc2\xa0country risk focuses on cross-border risk, which \nincludes the risk that funds, goods or services cannot be \ntransferred out of a country as a result of actions by local \nauthorities or because of other events impeding the \ntransfer. These risks are managed by setting country credit \nlimits, based on individual country analyses by economic, \n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership structureGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceLeadership & governanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherRisk, funding & capital\x0cRisk, funding & capital  /  Risk, funding & capital\xc2\xa0management  /  Credit risk management\n\n47\n\ncompliance and country risk experts. Country limits are \nreviewed at least once a year. Each country also has an \ninternal credit rating, which is reviewed and approved \ntwice a year and is an important factor in managing \ncountry concentration risks.\n\nWe also use guarantees to mitigate exposure risks. These \ninclude guarantees from, for example, banks, governments \nand export credit agencies. The credit quality of guarantors \nis assessed at origination and monitored to ensure the \nguarantee is valued correctly for risk mitigation purposes.\n\nIndustry concentration\nIndustry concentration risk is the risk of loss arising from \na\xc2\xa0relatively large credit exposure to counterparties active \nin a single industry. Industry concentration risk arises \nwhen deterioration in a specific industry has an effect on \nall credit exposures relating to that industry. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO \nmanages its industry concentrations by setting credit risk \neconomic capital (EC) limits as a percentage of total \ncredit\xc2\xa0risk EC per industry. In addition to the EC limits, \nEC\xc2\xa0concentration checkpoints are set to facilitate timely \nand sufficient management interventions to avoid breaching \nof the limits.\n\nCredit risk mitigation vz\nCredit risk mitigation techniques are used by the bank to \nreduce the credit risk associated with the bank\xe2\x80\x99s credit \nexposures. Such techniques relate mainly to collateral \nmanagement and guarantees, offsetting financial assets \nand liabilities, and enforcing master netting agreements \nor\xc2\xa0similar instruments.\n\nCredit risk mitigation techniques themselves entail risks \nand as such they need to meet certain requirements to \nensure they are used effectively and in line with the bank\xe2\x80\x99s \nrisk appetite. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO has therefore established \nmandatory bank-wide policies governing the use and \nmanagement of credit risk mitigation techniques, which \nare in line with regulatory requirements as well as the \nneeds of the bank and its clients. These bank-wide policies \nset out the overarching rules that must be observed by \nbusiness specific procedures and processes related to \ncredit risk mitigation.\n\nCollateral management and guarantees\nCollateral represents assets with material value that \nhave\xc2\xa0been received by (or pledged to) the bank to secure \nobligations under a credit facility or other exposure. \nTo\xc2\xa0be\xc2\xa0effective, such security needs to give the bank the \nright to appropriate and liquidate collateral on time and \nwithout impediments so that losses on the exposure at \ndefault are minimised.\n\nIn addition to its ability to minimise exposure risk, eligible \ncollateral can also reduce the regulatory and economic \ncapital the bank is required to hold as a buffer for \nunexpected losses. The Capital Requirements Regulation \nprescribes the criteria that collateral must meet to \nbecome eligible for capital reduction. These criteria, which \nprovide for legal effectiveness and enforceability, valuation \nand monitoring of collateral, aim at the effective and timely \nrealisation of collateral.\n\nOffsetting financial assets and liabilities\nFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and the net \namount is reported on the EU IFRS balance sheet if there \nis a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised \namounts and there is either an intention to settle on a net \nbasis or an intention to realise the asset and settle the \nliability simultaneously. The bank applies netting to debtor \nand creditor balances, such as current accounts, where \noffsetting is justified by formal agreement with the client, \nprovided they meet the applicable criteria.\n\nEnforceable master netting agreements  \nor similar instruments\nEnforceable master netting arrangements take into \naccount all agreements with conditions that make \noffsetting exercisable in the event of default. In addition, \nagreements are enforceable if the bank has a legally \nenforceable right to offset and does not have any ability \nand/or intention to realise the asset and settle the liability \nsimultaneously. These arrangements include derivative \nclearing agreements, global master repurchase agreements \nand global master securities lending agreements.\n\nForborne, past due and credit loss allowances   \nbvj\nLoans at risk are primarily exposures for which there \nare\xc2\xa0signs indicating that the counterparty may become \ncredit impaired in the future. Loans at risk are classified \ninto different risk categories for individual counterparties \nand days-in-arrears buckets for groups of aggregated \ncounterparties in order to optimise monitoring and review \nof these loans.\n\nForbearance b\nForbearance is the process of making concessions to \nclients who are or will soon be experiencing financial \ndifficulty, with the intention of bringing them back within \ntheir payment capacity. A forborne asset is any contract \nwhich has been entered into with a counterparty who is \nin\xc2\xa0or about to face financial difficulty, and which has been \nrefinanced or modified on terms and conditions that we \nwould not have accepted (concession) if the counterparty \nhad been financially healthy.\n\nForbearance measures can be applied to contracts on \nwhich the counterparty has already defaulted, as well \nas\xc2\xa0to contracts that are still performing.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadershipGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceLeadership & governanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherRisk, funding & capital\x0cRisk, funding & capital  /  Risk, funding & capital\xc2\xa0management  /  Credit risk management\n\n48\n\nA forborne contract will cease to qualify as forborne \nonly\xc2\xa0when all the following conditions are met: \nThe contract is considered performing;\n \xc3\x85 A minimum probation period of two years has passed \n\nfrom the date the forborne contract was considered \nperforming;\n\n \xc3\x85 Regular payments of more than an insignificant amount \n\nof principal or interest have been made during at least \nhalf of the probation period;\n\n \xc3\x85 The counterparty does not have any contract, within \n\nthe credit agreement, which is more than 30 days past \ndue at the end of the probation period.\n\nIf the forborne contract is or has become non-performing \nat the time of the forbearance measure, a mandatory cure \nperiod of at least one year applies to the contract before \nit\xc2\xa0is returned to a performing status. The cure period starts \nwhen the contract becomes non-performing or, if the contract \nwas already non-performing, from the moment the last \nforbearance measure was taken. More information about \nnon-performing can be found at the end of this section.\n\nPast due credit exposures bv\nA financial asset is past due if a counterparty fails to make \na payment on the contractual due date or if the counterparty \nhas exceeded an agreed limit. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO starts counting \ndays past due from the first day that a counterparty is past \ndue on any financial obligation.\n\nAccounting policy on measurement of\xc2\xa0allowances \nfor\xc2\xa0credit losses bvj\nSince 1 January 2018, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xc2\xa0has recognised loss \nallowances based on the expected credit loss model \n(ECL) of IFRS 9, which is designed to be forward-\nlooking. The IFRS 9 impairment requirements are \napplicable to financial assets measured at amortised \ncost or fair value through other comprehensive income \n(FVOCI), loan commitments and financial guarantee \ncontracts. These financial instruments are divided into \nthree groups, depending on the stage of credit quality \ndeterioration:\n\nStage 1\n\nPerforming\n(Initial recognition)\n\nRecognition of ECL\n\n12 month ECL\n\nChange in credit quality since initial recognition\n\nStage 2\n\nCredit risk deteriorated\n(Assets with signi\xef\xac\x81cant increase in \ncredit risk since initial recognition)\n\nStage 3\n\nDefault = Impaired\n(Credit impaired assets)\n\nLifetime ECL\n\nLifetime ECL\n\nInterest revenue\nEffective interest on gross carrying amount\n\nEffective interest on gross carrying amount\n\nEffective interest on amortised cost\n(gross carrying amount less loss allowance)\n\nStage triggers\nWe use quantitative and qualitative stage triggers to \ndetermine whether a financial instrument should be \nclassified as stage 1 or stage 2. \n\nrepresents the likelihood that a counterparty will \ndefault\xc2\xa0during the lifetime of the financial instrument \nand depends on credit risk drivers such as:\n \xc3\x85 product characteristics (e.g. repayment and interest \n\nQuantitative stage trigger\nThe key quantitative metric determining when a \nfinancial instrument is transferred from stage 1 to \nstage\xc2\xa02 is the deterioration of the lifetime probability \nof\xc2\xa0default (LPD) from the date of origination to the \nreporting date, based on internal data.

Due to limitations \nin the availability of historical data, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO \ncurrently uses a 12-month PD proxy for LPD, as we \nconsider this appropriately representative for the LPD.\n\nQualitative stage triggers\nThe bank transfers a financial instrument from stage 1 \nto stage 2 if the instrument meets one of the following \nqualitative triggers:\n \xc3\x85 Forborne status of a borrower;\n \xc3\x85 Watch status of a borrower. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO assigns \nthe\xc2\xa0watch status to individual counterparties with \n\n \xc3\x85 an\xc2\xa0increased credit risk. This process allows for \n\nintensive monitoring, early detection of deterioration\n\nin the credit portfolio and appropriate follow-up \nmeasures; or\n\n \xc3\x85 More than 30 days past due.\n\nA transfer to stage 3 will always be the result of the \ndefault of a financial instrument. A default is considered \nto have occurred when one of the default triggers (e.g. \nunlikely to pay, distressed debt restructuring, bankruptcy \nor fraud) is met. In addition, 90 days past due is used \nas a backstop for default. Materiality thresholds are \napplied for counterparties transferring to stage 3 \n(EUR\xc2\xa0500 for programme lending and EUR 5,000 \nfor\xc2\xa0non-programme lending). Below these thresholds, \namounts are reported as >90 days past due.

Forborne financial instruments are only \ntransferred back from stage 2 to stage 1 after a two-year \nprobation period. Stage 3 forborne instruments transfer \nback to stage 2 consistently with other defaulted \ninstruments. For\xc2\xa030 days past due financial instruments, \na three-month probation period is applied for transfers \nfrom stage 2 to\xc2\xa0stage 1.\n\nCalculation method\nThe amount of expected credit loss allowances is \nbased on the probability-weighted present value of all \nexpected cash shortfalls over the remaining life of the \nfinancial instrument for both on- and off-balance sheet \nexposures. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO makes a distinction between \ntwo types of calculation methods for credit loss \nallowances:\n\n \xc3\x85 Individual LECL for credit-impaired (stage 3) \nfinancial\xc2\xa0instruments with exposures above \nEUR\xc2\xa03\xc2\xa0million; and\n\n \xc3\x85 Collective 12-month\xc2\xa0ECL (stage 1) and LECL \n\nfor\xc2\xa0(stage 2 and 3) financial instruments that have \nsimilar credit risk characteristics (e.g. residential \nmortgages, consumer loans, SME loans) are \nclustered in portfolios and collectively assessed \nfor\xc2\xa0impairment losses. A\xc2\xa0collective impairment \ncalculation approach based on individual parameters \nis also applied\xc2\xa0for exposures below EUR\xc2\xa03\xc2\xa0million. \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO has introduced new models to quantify \nthe Probability of Loss (PL), Loss Given Loss (LGL) \nand Exposure at Loss (EAL) for calculating the \ncollective 12-month\xc2\xa0ECL and LECL for these financial \ninstruments. Whereas the credit loss allowance for \nthese assets is collectively determined, the stage is \ndetermined for each individual financial instrument \nseparately. \n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadershipGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceLeadership & governanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherRisk, funding & capital\x0cRisk, funding & capital  /  Risk, funding & capital\xc2\xa0management  /  Credit risk management\n\n50\n\nLifetime expected credit loss\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO defines the lifetime of credit as the \nmaximum contractual period over which the bank is \nexposed to credit risk and not a longer period, even if \nthat longer period is consistent with business practice. \nFor some contracts, such as overdraft facilities or credit \ncard, no end date is specified or amounts can be \ncontractually withdrawn by the lender at short notice. \nIn\xc2\xa0these cases, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO uses behavioural maturity \nmodels that rely on historical client behaviour, given \nthat the exposure to credit losses can extend beyond \nthe contractual period.\n \nForward-looking information\nThree different scenarios of future economic \ndevelopments are incorporated into the IFRS 9 expected \ncredit loss calculation and risk stage determination in \na\xc2\xa0probability weighted manner (at 31 December 2018: \nbaseline 60%, up 15%, down 25%). These scenarios \nare developed by ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xc2\xa0Group\xc2\xa0Economics at \nleast every quarter and reviewed at each reporting \ndate.\xc2\xa0The 28 macroeconomic variables (including GDP, \nunemployment rate, housing price index, oil price and \nEuribor 3M) are forecasted by ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xc2\xa0Group \nEconomics and used for the expected credit loss \ncalculation and selected for each\xc2\xa0specific portfolio \nseparately. The variables we use\xc2\xa0are based on statistical \nrelevance and expert judgement. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO has \naligned its forward-looking scenarios with those \nused\xc2\xa0in\xc2\xa0the budgeting process.

The following market \nrisks are inherent in the banking book:\n \xc3\x85 Interest rate risk: the risk of losses in the economic \n\nvalue of equity or the bank\xe2\x80\x99s net interest income (NII) \ndue to unfavourable yield curve developments;\xc2\xa0\n\n \xc3\x85 Credit spread risk: the risk of losses due to adverse \n\nmovements in the credit spread of liquid assets. \nThe principal source is from bonds held for liquidity \npurposes;\xc2\xa0\n\n \xc3\x85 Funding spread risk: the risk of losses due to adverse \n\nmovements in the term structure of rates at which \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO can borrow money \xe2\x80\x93 expressed as a \nspread to a benchmark such as Euribor;\xc2\xa0\n\n \xc3\x85 Equity risk: the risk of losses due to adverse \n\nmovements in equity prices, dividends and volatilities. \nEquity positions can be taken in strategic partnerships \nand joint ventures, positions in private equity and \npositions where debt held by the bank has been \nconverted into equity as part of a restructuring process;\xc2\xa0\n \xc3\x85 Property risk: this risk arising from adverse movements \n\nin property prices;\xc2\xa0\n\n \xc3\x85 Actual client behaviour, which determines the maturity \n\nof some of our client products. As we use models \nto predict this behaviour, we are exposed to model \nrisk: losses the bank could incur as a consequence \nof\xc2\xa0decisions resulting from errors in the development, \nimplementation or use of such models.\n\nKey assumptions for modelling client behaviour u\nFrom an interest rate risk perspective, the following \naspects of client behaviour are the most important:\n \xc3\x85 Client behaviour with respect to early redemption \n\nof\xc2\xa0residential mortgages. This has a significant impact \non average interest maturity of the mortgage portfolio. \nClients have the option of fully or partially prepaying \nmortgages before maturity. These prepayments \nare\xc2\xa0triggered by client behaviour such as relocation, \nredemption and curtailment.\xc2\xa0An important driver of \nprepayments is the rate incentive, i.e. the difference \nbetween the client\xe2\x80\x99s existing mortgage interest \nrate\xc2\xa0and prevailing mortgage rates. The prevailing \nmortgage rates are forecasted using a Monte Carlo \nsimulation. In addition to interest incentive, drivers such \nas loan age, seasonality and house price developments \nare taken into account;\n\n \xc3\x85 Client acceptance of the volume offered and the \ndeviation between the offered rate and the actual \ncoupon on an offered residential mortgage;\n\n \xc3\x85 Foreign exchange risk: this risk arising from adverse \n\n \xc3\x85 Client behaviour with respect to non-maturing deposits \n\nmovements in FX spot and forward rates and/or \nFX volatility. It arises for operational reasons where \nit\xc2\xa0is\xc2\xa0inefficient to hedge exposures as they arise.\n\nMarket risk in the banking book consists predominantly \nof\xc2\xa0interest rate risk, followed by credit spread risk and \nfunding spread risk.\n\nInterest rate risk in the banking book\nIn order to model and measure interest rate risk, \nassumptions are made about client behaviour, most \nimportantly with respect to the maturity of savings and \nthe prepayment of mortgages. The nature of these \nassumptions can substantially alter the anticipated interest \ncash flow pattern. Interest rate risk is continuously \nmanaged in line with the risk appetite, as\xc2\xa0the\xc2\xa0profile \nof\xc2\xa0assets and liabilities on the balance sheet can change \nif\xc2\xa0client behaviour changes.\n\nThe main sources of interest rate risk are:\n \xc3\x85 The maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities. \n\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO provides mortgages and commercial \nloans with long-term fixed interest terms. These assets \nare funded by savings and wholesale funding. These \nliabilities have a shorter average interest maturity than \nthe assets, for example current accounts;\n\nwhich are callable on demand. These savings and \ncurrent accounts are modelled using a replicating \nportfolio model to forecast future client rates. These \nfuture client rates may depend on current or lagged \nyield curves and funding costs. A maximum maturity \nof 10 years is assumed for non-maturing deposits. The \nresulting duration depends on product type and client \nbehaviour. The average duration for retail portfolios is \n2.6 years, whereas the average duration for non-retail \nportfolios is 2.4 years. The average duration for the \naggregate portfolio of modelled non-maturing deposits \nis 2.5 years, well below the regulatory 5-year cap.\n\nThe metrics used for banking book risks are dependent \nupon the assumptions made in the behavioural models. \nModels must therefore be based on extensive research, \nincluding historical data on observed client behaviour. \nModels must also be\xc2\xa0validated by the independent Model \nValidation Department and approved by duly authorised \nrisk committees. Models are assessed to determine \nwhether they behave appropriately and are statistically \nsound; if required, they are adjusted.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadershipGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceLeadership & governanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherRisk, funding & capital\x0cRisk, funding & capital  /  Risk, funding & capital\xc2\xa0management  /  Market risk management\n\n52\n\nRisk measurement for interest rate risk 8fg\nFor management purposes, the interest rate risk position \nis reported to the Asset & Liability Committee (ALCO) on \na monthly basis. ALCO reporting includes both earnings \nand value metrics, including Net Interest Income (NII) at \nRisk, duration of equity, Economic Value of Equity (EVE) \nat\xc2\xa0Risk and economic capital for market risk in the banking \nbook. These are complemented with stress testing and \nscenario analysis, which are used to ensure a comprehensive \napproach to risk management and to identify potential \nweakness. Stress testing and scenario analysis go beyond \ndetermining the impact of alternative developments of \ninterest rates. Assumptions with respect to modelling \nand\xc2\xa0client behaviour are also tested.\n\nNII-at-Risk is the difference in NII between a base scenario \nand an alternative scenario. It is defined as the worst \noutcome of the following scenarios: gradual increase or \ndecrease in interest rates by 200bps, measured over a \none-year period, and instantaneous increase or decrease \nof 100bps. NII-at-Risk includes all expected cash flows, \nincluding commercial margins and other spread components, \nfrom all interest-rate-sensitive assets, liabilities and off-\nbalance sheet items in the banking book. When calculating \nthe NII-at-Risk, a constant balance sheet is assumed where \nmaturing positions are reinvested. A floor of -100bps on \nmarket rates as well as a floor of 0bps on retail deposits \nis\xc2\xa0applied.\n\nDuration of equity measures value changes resulting from \nminor parallel shifts of the yield curve. The computation of \nduration is based on a comparison between a base curve \nand the change in the economic value of a portfolio due \nto\xc2\xa0an interest rate increase/decrease. We also measure \nthe value sensitivity to changes in individual maturities \non\xc2\xa0the yield curve.\n\nEVE-at-Risk is the loss in economic value of equity as a \nresult of various yield curve shocks. These shocks are bow \nup, bow down, steepening, flattening and tilt short end \nup\xc2\xa0and down. The impact is calculated for cash flows from \nall interest-rate-sensitive assets, liabilities and off-balance \nsheet items in the banking book. An assumption of a run-\noff balance sheet is made, where banking book positions \namortise and are not replaced by any new business. \nThe\xc2\xa0projected cash flows include commercial margins \nand\xc2\xa0other spread components and are discounted \nat\xc2\xa0the\xc2\xa0risk-free rate.\n\nEconomic capital for market risk in the banking book \nis\xc2\xa0calculated using a VaR model which determines the \neconomic capital needed to absorb losses due to adverse \nmovements in interest rates, credit spreads and foreign \nexchange rates. The model also accounts for the potential \nimpact of client behaviour, such as prepayments on \nmortgages and changes in deposits and savings balances.\n\nCredit spread risk in the banking book\nCredit spread risk for the liquidity portfolio is measured \nand limited as the impact on economic value of a 1bp \nchange in spreads to a swap rate. This is done across \nthe\xc2\xa0term structure of exposure, as well as for a parallel \nshift across the curve.\n\nFunding spread risk\nFunding spread movements can reflect changes in, \nfor\xc2\xa0example, the perceived credit quality of ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO, \nchanges in the competitive environment or changes \nin\xc2\xa0liquidity premiums. They may be entity-specific or \nsystemic in nature. If funding spreads widen, it costs \nmore to fund assets on the balance sheet. Unless this \nincreased spread is passed on to clients by increasing \nclient rates, projected net interest income will decrease.\n\nForeign exchange risk\nForeign exchange risk arises from several sources. \nThe\xc2\xa0main sources are assets and liabilities on the balance \nsheet and off-balance sheet commitments and contingent \nliabilities denominated in foreign currencies. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO \nmeasures and manages foreign exchange risk for which \nthe key metric is the Open Currency Position. In addition, \ntranslation risks on the bank\xe2\x80\x99s capital ratios, which may \nbe\xc2\xa0affected by exchange rate movements, are also \nspecifically monitored. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO aims not to be \nexposed to open currency exposures in its banking book.\n\nMarket risk management for the banking book\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO has in place a detailed risk management \nframework to identify, measure and control market risk \nin\xc2\xa0the banking book. This framework provides assurance \nthat the banking book activities remain consistent with \nthe\xc2\xa0bank\xe2\x80\x99s moderate risk profile. The goal of interest \nrate\xc2\xa0risk management is to protect current and future \nNII\xc2\xa0from adverse yield curve movements. The day-to-day \nmanagement is delegated from the Asset & Liability \nCommittee to Asset and Liability Management, while \nTreasury is responsible for the execution.\n\nThe bank applies limits to the above-mentioned interest \nrate risk measures in line with the approved risk appetite \nrequirement. The risk appetite is based on the maximum \nloss the bank is willing to accept, both in terms of net \ninterest income for one- and two-year periods and \neconomic value of equity.\n\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO uses a combination of portfolio (macro) \nhedges and specific asset or liability (micro) hedges \nto\xc2\xa0swap fixed interest rates for floating interest rate \npositions. Micro hedges are used to swap fixed funding \ntransactions and fixed investments in the liquidity buffer \nfor floating interest rate positions. In addition, macro \nhedging is applied in order to be in line with the bank\xe2\x80\x99s \nstrategy to contribute to a stable NII while protecting \nthe\xc2\xa0economic value of equity. \n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership structureGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceLeadership & governanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherRisk, funding & capital\x0cRisk, funding & capital  /  Risk, funding & capital\xc2\xa0management  /  Market risk management\n\n53\n\nMarket risk in the trading book 2\nAs part of its business strategy, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO facilitates \nclient orders, acts as a market maker in key markets and \nprovides liquidity to clients, including institutional investors \nand private clients. Market risk in the trading book is \nthe risk of losses in market value due to adverse market \nmovements. The following market risks are inherent \nin\xc2\xa0the\xc2\xa0trading book:\n \xc3\x85 Interest rate risk: arises from adverse changes in \n\ninterest rate risk curves and/or interest rate volatilities;\n\n \xc3\x85 Credit spread risk: arises from adverse changes in \n\nthe\xc2\xa0term structure of credit spreads and/or from \nchanging credit quality of debt securities or CDS \nreference entities, with impact on default probabilities;\n\n \xc3\x85 Equity risk: arises from adverse changes in equity \n\nprices, dividends and volatilities;\n\n \xc3\x85 Commodity risk: arises from adverse changes \n\nin\xc2\xa0commodity prices;\n\n \xc3\x85 Foreign exchange risk: arises from adverse changes \n\nin\xc2\xa0FX spot and forward rates and/or FX volatility.\n\nMarket risk management for the trading book   \nbv\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO has in place a detailed risk management \nframework to identify, measure and control market risk \nin\xc2\xa0the trading book. This framework provides assurance \nthat the bank\xe2\x80\x99s trading activities are consistent with its \nclient-focused business strategy and moderate risk profile. \nIn accordance with the strategy, the Trading Business Risk \nCommittee annually approves trading mandates, which \ndefine the nature and amount of the permitted transactions \nand risks, and the associated constraints. The Trading \nBusiness Risk Committee is a subsidiary committee \nof\xc2\xa0the\xc2\xa0Group Risk Committee.\n\nMarket risk measurement for the trading book   \nbv8ufg\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO measures and manages market risk in the \ntrading book on a daily basis. The key metrics used are \neconomic capital, regulatory capital, Value-at-Risk (VaR), \nStressed VaR (SVaR) and Incremental Risk Charge (IRC), \ntogether with a wide array of stress and scenario tests, \nsensitivity measures, concentration limits and notional \nlimits. These metrics are measured and monitored, with \nappropriate limits set at both bank and business-line levels.\n\nMetrics and models are managed, reviewed, assessed \nand, if required, adjusted in a similar way as in the banking \nbook. Other important tools to ensure the adequacy of \nthe\xc2\xa0models, alongside the formal validation and review of \nmodels, are the daily explanation of risk reporting figures, \nperiodic portfolio reviews and regular back-testing.\n\nValue-at-Risk\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO uses the historical simulation Value-at-Risk \n(VaR) methodology as one of its primary risk measures. \nThe VaR for market risk quantifies, with a one-sided \nconfidence level of 99%, the maximum one-day loss \nthat\xc2\xa0could occur due to changes in risk factors if positions \nremain unchanged for a period of one day. The VaR \nalso\xc2\xa0incorporates market data movements for specific \nmovements in the underlying issuer of securities. \nThe\xc2\xa0impact of historical market movements on today\xe2\x80\x99s \nportfolio is estimated on the basis of equally weighted \nmarket movements observed in the previous 300 days, \nusing a full revaluation method for the majority of risk \nfactors. The bank uses the VaR with a one-day horizon \nfor\xc2\xa0internal risk measurement, control and back-testing, \nand the VaR with a ten-day horizon to determine regulatory \ncapital. The latter is derived by scaling the one-day VaR \nby\xc2\xa0the square root of ten.\n\nThe daily VaR is back-tested against the actual mark-to-\nmarket changes calculated for each subsequent trading \nday. The number of outliers is used to assess the reliability \nof the VaR model. The model\xe2\x80\x99s back-testing performance \nis\xc2\xa0satisfactory.\n\nStressed VaR\nThe purpose of the SVaR is to replicate a VaR calculation \nthat would be generated on the bank\xe2\x80\x99s current portfolio \nwith inputs calibrated to historical data for a continuous \n12-month period of significant financial stress relevant to \nthe bank\xe2\x80\x99s portfolio. To calculate the SVaR, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO \nuses the same model as used for the VaR (historical \nsimulation). The current historical data period includes \nthe\xc2\xa0peak of the credit crisis of 2008 and is reviewed \nat\xc2\xa0least annually.\n\nIncremental Risk Charge\nBy calculating the Incremental Risk Charge (IRC), \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO calculates an estimate of the default and \nmigration risks for credit products in the trading book over \na one-year capital horizon, with a 99.9% confidence level. \nPotential profits and losses over the one-year time horizon \nare created by simulating scenarios showing how the \nissuer\xe2\x80\x99s credit ratings may change (including possible \ndefaults), taking correlations between different issuers \ninto account, and repricing the positions. The simulated \nscenarios correspond to an instantaneous shock over the \none-year period; in this way, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO uses a one-year \nliquidity horizon for all its positions under the scope of the \nIRC model. Rating transitions and defaults are dependent \nupon individual issuer rating transition probabilities and \ncorrelations between issuer migrations. For the individual \ntransition matrices, data from external vendors are used. \nThe correlation matrices are the same as the matrices \nused to determine the Credit Risk Economic Capital.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadershipGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceLeadership & governanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherRisk, funding & capital\x0cRisk, funding & capital  /  Risk, funding & capital\xc2\xa0management  /  Market risk management\n\n54\n\nStress testing and scenario analysis\nStress testing and scenario analysis are designed to focus \nspecifically on the impact of tail events which are outside \nthe VaR confidence interval. We perform daily stress tests \nfor large movements in risk factors. Scenario analyses \nare\xc2\xa0also conducted frequently to evaluate the impacts \nof\xc2\xa0extreme market events that cover multiple risk factors, \nand the results of these tests are monitored. These scenarios \ncan be based either on historical or hypothetical events, \nor\xc2\xa0on a combination of the two.\n\nCapital for market risk in the trading book\nRegulatory capital\nThe bank has implemented the Internal Models Approach \n(IMA) to calculate market risk capital for its trading book. \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO has excluded the following activities from \nits IMA capital and calculates these by means of the \nstandardised approach:\n \xc3\x85 Trading activities in Brazil;\n \xc3\x85 Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Trading;\n \xc3\x85 Private Banking International activities.\n\nFor the trading book, we take into account adjustments for \ncounterparty risk on our clients (Credit Valuation Adjustment), \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xc2\xa0funding costs (Funding Valuation Adjustment) \nand ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xc2\xa0credit\xc2\xa0risk (Debt Valuation Adjustment).\n\nEconomic capital\nCalculation of economic capital for market risk in the \ntrading book is based on a daily Value-at-Risk (VaR) \nmarket\xc2\xa0risk measure and historical scenarios simulating \nstress events such as \xe2\x80\x98Black Monday\xe2\x80\x99 and the financial \nmarkets crisis.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership structureGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceLeadership & governanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherRisk, funding & capital\x0cRisk, funding & capital  /  Risk, funding & capital\xc2\xa0management  /  Operational risk management\n\n55\n\nOperational risk management x\n\nOperational risk is defined as the risk of loss resulting \nfrom inadequate or failed internal processes, people or \nsystems or from external events. This definition is in line \nwith the definition by the Basel Committee on Banking \nSupervision. Operational risk is often also referred to \ninternally as non-financial risk, covering risks such as \nHR\xc2\xa0risk, IT risk, compliance risk, legal risk, change risk, \ntax\xc2\xa0risk and model risk.\xc2\xa0\n\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO has a converged approach to operational risk \nand aims to provide the business with a clear and fair view \non the operational risks that the bank faces and the way \nthese should be managed. For this purpose, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO \nhas in place a framework that enables operational risks to \nbe managed within the moderate risk profile. Operational \nrisk management sets the framework for the bank in line \nwith the requirements for the Advanced Measurement \nApproach (AMA). It evolves and is kept up-to-date as \nexperience gained is incorporated.\n\nFramework for operational risk management v\n\nOperational risk management approach v\nEmployees are expected and encouraged to be alert to \nand aware of operational risks in their day-to-day work. \nOperational risk management is strongly embedded in daily \nbusiness processes. First-line managers are responsible \nfor managing operational risks and are supported by a \nprofessional operational risk management organisation. \nOperational risk management works in close cooperation \nwith other second-line parties, including Compliance, Legal, \nCrime & Integrity, Information Security and Business \nContinuity Management, which also use the operational \n\nrisk framework.\xc2\xa0This reflects the bank\xe2\x80\x99s view that managing \noperational risk requires a concerted effort on the part \nof\xc2\xa0all these departments.\n\nOperational risk is incorporated into risk reports at various \nlevels within the bank, up to the Executive Board and \nSupervisory Board.\n\nFramework for operational risk management   \nv2\nAssessments and monitoring activities are at the heart \nof\xc2\xa0the operational risk management framework. Business \nmanagers use assessments to identify and assess risks, \nincluding scenarios for rare events. Assessments are \nexecuted for business-as-usual activities and for new \ninitiatives. If a risk exceeds the risk appetite, the business \nmanager takes appropriate action. At least once a year, \nbusiness managers monitor the effectiveness of the controls \nin their area of responsibility. Controls are strengthened, \nif\xc2\xa0necessary. Key Risk Indicators are monitored to signal \nadverse risk developments. Despite all the preventive \nmeasures in place, incidents and operational losses cannot \nalways be avoided. The bank therefore systematically \ncollects information and analyses such events in order \nto\xc2\xa0take appropriate action. Action taken may consist of \nmitigating risks by strengthening controls or avoiding risks \nby closing down or not starting operations. Management \ncan also decide to consciously accept a certain risk or \ntransfer a risk to insurance companies. A global insurance \nprogramme is in place, and this is reviewed annually by \nthe Group Risk Committee.\n\nOnce a year, senior management reviews the strategic \nbusiness objectives and all measures taken from a risk \nperspective. At the end of each year, and based on these \nstrategic risk assessments, senior management signs \na\xc2\xa0Management Control Statement, which is included \nat\xc2\xa0the end of this section.\n\nSpecific operational risk areas v\nThe bank has in place a dedicated organisation for \noperational risk areas that require specific knowledge, \nsuch as information security and business continuity \nmanagement.\n\nInformation security\xc2\xa0\nInformation is one of the bank\xe2\x80\x99s most valuable assets. \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s clients rely on the proper functioning of \nthe\xc2\xa0bank\xe2\x80\x99s information systems. These systems run in \ncomplex information infrastructures, connecting the bank\xe2\x80\x99s \nnetworks to public networks. Banking processes and \ntheir\xc2\xa0supporting information systems are consequently \ninherently vulnerable, with the result that the security \nof\xc2\xa0client data and services can be threatened. \n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadershipGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherManagement Control Statement Business-as-usual  (including scenarios) Changes Operational risk events Effectiveness of controls  Key Risk IndicatorsOperational risk assessmentsStrategic risk assessmentOperational risk management overviewMonitoringOperational risk responses  Operational risk appetite  Reporting   Operational risk capital  Mitigation  Avoidance   Transfer Risk acceptanceIntroductionStrategy and performanceLeadership & governanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherRisk, funding & capital\x0cRisk, funding & capital  /  Risk, funding & capital\xc2\xa0management  /  Operational risk management\n\n56\n\nExamples\xc2\xa0of\xc2\xa0such threats include computer-assisted \nfraud,\xc2\xa0unauthorised disclosure of confidential information, \nvirus infections, computer hacking and denial of service \nattacks (DDoS).\n\nIn recognition of the importance of protecting the bank\xe2\x80\x99s \ninformation and its associated assets, such as systems \nand infrastructure, at all times, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO has established \na structured information security approach to ensure the \nconfidentiality, integrity and availability of information.

The resulting estimates are used as \ndata\xc2\xa0input for the model. In these scenarios, experts \ntake\xc2\xa0into consideration the quality of the bank\xe2\x80\x99s control \nenvironment, its processes, systems and people as well \nas external circumstances and changes that may have an \ninfluence. The current relevance of the estimations (and \nhence of the capital) is safeguarded by reconsidering the \nscenarios regularly, but also when major changes in the \nrisk profile occur.

There are two types of \nliquidity risk:\n \xc3\x85 Funding liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to \n\naccommodate both expected and unexpected current \nand future cash outflows and collateral needs because \ninsufficient cash is available. Eventually, this can affect \nthe bank\xe2\x80\x99s daily operations or its financial condition;\n \xc3\x85 Market liquidity risk is the risk that the bank cannot \n\nsell an asset in a timely manner at a reasonable market \nprice due to insufficient market depth (insufficient \nsupply and demand) or market disruption. Market \nliquidity risk includes the sensitivity in liquidity value \nof\xc2\xa0a portfolio due to changes in the applicable haircuts \nand market value. It also concerns uncertainty about the \ntime required to realise the liquidity value of the assets.\n\nStrategy 4ia\nLiquidity\nWe have a liquidity risk management framework in place \nthat helps us maintain a moderate risk profile and safeguards \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s reputation from a liquidity perspective. \nThis\xc2\xa0framework enables the bank to meet the regulatory \nrequirements and its payment obligations at a reasonable \ncost, even under severely adverse conditions. We have \nformulated a set of liquidity risk metrics and limits to \nmanage the bank\xe2\x80\x99s liquidity position. By maintaining a \nsmooth long-term maturity profile, limiting dependence \non\xc2\xa0wholesale funding and holding a solid liquidity buffer in \nour main currencies, we maintain a prudent liquidity profile.\n\nFunding\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s main source of funding consists of deposits \nfrom Retail Banking, Private Banking, Commercial Banking \nand CIB clients. The remainder of our funding is raised \nlargely through various long-term wholesale funding \ninstruments. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s strategy for wholesale funding \nis derived from the bank\xe2\x80\x99s moderate risk profile. This \nstrategy aims to optimise and diversify the bank\xe2\x80\x99s funding \nsources in order to maintain market access and the \ntargeted funding position. We aim to have a balance sheet \nwith a diverse, stable and cost-efficient funding base. \n \nThe funding strategy takes into account the following \nguidelines:\n \xc3\x85 Maintain market access by diversifying funding sources \n\nin different funding markets (Europe, the US and \nthe\xc2\xa0Asia Pacific region);\n\n \xc3\x85 Optimise funding costs within the targets set for \n\nvolumes and maturities;\n\n \xc3\x85 Maintain strong relationships with the investor base \n\nthrough active marketing;\n\n \xc3\x85 Optimise the balance between private placements \n\nand\xc2\xa0public benchmark deals;\n\n \xc3\x85 Build, maintain and manage credit curves in different \n\nfunding programmes and currencies;\n\n \xc3\x85 Continually monitor attractive funding opportunities for \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO and investment opportunities for investors;\n\n \xc3\x85 Optimise the planning and execution of funding in \n\ndifferent market windows and currencies.\n\nRisk management approach   \nbv2i\nThe natural maturity mismatch between loans and funding \nrequires liquidity risk management. We consider maturity \ntransformation to be an integral part of the bank\xe2\x80\x99s business \nmodel, which is why we closely monitor our liquidity \nposition and the resulting risks. We diversify our funding \nsources to maintain market access, and we diversify \nfunding tenors to avoid a concentration of outflows. \nWe\xc2\xa0also hold a portfolio of highly liquid assets that \ncan\xc2\xa0be\xc2\xa0converted into cash in the event of unforeseen \nmarket disruptions, thus allowing us to meet payment \nand\xc2\xa0collateral obligations at all times. \n \n    Funding and liquidity risk is managed centrally. \nWe\xc2\xa0incorporate liquidity costs into the pricing of our  \nday-to-day business activities. \n \n     In managing the risks, a clear distinction is made between \ngoing-concern and contingency risk management.\n\nGoing-concern management\nGoing-concern management entails management of \nthe\xc2\xa0day-to-day liquidity position within specified limits. \nThis\xc2\xa0allows us to meet payment obligations on a timely \nbasis. The most important metrics we use are:\n \xc3\x85 Stress testing: We conduct monthly and ad hoc stress \ntests in which we evaluate the impact of cash in- and \noutflows under plausible stress scenarios. Both market-\nwide and bank-specific stress scenarios are defined \nand analysed. The goal of stress testing is twofold. \nFirstly, it helps us to review our risk framework, \ni.e. the\xc2\xa0liquidity buffer size, risk appetite and limits. \nSecondly, it allows us to identify ways to reduce \noutflows in times of crisis;\n\n \xc3\x85 Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR): The objective of the \nLCR is to assess the bank\xe2\x80\x99s short-term resilience by \nensuring sufficient high-quality liquid assets to survive \na\xc2\xa0significant stress scenario lasting 30 calendar days;\n \xc3\x85 Survival period: The survival period reflects the period \nthat the bank\xe2\x80\x99s liquidity position is expected to remain \npositive in an internal stress scenario in which wholesale \nfunding markets deteriorate and retail and commercial \nclients withdraw a proportion of their deposits;\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadershipGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceLeadership & governanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherRisk, funding & capital\x0cRisk, funding & capital  /  Risk, funding & capital\xc2\xa0management  /  Funding & liquidity risk management\n\n58\n\n \xc3\x85 Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR): The objective of \n\nthe\xc2\xa0NSFR is to assess resilience over a longer time \nhorizon by creating additional incentives for banks \nto\xc2\xa0fund their activities from\xc2\xa0stable sources of funding \non an ongoing basis;\n\n \xc3\x85 Loan-to-Deposit ratio (LtD): The LtD ratio measures \nthe relationship between the loan book (Loans and \nadvances to\xc2\xa0customers) and deposits from clients (Due \nto customers). The ratio includes all client-driven loans \nand deposits, but excludes loans to and deposits from \ngovernments. The LtD ratio gives an indication of our \ndependence on wholesale funding for financing client \nloans. Due to the mandatory and collective Dutch \npension savings schemes, mortgage loans outweigh \nclient savings balances in the Netherlands, thus driving \nthe LtD ratio above 100%.\n\nContingency risk management v\nContingency risk management aims to ensure that, \nin\xc2\xa0the\xc2\xa0event of either a bank-specific or general market \nstress event, the bank is able to generate sufficient \nliquidity to\xc2\xa0withstand a short- or long-term liquidity crisis.\n\n \xc3\x85 Contingency Funding Plan: The Contingency Funding \nPlan (CFP) sets out the guidelines and responsibilities \nfor addressing possible liquidity shortfalls in emergency \nsituations. This only comes into effect if the liquidity \nposition is threatened, or if strong indications exist that \nliquidity stress is imminent. The CFP is aligned with the \nRecovery Plan, as required by the regulators. It enables \nus to manage our liquidity without unnecessarily \njeopardising business lines, while limiting excessive \nfunding costs in severe market circumstances;\n\n \xc3\x85 Collateral posting in the event of a rating downgrade: \nIf ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s credit rating is downgraded, collateral \nrequirements may increase. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO monitors \nthese potential additional collateral postings in its \nliquidity management framework;\n\n \xc3\x85 Liquidity buffer: ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO holds a liquidity buffer \nto\xc2\xa0accommodate\xc2\xa0cash outflows during stress. This \nbuffer consists of unencumbered, high-quality liquid \nassets, including government bonds, retained securities \n(RMBS\xc2\xa0and Covered Bonds) and cash.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership structureGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceLeadership & governanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherRisk, funding & capital\x0cRisk, funding & capital  /  Risk, funding & capital\xc2\xa0management  /  Capital management\n\n59\n\nCapital management\n\nCapital management strategy v4w\nThe primary objective of the capital management strategy \nis to ensure that capital adequacy requirements are met at \nall times and that sufficient capital is available to support \nthe bank\xe2\x80\x99s strategy. Capital is a necessary resource \nfor\xc2\xa0doing business and defines the bank\xe2\x80\x99s commercial \npossibilities. The balance between available and required \ncapital is managed centrally to optimise the use of \navailable capital. The basis of the capital management \nstrategy is the bank\xe2\x80\x99s risk appetite and its business plans. \nOther important factors taken into account when \nmanaging the capital position are expectations and \nrequirements of external stakeholders (such as regulators, \ninvestors, shareholders, equity analysts, rating agencies \nand clients), the bank\xe2\x80\x99s position in the market, market \ndevelopments, contingent capital needs and the feasibility \nof capital management actions. Although ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO \nmanages its capital centrally, the group companies are \nsufficiently capitalised to comply with all local regulatory \nsolvency requirements and to meet any local business \nneeds. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s banking activities are carried out \nby\xc2\xa0legal entities that are part of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s corporate \ntax\xc2\xa0unit. Apart from prevailing statutory and regulatory \nlegislation, there are no specific material impediments \nfor\xc2\xa0prompt transfer of the bank\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory capital.\n\nDividend\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s dividend policy takes into account \nmatters\xc2\xa0including current and pending regulatory capital \nrequirements, our risk profile, growth in commercial \nactivities and market factors. The dividend payout is set in \nthe light of the bank\xe2\x80\x99s moderate risk profile and regulatory \nchanges and to ensure that dividend payments can be \nmaintained in the future.\n\nCapital measurement and allocation\nCapital adequacy is measured and monitored on an \nongoing basis against target capital ratios, which are \nderived from the bank\xe2\x80\x99s overall risk appetite and strategy. \nCapital projections and stress test scenarios, both market-\nwide and bank-specific, are used to ensure that actual \nand\xc2\xa0future capital levels remain above the targets. \nCapital\xc2\xa0is allocated to businesses in a way that optimises \nthe long-term value of the bank while serving the bank\xe2\x80\x99s \nstrategic objectives. In the capital allocation process, \nboth\xc2\xa0risk-based and non-risk-based return parameters are \nconsidered, taking into account economic and regulatory \ncapital requirements. This process ensures that the bank \nmeets its return targets while maintaining a moderate risk \nprofile, in line with the bank\xe2\x80\x99s risk appetite.\n\nContingency capital management\nContingency plans are in place to address any capital \nissues arising. The Contingency Capital Plan provides a \nframework to detect capital adequacy stress by setting \nout various early warning indicators. The plan also sets \nout\xc2\xa0a range of actions that can be undertaken, based \non\xc2\xa0the level of severity and urgency of the issues.\n\nRecovery and resolution planning\nThe Bank Recovery & Resolution Directive requires a \nrecovery plan and a resolution plan to be in place for \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO submitted a reviewed and \nupdated version of its group recovery plan to the ECB \nin\xc2\xa0December 2018. The Single Resolution Board (SRB) \nhas\xc2\xa0prepared a resolution plan for ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO. The SRB \nhas concluded that the preferred resolution strategy \nfor\xc2\xa0ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO is a Single-Point-of-Entry (SPE) strategy, \nwith ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xc2\xa0Bank\xc2\xa0N.V. as the resolution entity. \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO expects to continue issuing external MREL-\neligible instruments through ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xc2\xa0Bank\xc2\xa0N.V.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadershipGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceLeadership & governanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherRisk, funding & capital\x0cRisk, funding & capital  /  Risk, funding & capital\xc2\xa0management  /  Business risk management\n\n60\n\nBusiness risk management\n\nEconomic capital for business risk\nEconomic capital is used to mitigate the negative effects \nof unexpected business risk events. The economic capital \nfor business risk reflects the maximum downward deviation \nof actual versus expected net operating profit in one year.\n\nTo determine the economic capital for business risk, a \ncombination of historical and forward-looking scenarios \nis\xc2\xa0collected from experts in each business line. These \nscenarios determine the sensitivity of macroeconomic \nvariables or industry performance indicators to the business \nlines\xe2\x80\x99 income. This sensitivity is used to determine the \nvolatility of income for each business line, as well as any \ncorrelation between them. Based on the individual volatilities, \nwe use simulation to calculate bank-wide volatility.\n\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO manages business risk in order to preserve \nits business earnings, independent of external or other \ndevelopments. Business risk management limits the \neffects of changes in actual and forecasted business \nearnings. Earnings are affected by various internal and \nexternal factors, such as changes in client preferences, \ncompetition, and economic and geopolitical developments \nand regulations. We continually monitor and respond \nto\xc2\xa0these factors.\n\nThe key criteria for classifying a risk as a business risk are:\n \xc3\x85 An event that leads to uncertainty in present or future \n\nbusiness earnings and/or franchise value;\n\n \xc3\x85 Changes of drivers of future business earnings \n\nsuch as\xc2\xa0uncertainty in volumes, margins, fee and \ncommission rates and/or business expenses.\n\nThe bank mitigates sensitivity to business risk drivers \nthrough management practices that address developments \nin these drivers in an effective and timely manner. \nBusiness risk is also mitigated by a capital buffer.\n\nThe bank\xe2\x80\x99s strategy and business risk are related. \nThe\xc2\xa0strategy incorporates mitigation of uncertain events \nand business risk drivers. Annual review of the strategy \nensures alignment with business risk developments. \nTo\xc2\xa0ensure that the bank\xe2\x80\x99s strategy is pursued and the \nstrategic goals are met in the long term, our business \nplans and budgets take these strategic goals into account.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership structureGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceLeadership & governanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherRisk, funding & capital\x0cRisk, funding & capital  /  Risk, funding & capital\xc2\xa0management  /  Sustainability risk management\n\n61\n\nSustainability risk management\n\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO aims to make a positive contribution to \nsafeguarding human rights, health and safety, and the \nenvironment through its financing and investment services. \nWe recognise, however, that in our roles as lender and \ninvestor, the bank may be exposed to sustainability risks, \nthrough the direct activities of our clients and the companies \nin which we invest on behalf of\xc2\xa0our clients, and through \nthe activities performed in the\xc2\xa0value chains of these \ncompanies. To manage these sustainability risks, we have \ndefined a specific risk appetite in line with the bank\xe2\x80\x99s \nmoderate risk profile.\n\ncommitments to achieve a material positive impact \nfor\xc2\xa0people (potentially) facing adverse human rights \nimpacts in connection with our products and services. \nWe\xc2\xa0organised human rights training sessions for \nemployees to better embed the understanding of human \nrights risks and the leverage we can use, and thus prevent \nor mitigate these risks. We prolonged our public-private \ncooperation with the Inspectorate SZW and the University \nof Amsterdam to proactively detect labour exploitation \nusing knowledge-sharing, data analysis, open-source \nresearch and transaction analysis.       \n\nSustainability risk policy framework\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO uses a sustainability risk policy framework \nwhich is governed according to the bank\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98three lines \nof\xc2\xa0defence\xe2\x80\x99 model. The policy framework covers activities \nranging from corporate lending and payment and \ninvestment services to procurement, human resources \nand product development.\n\nOur sustainability risk policy framework is constantly \nevolving: we develop new policies or adjust existing ones \nbased on feedback and input from stakeholders. \nThe\xc2\xa0bank\xe2\x80\x99s Exclusion List was updated in December 2018. \nIt\xc2\xa0contains our \xe2\x80\x98red lines\xe2\x80\x99, criteria we use to decide when \nto engage with, or when to exclude, a client. In 2017, the \nbank decided to stop lending to tobacco manufacturers. \nIn\xc2\xa02018, we decided to also exclude other companies \nin\xc2\xa0the tobacco value chain when revenues from these \nactivities exceed 50% of the consolidated turnover. \nOther\xc2\xa0exclusions were aligned with the existing relevant \ninternational standards, such as CITES and UNGPs, or \nthose formulated by UNESCO and IUCN. The separate \nsector policies have been merged into one sustainability \nrisk policy with sector requirements. New chapters on \nChemicals & Pharma and Transportation were added \nand\xc2\xa0the chapter on Metals & Minerals has undergone \na\xc2\xa0comprehensive update. The human rights criteria are \ntailored to the salient issues in the sector.\n\nHuman rights\nOne of the focus areas of our sustainability risk policy \nframework is managing human rights risks in accordance \nwith the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human \nRights. In line with these principles, we have integrated \nhuman rights assessment criteria into our lending, \ninvestment and corporate procurement activities. Our \nfocus areas are discrimination, privacy, labour rights and \nland-related human rights.\n\nIn 2018, we contributed to working groups for the \nimplementation of the Dutch Banking Sector Agreement \non international responsible business conduct regarding \nhuman rights. This sector agreement includes \n\nClient and investment management \nClient acceptance is crucial to our approach to managing \nsustainability risks. We have in place instruments to identify \npotential breaches of our sustainability policies and we \ndo\xc2\xa0not do business with companies not willing or able \nto\xc2\xa0run their business responsibly. Similar checks on \nexclusions and controversies apply to the investment \nuniverse provided to our clients via our investment services.\n\nIn corporate lending, the bank performs a sustainability \nassessment for transactions entailing an increased \nsustainability risk. This assessment is based on the ESE \nstandards in our sustainability risk policy framework and \nfocuses on our clients\xe2\x80\x99 compliance, commitment, capacity \nand track record in terms of managing its sustainability risk. \nThis means that we may decide to accept transactions \nwith a high sustainability risk profile, as long as our client \nis capable of managing these risks and operates within the \nlimits of our sustainability sector policies and procedures.\n\nIn 2018, we continued to integrate this assessment into \nour credit application systems by further implementing our \nGlobal Sustainability Risk Indicator (GSRI). Corporate and \nInstitutional Banking started using this assessment tool \nin\xc2\xa0the second quarter of 2018. We also introduced a \nnew\xc2\xa0dashboard to provide clients with feedback on their \nsustainability performance and opportunities for improving \ntheir performance. Our ambition is to further develop the \nGSRI tool to enhance the way we rate our clients\xe2\x80\x99 \nsustainability performance and use the results for our \nmonitoring and reporting, and to perform portfolio analysis.\n\nClient engagement \nIn order not to just manage risk, but also to use our leverage \nto positively affect our relationships with our clients, \nbusiness partners and companies that clients can invest \nin, we strive for an inclusive approach. Most companies \nmeet our sustainability policy requirements. In certain \ninstances, a company might not meet our requirements \n(yet), either prior to or during the relationship. In these \ncases we enter into a dialogue with the company \nin\xc2\xa0question. \n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadershipGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceLeadership & governanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherRisk, funding & capital\x0cRisk, funding & capital  /  Risk, funding & capital\xc2\xa0management  /  Sustainability risk management\n\n62\n\nThe goal of such a dialogue or engagement is to improve \nthe sustainability performance of our clients, so that they \n\xe2\x80\x93 at the very least \xe2\x80\x93 meet ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s sustainability \nstandards. Underperformers are not excluded immediately, \nbut they do have to be willing and able to enter into a \nresults-oriented process, as the success of engagement \ndepends on this commitment. We set a maximum term \nwithin which improvements must take place. Typically, \nthis\xc2\xa0is three years, but in certain cases an extension is \npossible \xe2\x80\x93 for instance when substantial improvements \nhave been made and full compliance is within reach; \nthe\xc2\xa0maximum term of engagement is always determined \non\xc2\xa0a\xc2\xa0case-by-case basis. Disengagement, although a last \nresort, may be an outcome of the process.\n\nEngagement is triggered by:\n \xc3\x85 for clients: actual or potential breaches of our ESG \n\nrisk\xc2\xa0policy framework;\n\n \xc3\x85 for companies in our investment universe: breaches \n\nof the UN Global Compact. Investment universe \nengagement is done in collaboration with Robeco, \nunless the company is also our client.\n\nOur engagement leverage for companies we finance \ndiffers from companies our clients invest in. If we finance \na company, there is usually potential for direct engagement. \nIf not, or if for instance we are part of a loan syndicate \nwith other banks, engagement may be performed by a \nthird party. The engagement procedure is overseen by \na\xc2\xa0team from the relevant business line and the bank\xe2\x80\x99s \nsustainability advisors. Progress reports are drafted \non\xc2\xa0a\xc2\xa0quarterly basis and the Executive Board is informed \nat least once a year.\n\nWe encourage clients to address negative ESG impacts. \nHowever, we can rarely be sure there is a causal relationship \nbetween engaging with our clients and the actions these \nclients subsequently take to improve their management \nof\xc2\xa0ESG issues. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO is often one voice among \na\xc2\xa0diverse group of stakeholders who pursue the same \nobjective through different means. Where possible, given \nclient confidentiality and other constraints, we try to \ncooperate with external stakeholders in order to maximise \npositive impact.\n\nCarbon accounting\nOur policies and targets apply to the transition to a low-\ncarbon economy, and we also expect our focus on the \ncircular economy and sustainable assets to have a positive \nimpact. At the end of 2018, we started a project designed \nto make this effect more measurable. \n\nWe want to raise the energy performance of all buildings \nfinanced by ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO to energy label \xe2\x80\x98A\xe2\x80\x99 (on average) by \n2030. Our progress on this target is shown in the Strategy \n& performance section. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO wants to ensure \ncompliance with Dutch regulations aimed at obtaining \n\nat\xc2\xa0least energy label \xe2\x80\x98C\xe2\x80\x99 on all Dutch office buildings \nby\xc2\xa02023. Our progress is reported according to the PCAF \nmethod for carbon accounting.\n\nTogether with other Dutch financial institutions, \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO participates in the Platform Carbon \nAccounting for Financials (PCAF). PCAF is part of the \nDutch Sustainable Finance Platform, which is chaired \nby\xc2\xa0the Dutch central bank (DNB). PCAF\xe2\x80\x99s objective is \nto\xc2\xa0improve carbon accounting by increasing transparency \nand uniformity in carbon footprinting and target-setting \nin\xc2\xa0the financial sector. PCAF intends to contribute to \nthe\xc2\xa0development of a harmonised framework for science-\nbased targets and has developed a methodology for \nmeasuring the carbon footprint of investments and loans. \nThe methodology enables financial institutions to align \ntheir portfolios better with climate scenarios.\n\nRecommendations for climate-related \nfinancial\xc2\xa0disclosures\nIn September 2018 the Task Force on Climate-related \nFinancial Disclosures of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) \npublished its status report on the adoption of the TCFD \ndisclosure framework. This report concluded that the risk-\nreturn profile of companies exposed to climate-related risks \nmay change significantly as a result of the physical impacts \nof climate change, climate policy or new technologies.\n\nIn 2018, DNB performed an energy transition stress test \nfor the financial system in the Netherlands. The results \nshowed that in the event of a disruptive energy transition \nthe losses for financial institutions would be sizeable yet \nmanageable. To make them manageable, DNB advises \nfinancial institutions to include energy transition risks in \ntheir risk management policies. In addition, the European \nCommission unveiled its strategy for a financial system \nthat supports the EU\xe2\x80\x99s climate and sustainable development \nagenda. The European Commission is developing guidelines \nwith regard to matters such as taxonomy, EU labels for green \nfinancial products and metrics for measuring progress \ntowards a low-carbon economy and will publish these \nguidelines in the coming years. The EU non-financial \nreporting directive is expected to be aligned with the \nTCFD requirements (as part of the 2019 revision).\n\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO supports the TCFD\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations and \nbelieves their widespread adoption will lead to a more \ninformed dialogue on climate-related risks and opportunities \nfor our clients, investors and other stakeholders.\n\nThe carbon accounting activities described in this report \n(PCAF, carbon risk implementation), together with our \nCarbon Disclosure Project (CDP) reporting on scopes 1 \nand 2 of our greenhouse gas emissions, constitute the \nfirst steps ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO has taken towards implementing \nthe TCFD recommendations.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership structureGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceLeadership & governanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherRisk, funding & capital\x0cRisk, funding & capital  /  Risk, funding & capital\xc2\xa0management  /  Management Control Statement\n\n63\n\nManagement Control Statement\n\n \xc3\x85 The Executive Board\xe2\x80\x99s report states those material \n\nrisks and uncertainties that are relevant to expectations \nregarding ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s continuity for the period of \ntwelve months after preparation of this report.\n\nRegarding internal risk management and control systems, \nthe Executive Board has identified the following external \nfactors as potentially having an impact on ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s \ncurrent business model:\n \xc3\x85 Limitations in the execution of the planned sustainable \n\ngrowth strategies due to adverse macroeconomic \nand\xc2\xa0monetary conditions (i.e. sustained low or negative \ninterest rates) and geopolitical uncertainty (such as the \nimpact of Brexit, trade tensions and sanctions).\n\n \xc3\x85 Various laws and regulations (revised or otherwise) \n\nmay\xc2\xa0have an impact on ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s strategic position \nand capital adequacy.\n\nThese external factors may impact specific businesses \nor\xc2\xa0business models, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s positioning vis-\xc3\xa0-vis its \ncompetitors (including fintechs, big techs and institutional \ninvestors) or the level playing field in the financial sector, \nthus hindering ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO in achieving its strategic goals. \n\xc2\xa0 \nNot being compliant with laws and regulations may \nlead to\xc2\xa0reputational damage, fines and changes in \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s income and cost basis or endanger long-\nterm goals. Ensuring demonstrable compliance, both in \nbusiness-as-usual activities and in line with changes in \nregulatory requirements, requires robust risk governance \nand\xc2\xa0a\xc2\xa0substantial share of the bank\xe2\x80\x99s resources. \n \nSpecific areas where the risk of non-compliance with \nregulations requires substantial efforts by the bank are:\n \xc3\x85 Customer Due Diligence/KnowYourClient,  \n\nAnti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorism \nFinancing (CTF) \nGiven the increased regulatory attention and \nrequirements\xc2\xa0for the prevention of anti-money \nlaundering and the regulatory and self-identified \nshortcomings in AML-CTF and CDD/KYC processes \nthat are currently subject to improvement programmes, \nfurther significant management attention for CDD/KYC \nand for improvements of the AML control framework \nwill be required.\n\nUnder Principle 1.4 (Risk management accountability) of \nthe Dutch Corporate Governance Code of December 2016, \nABN AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s Executive Board is requested to render account \nof the effectiveness of the bank\xe2\x80\x99s design and\xc2\xa0operation \nof\xc2\xa0its internal risk management and control\xc2\xa0systems.       \n\nABN AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s internal risk management and control is a \nprocess effectuated by the Executive Board, management \nand other personnel. It is designed to provide reasonable \nassurance regarding the achievement of objectives \nin\xc2\xa0the\xc2\xa0following categories:\n \xc3\x85 Effectiveness and efficiency of operations;\n \xc3\x85 Reliability of financial and non-financial information;\n \xc3\x85 Compliance with laws, regulations and internal policies;\n \xc3\x85 Safeguarding of assets, and identification and \n\nmanagement of liabilities, and;\n\n \xc3\x85 Strategic and business objectives of ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO.\n\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s first and second lines of defence perform \ntheir roles in risk assessments, stress tests, evaluations \nof the operating effectiveness of controls, and reporting \non risk management and control.

Management has initiated several \nprogrammes to address the issues in conjunction with \nrequirements following from upcoming regulations \nand heightened regulatory expectations, e.g. in relation \nto Regulatory Technical Standards, new Definition \nof Default and feedback from Targeted Reviews \nof\xc2\xa0Internal Models.\n\nIn addition to the significant programmes that are in place, \nthe above mentioned regulatory compliance risk is \nmitigated by sustaining and enhancing staff awareness \nwith regard to regulatory programmes through ongoing \ntraining and presentations. Additional staff and budget \nhave been made available to address regulatory change \ninitiatives. Executive management closely monitors the \nprogress of remediation programmes.\n\nThe Executive Board has identified and agreed upon the \nfollowing areas of improvement, which are being actively \nmanaged by senior management:\n \xc3\x85 The bank has to meet requirements in the field of \n\ndata aggregation and risk reporting which requires a \nsubstantial effort. These aspects of data management, \ncombined with issues around data quality and data \nknowledge, may result in suboptimal decision making \nand business process execution, as well as elevated \nmodel risk and missed opportunities in the application \nof new technologies. Although progress has been \nmade in many areas, the initiatives still require a  \nmulti-year approach in order to reach the desired level. \n\n \xc3\x85 The bank values its Duty of Care\xc2\xa0towards its clients \n\nand\xc2\xa0will continue to do so. It has programmes in place \nto address issues around products sold in the past, \nsuch as SME derivatives.\n\n \xc3\x85 The complexity, accumulation and interdependencies \nof the various transformation programmes, the fixing \nof\xc2\xa0the foundations of the bank\xe2\x80\x99s IT systems, and \nvarious regulatory and organisational changes, entail \na\xc2\xa0risk that building blocks may not be in place within the \nagreed timeframes. This may result in extra costs and \npotentially in falling behind new entrants not subject to \ncomprehensive regulation. Alignment of these changes \nand their interdependencies is a key attention point.\n\n \xc3\x85 The continued increase and professionalism of external \n\ncrime threats may expose the bank and its clients \nto cyber fraud attacks, ATM attacks, loan frauds and \nIT disruptions. Defence mechanisms against cyber \nthreats are continually being upgraded. ABN AMRO has \nintensified cooperation with crime-fighting authorities \nand is working with authorities and other banks in \nthese areas of attention.\n\n \xc3\x85 As a result of the accelerated use of (public) cloud \n\nproviders and the Revised Payment Services Directive \n(PSD2), growing amounts of privacy-sensitive or \nconfidential data will be stored outside the bank. \nThis may impact the bank\xe2\x80\x99s ability to monitor the \nrisk of data leaks and compliancy with the General \nData Protection Regulation (GDPR). ABN AMRO is \ncontinually strengthening its data leak prevention \ntools and controls, both internally and in liaison with \nexternal parties involved in processing and storing \ndata elements.\n\n \xc3\x85 The ability to attract, train and retain qualified \n\nprofessionals and new talents remains a point of \nattention, as this will enable the achievement of \nthe strategic goals. This risk is mitigated by several \nprogrammes that focus on strategic workforce \nmanagement, culture & leadership, the use of  \nself-steering methods and employer branding. \n\nDue to inherent limitations, ABN AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s internal \nrisk management and control systems do not provide \ncomplete assurance on the realisation of business \nobjectives, and cannot at all times prevent inaccuracies, \nfraud and non-compliance with rules and regulations.       \n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership structureGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceLeadership & governanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherRisk, funding & capital\x0cRisk, funding & capital  /  Risk, funding & capital\xc2\xa0review  /  Risk profile\n\n65\n\nRisk, funding & capital review\n\nThe following section provides a comprehensive overview of the different risks across \nbusiness segments and portfolios.

We monitor risk against our risk\xc2\xa0appetite and \nactively manage the balance sheet composition to this end.\xc2\xa0\n\nRisk profile assessment\nPeriodically, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO assesses its risk profile in \nconjunction with the bank\xe2\x80\x99s risk appetite and strategic \nrisk\xc2\xa0appetite (SRAS). The five elements of the SRAS ensure \na coherent balance between sustainable return and value \ncreation, our business model, capital, and liquidity & \nfunding, taking\xc2\xa0into account a\xc2\xa0sound conduct, governance \nand control framework. This\xc2\xa0 assessment is discussed \nin\xc2\xa0the\xc2\xa0Executive Board and Super  visory Board. Based\xc2\xa0on \nthis assessment we conclude:\n \xc3\x85 Business model, return and value creation \n\nThere is a focus on healthy return by maintaining  \nlong-term risk adjusted return on equity above 10%. \nLimitations in the execution of the planned sustainable \ngrowth strategies due to adverse macro-economic \nand\xc2\xa0monetary conditions (i.e. sustained low/negative \ninterest rates) and geopolitical uncertainty (such as \nthe\xc2\xa0impact of Brexit, trade tensions and sanctions) \ncould\xc2\xa0impact global trade, thus increasing the risk for \ncurrent business and affecting our margins/revenues.     \n\n \xc3\x85 Capital, Liquidity & Funding \n\nComfortable buffers are in place to meet capital and \nliquidity requirements from a regulatory and internal \n(e.g.\xc2\xa0economic capital) perspective. In addition, stress \ntesting indicates sufficient buffers are in place for times \nof\xc2\xa0stress.\n\n \xc3\x85 Conduct, Governance and Control Framework \n\nCapital buffers are in place to cover non-financial \nrisks. In\xc2\xa0managing these risks, we face challenges \nregarding our\xc2\xa0ability to fully comply with all regulatory \nrequirements in 2019.\xc2\xa0Specific areas where the risk of \nnon-compliance with regulations requires a substantial \neffort from the bank are:\n \xc3\x85 Customer Due Diligence/KnowYourClient, Anti-Money \nLaundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorism Financing (CTF);\n\n \xc3\x85 Model management.\n\n \nRegulatory compliance risk is mitigated by ensuring staff \nstays aware of regulatory programmes through ongoing \ntraining and presentations. Furthermore, additional staff \nand budget have been made available for\xc2\xa0regulatory \nchange initiatives.\n\nIn addition, the bank has to meet requirements in the field \nof data aggregation and risk reporting which requires a \nsubstantial effort. These aspects of data management, \ncombined with issues regarding data quality and data \nknowledge, may result in suboptimal decision making and \nbusiness process execution, as well as elevated model \nrisk and missed opportunities in the application of new \ntechnologies. Although progress has been made in many \nareas, the initiatives still require a multi-year approach in \norder to reach the desired level. Given the balance of the \nrisks and mitigating actions that we have in place, our \ncurrent risk profile is considered moderate. \n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadershipGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceLeadership & governanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherRisk, funding & capital\x0cRisk, funding & capital  /  Risk, funding & capital\xc2\xa0review  /  Risk profile\n\n66\n\nBalance sheet composition\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO is mainly active in the Dutch market and in  \ninternational operations where we have specific expertise \nand hold leading positions in selective activities. \n\nBalance sheet composition at 31 December 2018\n\n40%\n\n31%\n\n2%\n3%\n2%\n11%\n\n11%\n\nResidential\nmortgages\nOther loans\nto customers\nLoans to banks\nSecurities \xef\xac\x81nancing\nDerivatives\nFinancial\ninvestments\nOther assets\n\n22%\n\n4%\n\n20%\n\n2%\n2%\n4%\n6%\n\n40%\n\nClient deposits\nBank deposits\nLong-term & \nsubordinated debt\nSecurities \xef\xac\x81nancing\nDerivatives\nShort-term debt\nEquity\nOther liabilities\n\nAssets\n\nLiabilities \n& equity \n\nThe balance sheet composition reflects the bank\xe2\x80\x99s \nmoderate risk profile.

Credit risk showed a \nsmaller\xc2\xa0increase as higher RWA due to TRIM and model \nreviews was partly off-set by business movements \nand\xc2\xa0asset quality developments (e.g. lower loan balances \npost\xc2\xa0impairments, improved credit ratings).\n\nEconomic Capital\nEconomic capital (EC) decreased to EUR\xc2\xa015.0\xc2\xa0billion \n(31\xc2\xa0December 2017: 15.2\xc2\xa0billion), driven by lower market \nrisk in the banking book EC (EUR\xc2\xa00.2\xc2\xa0billion) and a \ndecrease in operational risk EC (EUR\xc2\xa00.2\xc2\xa0billion), which \nwas offset by an increase in own funds liquidity risk EC \n(EUR\xc2\xa00.2\xc2\xa0billion). Credit risk EC remained fairly stable \nat\xc2\xa0EUR\xc2\xa08.0\xc2\xa0billion (31\xc2\xa0December 2017: EUR\xc2\xa07.9\xc2\xa0billion).\xc2\xa0\n\nThe decrease in market risk in the banking book EC and \nthe increase in own funds liquidity risk EC was driven by \nasset liability management. The decrease in operational \nrisk EC resulted from model updates. The small increase \nin\xc2\xa0credit risk EC related to Retail Banking.\n\nRecent developments\nThe outcome of the Brexit negotiations is still uncertain \nwhile the deadline is approaching. Our base case scenario \nis still that there will not be a no-deal Brexit. As a European \nbank, headquartered in Amsterdam, we have the resources, \ninfrastructure and contingency plans in place to ensure \nthe\xc2\xa0continuity of our services to clients in Europe and \nbeyond, whatever the outcome of the EU/UK negotiations. \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s direct exposure to the UK is limited. \n\nWe\xc2\xa0have conducted a review of our clients with exposure \nto the UK and have concluded that the direct exposure \nof\xc2\xa0our clients is limited as well. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO remains \ncommitted to minimising any disruption Brexit may cause \nfor its clients, its activities and its staff. The impact of any \nmacro-economic consequences in the event of a no-deal \nBrexit are uncertain. It is therefore difficult to assess the \nindirect impact of Brexit on our clients and value chains.\n\nCredit quality indicators\nThe credit quality indicators were impacted by the write-\noff (EUR\xc2\xa00.4\xc2\xa0billion) of a large part of the fully provisioned \nMadoff file and by additional impairments for specific \nclients in specific sectors. The write-off relating to\xc2\xa0Madoff \nwas recorded as all possible means of recovery had been \nexhausted. Besides these developments, the credit quality \nindicators performed well, in line with the performance of \nthe Dutch economy and housing market. \n\nThe forbearance ratio decreased as more clients \ncompleted their probation period (i.e. were no longer \nforborne), write-offs were recorded and to a lesser extent \nrepayments were made. The impaired and coverage ratio \ndecreased further as a result of clients returning to the \nperforming portfolio and write-offs. In addition, the past \ndue ratio decreased compared with year-end 2017.\n\nCost of risk\nThe cost of risk increased to 24bps for 2018 (2017: -2bps), \nmainly driven by the CB and CIB portfolios. The increase \nin\xc2\xa0the CB portfolio related to industrial goods and services, \nhealthcare and the shipping industry. The CIB portfolio \nshowed higher impairments, primarily related to the \nenergy-offshore, diamonds and shipping industries, which \nwere mainly the result of additional impairments for \nexisting impaired clients. In 2017, impairment charges \nbenefited from significant model releases for SME lending \nand IBNI releases. For more details on impairments, \nplease refer to the loan impairment charges and \nallowances paragraph.\n\nLiquidity and funding \nThe LtD ratio decreased to 111% at 31 December 2018 \n(31 December 2017: 112%), mainly due to\xc2\xa0a EUR\xc2\xa01.8\xc2\xa0billion \ndecline in the residential mortgage book and\xc2\xa0a \nEUR\xc2\xa01.7\xc2\xa0million decline in corporate loans.\n\nReporting scope

Comparative \nfigures as at 1 January 2018 are included in the IFRS 9 \ntransitional disclosures under note 1, Accounting policies.        \nThe IAS 39 impaired ratio has been compared with the \nIFRS 9 stage 3 ratio, because the impaired assets under \nIAS 39 have been classified as stage 3 assets under IFRS \n9. The IAS 39 coverage ratio was calculated by dividing \nthe\xc2\xa0amount of allowances by the impaired exposure. \nUnder IFRS 9, 93% of the loans and advances relates \nto\xc2\xa0stage 1 and 4.9% to stage 2. \n\nThe stage 3 impaired ratio improved and the coverage \nratio decreased for loans and advances to customers at \nyear-end 2018. The coverage ratio was impacted by\xc2\xa0a large \nwrite-off for the fully provisioned Madoff file, which was \n\noffset by additional provisions mainly for existing impaired \nclients in specific industries. If\xc2\xa0the Madoff file had not \nbeen written off, the stage 3 coverage ratio would have \nincreased to 36.2% at year-end 2018.\n\nResidential mortgages and consumer loans benefited \nfrom the strong Dutch economic environment, recording \nlower impaired exposures and lower allowances for \ncredit\xc2\xa0losses, resulting in improved stage 3 ratios and \nlower coverage ratios for stage 3.\n\nImpaired corporate loans declined as a result of write-offs \nand repayments. The decrease in credit loss allowances \nwas partly offset by additional credit losses for specific, \nmainly existing, impaired files in the energy offshore, \ndiamonds and shipping industries in CIB. Additional \ncredit\xc2\xa0losses were recognised in Commercial Banking \nfor\xc2\xa0the healthcare and shipping industries.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and

These charges related \nmainly to specific files in the stage 3 corporate loans \nportfolio, resulting in a cost of risk of 24bps (2017: \ncost\xc2\xa0of\xc2\xa0risk -2bps). The increase in impairments mainly \nrelated to CIB and Commercial Banking.\n\nCommercial Banking recorded net additions of \nEUR\xc2\xa0253\xc2\xa0million in 2018, compared with a net release \nof\xc2\xa0EUR\xc2\xa0179\xc2\xa0million in 2017, mainly reflecting impairment \ncharges in industrial goods & services, healthcare and \nshipping. The remainder was spread across various \nindustry sectors. The release in 2017 was largely \nattributable to model refinement and update, compared \nwith limited releases in 2018.\n\nImpairments charges in CIB increased to EUR\xc2\xa0427\xc2\xa0million \n(2017: EUR\xc2\xa0219\xc2\xa0million). The increase was mainly the \nresult of additional impairments for existing files in the \n\nenergy (mainly off-shore), diamonds, shipping and \ncommodities industries. Additionally, we executed a few \nsecondary sales of our most vulnerable clients in 2018, \nwhich materially mitigated our downside risk in the \noffshore energy market.\n\nResidential mortgages continued to benefit from the \nstrong Dutch economy and housing market, resulting in \na\xc2\xa0release of EUR\xc2\xa011\xc2\xa0million (2017: EUR\xc2\xa049\xc2\xa0million release). \nThe release in 2017 was significantly impacted by a model \nrefinement and IBNI releases.\n\nConsumer loans recorded a limited release of EUR\xc2\xa04\xc2\xa0million, \ncompared with a release of EUR\xc2\xa054\xc2\xa0million in 2017.\n\nOverall, our cost of risk (COR) was 24bps for 2018, below \nthe through-the-cycle COR of 25-30bps and in line with \nour expectations.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadershipGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceLeadership & governanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherRisk, funding & capital\x0cRisk, funding & capital  /  Risk, funding & capital\xc2\xa0review  /  Credit risk\n\n90\n\nForborne, past due and credit impaired loans split by geography and industry\nForborne, past due and credit impaired loans split by geography\n\n(in\xc2\xa0millions)\n\nThe Netherlands\nRest of Europe\nUSA\nAsia\nRest of the world\nTotal On-balance\nOff-balance\nTotal\n\nThe Netherlands\nRest of Europe\nUSA\nAsia\nRest of the world\nTotal On-balance\nOff-balance\nTotal\n\nForborne  \nexposure\n\nExposures past due, \nbut not stage 3\n\nStage 3  \nexposures\n\nAllowances  \nfor stage 3\n\n31 December 2018\nStage 3 charges \nfor the period\n\n4,115\n783\n266\n148\n509\n5,821\n\n5,821\n\n3,170\n332\n2\n3\n69\n3,576\n\n3,576\n\n4,067\n898\n210\n123\n588\n5,887\n180\n6,066\n\n1,200\n318\n100\n88\n158\n1,862\n\n1,862\n\nForborne  \nexposure\n\nExposures past due, \nbut not impaired\n\nImpaired  \nexposures\n\nAllowances for \nimpairments1\n\n5,306\n794\n347\n203\n740\n7,390\n\n7,390\n\n3,625\n356\n\n1\n109\n4,090\n\n4,090\n\n4,315\n912\n276\n117\n1,371\n6,991\n121\n7,112\n\n1,274\n262\n105\n50\n593\n2,285\n\n2,285\n\n297\n130\n45\n79\n119\n670\n-15\n655\n\n31 December 2017\nImpairment \ncharges for  \nthe\xc2\xa0period1\n\n-251\n51\n91\n40\n64\n-4\n\n-4\n\n1  Amounts excluding Incurred But not Identified (IBNI).\n\nThe largest decline in the forborne exposure in 2018 was \nrecorded in the Netherlands and related to decreases in \nCommercial Banking and Retail Banking, which benefited \nfrom the strong domestic economy.

The shortage \nin housing stock was partly the result of home movers \npreferring to buy a new home before putting their current \nproperty up for sale.\n\nResidential mortgage indicators\n\n(in\xc2\xa0millions)\n\nGross carrying amount excluding fair value adjustment from hedge accounting\n- of which Nationale Hypotheek Garantie (NHG)\nFair value adjustment from hedge accounting\nCarrying amount\nExposure at Default 1\nRWA1\nRWA/Exposure at Default\nForbearance ratio\nPast due ratio\nStage 3 ratio\nStage 3 coverage ratio\nCost of risk (in bps) 2\nAverage LtMV (indexed)\nAverage LtMV \xe2\x80\x93 excluding NHG loans (indexed)\nTotal risk mitigation\nTotal risk mitigation/carrying amount\n\n31 December 2018\n\n31 December 2017\n\n148,791\n36,257\n2,101\n148,683\n162,787\n16,853\n10.4%\n0.5%\n1.3%\n0.5%\n10.0%\n-1\n64%\n62%\n228,774\n153.9%\n\n150,562\n38,049\n2,264\n150,428\n165,107\n17,236\n10.4%\n0.8%\n1.6%\n0.7%\n10.9%\n-3\n70%\n67%\n198,739\n132.1%\n\n1  The RWA and Exposure at Default amounts are based on the exposure class Secured by immovable property.

If necessary, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO discusses adjustments \nto the mortgage to make it better suited to what the \nclient\xc2\xa0needs.\n\nCommercial Real Estate (CRE)\nThe Dutch commercial real estate (investment) market \ncontinued to increase in 2018, driven by high demand \nfrom investors. After Germany, the United Kingdom \nand\xc2\xa0France, the Netherlands attracted most investors \nin\xc2\xa0commercial real estate. A total of EUR\xc2\xa020\xc2\xa0billion was \ninvested in 2018, an increase of 2.6% compared with \n2017. Due to ongoing low interest rates, a significant part \nof the investment budget has shifted towards commercial \nreal estate. As fewer investment opportunities are available, \nthe increase in volume is slowing down. Demand for \noffice space is still increasing and the availability of high-\nquality locations is diminishing. Although new construction \nis growing, a lack of building sites at locations with high \ndemand is causing lease prices for offices to rise.\n\nIn 2018, residential assets were the biggest investment \nin\xc2\xa0the Netherlands, the first time ever. The residential \nmarket is in high demand due to increasing housing \nprices, lack of\xc2\xa0new build and changing preferences of \ninhabitants. Urbanisation is causing rents to increase \nmost\xc2\xa0in the largest cities in the Netherlands, but due \nto\xc2\xa0shortage in the housing market, rental fees in other \nparts of the Netherlands increased as well.\n\nCommercial Real Estate portfolio\nIn 2018 the EAD increased 13% to EUR\xc2\xa010.6\xc2\xa0billion \ncompared with year-end 2017. The credit quality indicators \nin 2018 further improved due to the strong commercial \nreal estate market. However, the coverage ratio in 2018 \nwent up to 44% (31 December 2017: 35%) as impaired \nexposures showed a sharper decline than allowances for \nimpairments. The CRE LtV continued to decline, totalling \n49.7% (2017: 53.5%) mainly as a result of rising commercial \nreal estate prices, which are largely based on Dutch \nproperties.

Comparative figures have been adjusted. \n\nActivities in the trading book are sensitive to multiple risk \nfactors. Most assets and liabilities in the banking book are \nsensitive to interest rate risk to a large extent. Some of \nthe assets and liabilities are also sensitive to FX risk; \nhowever, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO minimises this risk through hedging.\n\nMarket risk in the banking book\nMarket risk in the banking book is the risk that the bank\xe2\x80\x99s \nvalue or income declines because of unfavourable market \nmovements. The market risk in the banking book consists \npredominantly of interest rate risk, which arises from \nholding loans with interest rate maturities that are different \nfrom the interest rate maturities of the deposits. The \nassets have a longer average maturity than the liabilities. \nThis applies to contractual as well as behavioural maturities.\n\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO uses a combination of portfolio (macro) \nhedges and specific asset or liability (micro) hedges \nto\xc2\xa0swap fixed interest rates for floating interest rate \npositions. The resulting interest rate positions, after \napplication of interest rate hedges, are in line with \nthe\xc2\xa0bank\xe2\x80\x99s strategy and risk appetite.\n\nInterest rate risk metrics\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO uses NII-at-Risk and duration as the main \nmetrics for managing the interest rate risk.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership structureGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceLeadership & governanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherRisk, funding & capital\x0cRisk, funding & capital  /  Risk, funding & capital\xc2\xa0review  /  Market risk\n\n97\n\nNII-at-Risk\nNII-at-Risk is the difference in net interest income (NII) \nbetween a base scenario and four alternative scenarios. \nIt\xc2\xa0is defined as the worst outcome of the following \nscenarios: gradual increase or decrease in interest rates \nby 200bps and instantaneous increase or decrease of \n100bps. All scenarios are measured over a time horizon \nof\xc2\xa0one year. NII-at-Risk covers all expected cash flows, \nincluding commercial margins and other spread components, \nfrom interest-rate-sensitive assets and liabilities and  \noff-balance sheet items in the banking book. A floor \nof\xc2\xa0-100bps on market rates as well as a floor of 0bps \non\xc2\xa0retail deposits is applied.\n\nDuration\nDuration of equity measures value changes resulting from \nminor parallel shifts of the yield curve. The computation of \nduration is based on a comparison between a base curve \nand the change in the economic value of a portfolio due \nto\xc2\xa0an interest rate increase/decrease. We also measure \nthe value sensitivity to changes in individual maturities \non\xc2\xa0the yield curve.\n\nThe following table shows the interest rate risk metrics \nat\xc2\xa0year-end 2018 and 2017.\n\nNII-at-risk (in %)\nDuration of equity (in years)\n\nThe risk appetite for interest rate risk was lowered in \nthe\xc2\xa0annual review of the risk appetite statement for 2018, \nwhile also anticipating a periodic methodology review \nand\xc2\xa0stricter regulatory testing (supervisory outlier test). \nIn\xc2\xa0addition, the way non-maturing deposits are modelled \nhas been updated to ensure accurate measurement \nand\xc2\xa0management of interest rate risk. Duration of equity \ndecreased from 2.2 to 1.4 years. Although duration of \nequity increased due to business developments and \nthe\xc2\xa0updated non-maturing deposits model, the effect \nwas\xc2\xa0more than offset by active hedging of the portfolio.\n\nThe NII-at-Risk at year-end 2018 increased to -1.3% \n(approximately EUR\xc2\xa0-67\xc2\xa0million), reflecting the impact \non\xc2\xa0NII in the scenario of an instantaneous decrease in \ninterest rates of 100bps. Prior to 2018, NII-at-Risk only \nincluded the scenarios of a gradual increase and decrease \nin interest rates of 200bps. The NII-at-Risk for 2017 \n(-0.5%) reflected a reduction of NII in the scenario of a \ngradual decrease in interest rates. For comparison, the \nimpact of a gradual decrease in interest rates amounted \nto\xc2\xa0-0.4% at year-end 2018. \n\nThe highest NII occurs for the scenario where interest \nrates rise gradually by 200bps, in which NII would increase \nby 7.2% (approximately EUR\xc2\xa0366\xc2\xa0million).\n\n31 December 2018\n\n31 December 2017\n\n-1.3\n1.4\n\n-0.5\n2.2\n\nMarket risk in the trading book\nMarket risk exposure d\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO applies a diversified portfolio VaR approach, \nwhich takes into account the fact that returns across risk \nfactors may offset one another to a certain extent and \nconsequently reduce risk.

The capital position \nstrengthened compared with 31 December 2017, \ndriven\xc2\xa0by profit accumulation and a net RWA decrease. \nAll\xc2\xa0capital ratios were well above the regulatory minimum \nrequirements, and in line with the bank\xe2\x80\x99s risk appetite \nand\xc2\xa0strategic ambitions. At year-end 2018, the fully-\nloaded\xc2\xa0Basel IV CET1 ratio improved to around 13.5%  \n(pre-mitigations). We are developing mitigating actions \nto\xc2\xa0maintain performance under Basel IV and to further \n\nreduce the Basel IV RWA impact. This is expected to \nmitigate approximately 1/5th of the Basel IV RWA inflation \nand will\xc2\xa0raise the estimated Basel IV CET1 ratio above \n14% (post-mitigation). In addition to mitigating actions, \nwe\xc2\xa0are also looking at pricing, new business models \nand\xc2\xa0reducing capital intensive activities. We aim to \nmeet\xc2\xa0the\xc2\xa0fully-loaded Basel IV CET1 requirement early \nin\xc2\xa0the phase-in period, i.e. >13.5%.\n\nThe following chart shows the primary drivers of the Basel III \ncapital ratios in 2018.\n\nDevelopments impacting capital ratios in 2018\n(in %)\n\nEDTF 11\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n21.3\n18.5\n\n17.7\n\n2.2\n\n0.2 \n\n-1.3\n\n0.0\n\n-0.1\n\n0.2\n\n-0.2\n\n22.2\n19.3\n\n18.4\n\n31 December \n\n2017\n\nReported\nnet pro\xef\xac\x81t\n\nRWA \nchanges\n\nDividend\nreserve\n\nAT1\n\nTier 2\n\ninstruments\n\nMinority\ninterests\n\nOther \nchanges\n\n31 December \n\n2018\n\nCommon Equity Tier 1 ratio/Core Tier 1 ratio\n\nTier 1 ratio\n\nTotal capital ratio\n\nOur CET1 capital target range under Basel III was 17.5-18.5% \nfor 2018 and has been reconfirmed for 2019.

ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO reviews \nthe buffer and the capital target annually to reflect possible \ncapital developments such as TRIM and Basel IV. The \ntarget for return on average equity (10-13%) remains \nunchanged under Basel IV. \n\nAt year-end 2018, RWAs included the effects of TRIM and \nmodel reviews including Clearing. We expect regulatory \nheadwinds from capital regulations, the industry-wide \nNon-Performing Exposure (NPE) guidance and model \nreviews (including TRIM), partly offset by progress on the \nCIB refocus. In particular, we expect further increase in \nRWAs in respect of Clearing during 2019 reflecting results \nof model review. TRIM is the regulatory assessment and \nharmonisation of internal RWA models whereas NPE aims \nto ensure the harmonisation of impairment provisioning \nacross EU banks.

Net profit \nafter dividend allocation is included in CET1 capital, in \naccordance with regulations and the dividend policy.\n\nBased on the final SREP, the full phase-in of the systematic \nrisk buffer (from 2.25% in 2018 to 3.0% in 2019) and the \ncapital conservation buffer (from 1.88% in 2018 to 2.5% \nin\xc2\xa02019), the SREP requirement increased from 10.45% in \n2018 to 11.82% in 2019, including a counter-cyclical buffer \nof 0.07%. The maximum distributable amount (MDA) \ntrigger level for ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xc2\xa0Bank\xc2\xa0N.V. has become 11.82% \nof CET1 capital, to be increased by any additional tier 1 \n(AT1) or tier 2 capital shortfall. Due to the minority interest \nrules interpretation of the EBA, there was an AT1 shortfall \nof 0.6% at year-end 2018, as ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xc2\xa0Group\xc2\xa0N.V. \ncannot incorporate all its available AT1 capital. However, \nthe CET1 ratio is comfortably above the MDA trigger level.\n\nThe revised minority interest rule typically impacts on \nbank holding companies with a single subsidiary and a \nhigh level of total capital, as is the case for ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO. \nIt\xc2\xa0implies that the portion of outstanding AT1 and T2 \ninstruments issued by ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xc2\xa0Bank\xc2\xa0N.V. (the \nresolution entity) in excess of the minimum own \nfunds\xc2\xa0requirement (excluding the SRB) can no longer \nfully\xc2\xa0contribute to the consolidated capital ratios of \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xc2\xa0Group.\n\nOn our Investor Day in November 2018, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO \nannounced it would explore the simplification of its \ncorporate structure by merging ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xc2\xa0Group with \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xc2\xa0Bank. The Bank is making further preparations \nto proceed with this legal merger, which will require \nregulatory approval and the consent of several stakeholders. \nA legal merger will result in simplification of\xc2\xa0our organisation \nand financial benefits (lower costs and\xc2\xa0higher regulatory \ncapital ratios). The simplification of the corporate structure \nremoves the AT1 shortfall and is beneficial to the Tier 1, \ntotal capital and leverage ratio at the Group consolidated \nlevel, as the EBA interpretation for\xc2\xa0minority interest rules \nno longer applies.\n\nAdditional Tier 1\nA total of EUR\xc2\xa02.0\xc2\xa0billion of AT1 instruments is currently \noutstanding. The AT1 instruments have triggers at the \nGroup level (7% CET1), Bank sub-consolidated level \n(5.125% CET1) and Bank solo level (5.125% CET1). If \nthe\xc2\xa0CET1 ratio breaks through the trigger level, the AT1 \nis\xc2\xa0temporarily written down. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO is comfortably \n\nabove the trigger levels, with the Group level CET1 ratio \nat\xc2\xa018.4%, the Bank sub-consolidated CET1 ratio at 18.4% \nand the Bank solo CET1 ratio at 17.2%. Available distributable \nitems (ADI) at 31 December 2018 totalled EUR\xc2\xa018.5\xc2\xa0billion.\n\nTier 2 capital\nThe phase-in total capital ratio (22.2%) increased by \n0.9\xc2\xa0percentage points compared to 31 December 2017 \ndue to profit accumulation and an RWA decrease, partly \noffset by the effect of the minority interest rule.\n\nRisk-weighted assets\nTotal RWA decreased by EUR\xc2\xa00.8\xc2\xa0billion to EUR\xc2\xa0105.4\xc2\xa0billion \nat 31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: EUR\xc2\xa0106.2\xc2\xa0billion). \nThis decrease was primarily driven by market risk and \noperational risk, partly offset by credit risk. More information \non RWA is provided in the Risk section of this report.\n\nFurther information on share capital, dividend \nand\xc2\xa0capital instruments\nShare capital\nThe share capital remained unchanged in 2018. At \n31\xc2\xa0December 2017, the authorised share capital amounted \nto\xc2\xa0EUR\xc2\xa04,700\xc2\xa0million, distributed as 4,500\xc2\xa0million class A \nordinary shares and 200\xc2\xa0million class B ordinary shares. \nClass A and B ordinary shares have a nominal value of \nEUR\xc2\xa01.00 each.\n\nAt 31 December 2018, issued and paid-up capital amounted \nto EUR\xc2\xa0940\xc2\xa0million and consisted of 940\xc2\xa0million class A \nordinary shares. Further information is provided in note 32 \nto the Annual Financial Statements.\n\nDividend\nFrom 2018 onwards, the dividend payout has been set \nat\xc2\xa050% of net sustainable profit attributable to owners \nof\xc2\xa0the parent company, excluding exceptional items that \nsignificantly distort profitability. Additional distributions, \nwhich can either be special dividends or share buy-backs \n(subject to regulatory approval), will be considered if \ncapital is within or above the target range and will be \nsubject to other circumstances, including regulatory and \ncommercial considerations. The combined distribution \nwill\xc2\xa0be at least 50% of sustainable profit.\n\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO proposes a final cash dividend of \nEUR\xc2\xa0752\xc2\xa0million, representing EUR\xc2\xa00.80 per share and \nreflecting an additional distribution of EUR\xc2\xa0260\xc2\xa0million \non\xc2\xa0top of the 50% payout ratio. Together with the interim \ncash dividend of EUR\xc2\xa0611\xc2\xa0million, this will bring the total \ndividend for 2018 to EUR\xc2\xa01,363\xc2\xa0million or EUR\xc2\xa01.45 per \nshare. This brings the payout ratio to 62% of sustainable \nprofit after deduction of AT1 coupon payments and \nminority interests and reflects a 12% additional \ndistribution. In 2017, the payout ratio was 50% with \na\xc2\xa0EUR\xc2\xa01.45 dividend per share, or EUR\xc2\xa01.363\xc2\xa0million, \n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadershipGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceLeadership & governanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherRisk, funding & capital\x0cRisk, funding & capital  /  Risk, funding & capital\xc2\xa0review  /  Capital\n\n110\n\nof\xc2\xa0which EUR\xc2\xa0611\xc2\xa0million (EUR\xc2\xa00.65 per share) was \ninterim dividend and EUR\xc2\xa0752\xc2\xa0million (EUR\xc2\xa00.80 per share) \nwas final dividend.\n\nWe expect continuing capital generation and are well \nplaced to consider additional distributions in excess of \nthe\xc2\xa0targeted 50% payout.

The EU legislative bodies are \ncurrently discussing finalisation of these proposals. \n\nThe Basel Committee has set the implementation date at \n1 January 2022, from which date the output floor will be \ngradually phased-in over a period of 5 years. Basel IV will \n\nsignificantly impact ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s portfolio. Based on year-\nend 2018 figures, the assessment indicates a potential \nincrease of RWA of around 36% when applying a 72.5% \nfloor. The calculations could still contain uncertainties, \nas\xc2\xa0a\xc2\xa0number of assumptions are made on how Basel IV \nstandards will be applied. The potential impact may differ, \ndepending on the implementation into European law and \nregulations.

ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO aims for a leverage ratio of at \nleast 4%.

The Basel Committee \non Banking Supervision and the Council of Finance \nMinisters of the European Union (ECOFIN) both reached \nagreement on the use of the SA-CCR calculation \n\nmethodology for clearing guarantees, providing further \nconfidence that this will be applicable via CRR2 in 2021 \nat\xc2\xa0the earliest.

The Supervisory Board \nunderstands that ABN AMRO already carried out a review \nof our Corporate & Institutional Banking business and that a \nreview of its Private Banking clients is now nearly complete. \nABN AMRO has developed remediation programmes to \nspeed up remediation actions in relation to International \nCard Services (ICS) and Commercial Banking and has shared \nthese with the Dutch Central Bank and committed to their \nexecution. For the incremental external costs involved, the \nSupervisory Board agreed with a provision taken in 2018 \nof EUR 85 million \xe2\x80\x93 for ICS and Commercial Banking. The \namount is based on, among other items, the total number \nof files, the time needed to review each file and the \npercentage that will be reviewed using external resources.\n\nOver the past year, a number of European banks have \nbeen the object of money laundering investigations. The \nSupervisory Board recognises that, with financial crime, \nABN AMRO has to be vigilant and needs to be constantly \nlooking for ways to strengthen its systems and raise  \nawareness of potential risks within the bank. Therefore, \nthe Supervisory Board encourages ABN AMRO to continue \ninvesting in combatting financial crime of any form.\n\nMembers of the Supervisory Board actively engaged its key \nstakeholders in 2018, visiting various parts of the \norganisation in the Netherlands and internationally to \nobtain client and staff feedback regarding the bank\xe2\x80\x99s duty \nof care, integrity, client focus, culture and competitive \ndifferentiation. The two members appointed pursuant to \nthe enhanced recommendation right of the Employee \nCouncil, Mr ten Have and Ms Roobeek, met regularly with \nthe Employee Council throughout the year to maintain an \nactive dialogue and to obtain the Employee Council\xe2\x80\x99s \nthoughts and input on various matters, including the top \nmanagement structure, appointments, diversity, work \nsatisfaction and the negotiations for a new Collective Labour \nAgreement, which was concluded at the beginning of 2018. \nThe Chairman and other members of the Supervisory Board \nalso met with the Employee Council on several formal and \ninformal occasions during the year. This included the annual \n\nhalf-day joint meeting of the Supervisory Board, the \nExecutive Committee and the Employee Council (\xe2\x80\x98drie \nraden overleg\xe2\x80\x99), held on 27\xc2\xa0September 2018. This year, the \njoint session focused on the revised strategy, and more \nspecifically on the third pillar of building a future-proof bank \nby further developing a solid and stable organisation that is \nopen and transparent and able to respond optimally to the \nmarket. The Supervisory Board appreciates the constructive \nrelationship it has with the Employee Council, and highly \nvalues the input, engagement, suggestions and considerations \nprovided by the Employee Council in the interests of the \nbank. Active engagement was also maintained throughout \nthe year with the Dutch Central Bank (DNB), the European \nCentral Bank (ECB), AFM, STAK\xc2\xa0AAG and NLFI. The \nSupervisory Board\xe2\x80\x99s aim throughout was to ensure that the \nbank is well positioned to create long-term value for its \nshareholders and for society, while focusing firmly on clients\xe2\x80\x99 \ninterests and balancing the interests of all stakeholders.\n\nThe Supervisory Board approved amendments to the \nExecutive Board Rules of Procedure (including the \nExecutive Committee Rules of Procedure) and the \nSupervisory Board Rules of Procedure on 30 June 2018. \nThese amendments represented the formal incorporation \nof the EBA Guidelines on Suitability and Internal \nGovernance into the Rules of Procedure.\n\nA description of the duties, responsibilities and current \ncomposition of the Supervisory Board, including its \ncommittees and other positions held by members of the \nSupervisory Board, is provided in the Supervisory Board \nsection of this chapter. More information on remuneration \nis provided under Remuneration in this chapter. These \nsubjects are considered to be incorporated, by reference, \nin this Report of the Supervisory Board.\n\nSupervisory Board Committees\nAudit Committee\nThe Audit Committee is tasked with the direct supervision \nof all matters relating to financial reporting and controlling. \nIn doing so, it is responsible for supervising and advising \nthe complete Supervisory Board on topics such as \n(i)\xc2\xa0the\xc2\xa0assessment of the principles of valuation and \ndetermination of results for the financial statements, \n(ii)\xc2\xa0internal control and financial reporting functions, (iii) \ninternal and external audit, (iv) risk assessment of issues \nthat could impact the financial reporting, (v) regulatory \ncompliance in relation to financial reporting, (vi) mediation \nbetween internal or external auditors and/or management \nif required, and (vii) reporting to the Supervisory Board.\n\nThroughout 2018, the Audit Committee (the \xe2\x80\x98Committee\xe2\x80\x99) \nconsisted of Mr Tjalling Tiemstra (Chairman), Mr Arjen \nDorland and Mr Jurgen Stegmann.

In addition, \nCommittee members met various department managers \nto ensure the members remained well informed about the \nsubjects under their supervision. Directly after the \nmeeting in March 2018, when the annual accounts were \ndiscussed, the Committee met the external auditor \nbilaterally to seek confirmation that all relevant matters \nfrom the audit had come to the Committee\xe2\x80\x99s attention.\n\nThe topics discussed by the Committee in the plenary \nmeetings included the quarterly reports, the interim and \nannual accounts, the quarterly press releases, the interim \nand final dividend proposals, the 2017 Integrated Annual \nReview and 2017 Annual Report of ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO, and key \n\naudit matters reported by internal and external audit, such \nas those described in the Independent Auditor\xe2\x80\x99s Report \non\xc2\xa0page 258 and further of this Annual Report.

Financial \nKPIs have since been added to align with the bank\xe2\x80\x99s new \nstrategic direction. The Committee also recommended \nsharpening the KPI sustainability for the coming years. \nIn\xc2\xa0addition, a new performance management system was \nintroduced for staff covered by the Collective Labour \nAgreement. This is part of the agile way of working and \nentails a continual dialogue on targets.\n\nIn addition, the Committee recommended that more \nmanagement attention should be paid to crucial matters \nsuch as talent and leadership development, talent retention, \nsuccession planning, diversity in the broadest sense, the \ndesign and establishment of a leadership development \nfunction and programme, purpose and culture change.\n\nOther subjects that were discussed extensively \nthroughout the year included the process for selecting \nand\xc2\xa0nominating the new Chairman and two prospective \nSupervisory Board members (all these searches were \nconducted by an independent, external search firm, \nbased\xc2\xa0on clearly defined role descriptions, and included \ninterviews with multiple candidates for each role), \nsuccession planning, the European Banking Authority \nsuitability guidelines and the results of the 2018 \nEmployee\xc2\xa0Engagement Survey.\n\nPerformance evaluation\nWhen the Executive Committee was set up in March \n2017, it was decided that the new management structure \nshould be evaluated after a year. The Supervisory Board and \nthe Executive Board commissioned two external experts \nto carry out this evaluation. This evaluation, carried out in \n2018, addressed themes such as the Executive Board and \n\nExecutive Committee structures, the Supervisory Board\xe2\x80\x99s \nrole and involvement, the bank\xe2\x80\x99s leadership, purpose and \nstrategic story, as well as the implementation of the \nculture change. At the same time, the ECB was working \nwith DNB to evaluate the same issues, particularly internal \ngovernance and risk management, as part of its on-site \ninspections 2018. From\xc2\xa0both evaluations board room \ndynamics (the way of working together, leadership style \nand open relationships) as well as technical aspects (the \nimportance of clearly allocated tasks and responsibilities) \ncame up as focus areas. These focus areas have been \nextensively discussed and are currently being addressed. \nThe assessments of the Supervisory Board, Executive \nBoard and Executive Committee for the 2018 performance \nyear will be carried out in 2019.\n\nIntroductory Programme and Lifelong Learning \nProgramme\nIntroductory Programme\nFollowing their appointment, all new members of the \nSupervisory Board complete an extensive introductory \nprogramme designed to ensure they have the relevant \nknowledge needed to fulfil their role, including thorough \nknowledge of ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group and its business \nactivities, financial reporting by the Group and general \nfinancial, social and legal affairs. As the knowledge, \nbackground and experience of newly appointed members \nof the Supervisory Board differ, the curriculum of the \nintroductory programme is tailor-made.       \n\nLifelong Learning Programme\nA lifelong learning programme is in place for members \nof\xc2\xa0the Executive Board and Executive Committee. \nThis\xc2\xa0is\xc2\xa0designed to keep their expertise up to date and to \nbroaden and deepen their knowledge, where necessary. \nThe objective is for members of the Executive Board and \nExecutive Committee to participate in the same training \nsessions so as to foster knowledge-sharing. The\xc2\xa0curriculum \nis developed and updated continually to\xc2\xa0ensure a balanced \nprogramme covering all relevant aspects of the\xc2\xa0bank\xe2\x80\x99s \nperformance and taking into account current developments \nin the global financial industry. Topics covered in 2018, in \njoint sessions with management, included risk governance, \nculture and conduct, interest rate risk management, data \nand modelling, sustainability, agile ways of doing business \nand\xc2\xa0innovation.

At 31 December 2018, all shares \nin\xc2\xa0the capital of ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group were held by two \nfoundations: NLFI and STAK\xc2\xa0AAG. On that date, NLFI held \n56.3% in ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group, of which 49.9% is directly \nheld via ordinary shares and 6.4% is indirectly held via \ndepositary receipts for shares in ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group. \nOn\xc2\xa0that date, STAK\xc2\xa0AAG held 50.1% of the shares in the \nissued capital of ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group. Only STAK\xc2\xa0AAG\xe2\x80\x99s \ndepositary receipts have been issued with the \ncooperation\xc2\xa0of ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group and are traded \non\xc2\xa0Euronext Amsterdam.\n\nNLFI\nThe Dutch State holds an interest in ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group \nthrough NLFI. NLFI was set up with the objective to \navoid potential conflicting responsibilities that the Dutch \nMinister of Finance might otherwise face and to avoid \nundesired political influence being exerted. NLFI issued \nexchangeable depositary receipts for shares in the \ncapital of ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group to the Dutch State. NLFI is \nresponsible for managing these shares and exercising \nall rights associated with these shares under Dutch \nlaw, including voting rights. NLFI acts as a standalone \nshareholder independently from the Dutch State, including \nthe Dutch Ministry of Finance. However, important \ndecisions taken by NLFI require the prior approval of the \nDutch Minister of Finance, who can also give binding \nvoting instructions to NLFI with respect to such decisions. \nNLFI is not permitted to dispose of or encumber the \nordinary shares in the capital of ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group, \nexcept pursuant to an authorisation from and on behalf of \nthe Dutch Minister of Finance. \n \nNLFI entered into a Relationship Agreement with \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group governing their relationship after \nthe IPO. The full text of the Relationship Agreement is \navailable on abnamro.com. The Relationship Agreement \nwill terminate if and when NLFI (directly or indirectly) \nholds less than 10% of ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group\xe2\x80\x99s issued share \ncapital. A limited number of clauses will not terminate \nunder any circumstances. The Relationship Agreement \nincludes, among other things, the following provisions, \nsubject to certain conditions stated in the agreement:\n \xc3\x85 the right of NLFI to be consulted by (a) the Supervisory \n\nBoard on the appointment or reappointment of (i) \nmembers of the Managing Board and (ii) the Chairman \nof the Managing Board or the Supervisory Board, \nand (b) the Managing Board on a proposal for the \nappointment of the external auditor.

STAK\xc2\xa0AAG has acquired such shares for the \npurpose of administration (ten titel van beheer) in \nexchange for depositary receipts. The manner in which \nthis structure can serve as a defence measure and \nSTAK\xc2\xa0AAG\xe2\x80\x99s role in this is further described in this \nsection\xc2\xa0under Anti-takeover measures. \n\xc2\xa0 \nIn addition to serving as a defence measure, STAK\xc2\xa0AAG \nalso aims to promote the exchange of information \nbetween ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group on the one hand and holders \nof depositary receipts and shareholders on the other. \nIt\xc2\xa0also promotes the acquisition of voting instructions \nfrom\xc2\xa0DR holders, for example by organising a meeting \nof\xc2\xa0depositary receipt holders prior to ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group\xe2\x80\x99s \nGeneral Meeting. STAK\xc2\xa0AAG will also report on its \nactivities at least once a year in its annual report. \nIn\xc2\xa0addition, further sell-downs of NLFI\xe2\x80\x99s shareholding \nin\xc2\xa0ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group will take place through STAK\xc2\xa0AAG \n(and in the form of depositary receipts) only. \n\xc2\xa0 \nThe Trust Conditions of STAK\xc2\xa0AAG state that it will ensure \nthat, no later than two weeks before a General Meeting of \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group is held, a meeting of depositary receipt \nholders is held at which the agenda items of that General \nMeeting will be discussed. Accordingly, STAK\xc2\xa0AAG held \nmeetings of depositary receipt holders on 6 February \n2018, 3 May 2018 and 25 June 2018. \n\xc2\xa0 \nThe STAK\xc2\xa0AAG website (stakaag.org) provides more \ninformation on the activities of STAK\xc2\xa0AAG, as well as its \nannual report, articles of association (including STAK\xc2\xa0AAG\xe2\x80\x99s \nobjectives), the Trust Conditions and any information  \nrelating to meetings of depositary receipt holders. \n\xc2\xa0 \nTwo periodic meetings were held between ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO \nand STAK\xc2\xa0AAG in 2018.

The purpose of having a structure \nunder which depositary receipts are created and \nSTAK\xc2\xa0AAG is the legal owner of the underlying shares \nis\xc2\xa0to\xc2\xa0create a defence measure. \n\xc2\xa0 \nSTAK\xc2\xa0AAG will do everything in its power to deter any \naction that could affect the independence, continuity or \nidentity of ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO. In a non-hostile situation, \nSTAK\xc2\xa0AAG will act primarily in the interests of depositary \nreceipt holders. In a hostile situation, STAK\xc2\xa0AAG will act \nprimarily in the interests of ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group and its \nbusiness enterprises. Under all circumstances STAK\xc2\xa0AAG \nwill also take into account the legitimate interests of all \nother stakeholders: clients, savers and deposit holders, \nshareholders, depositary receipt holders, employees, and \nthe society in which ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO operates. \n\xc2\xa0 \nIn a non-hostile situation, STAK\xc2\xa0AAG will grant a power of \nattorney to the holders of depositary receipts to exercise \nthe voting rights attached to the underlying shares. \nSTAK\xc2\xa0AAG will not exercise voting rights on the shares, \nunless holders of depositary receipts have requested it to \ndo so. This may be different under hostile circumstances \nas described in section 2:118a of the Dutch Civil Code. \nIn\xc2\xa0this case, STAK\xc2\xa0AAG may refuse or revoke powers \nof\xc2\xa0attorney for up to two years (whereby NLFI must pre-\napprove this decision by STAK\xc2\xa0AAG as long as NLFI holds \nat least 33 1/3% of the shares in ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group). In \nthis case, STAK\xc2\xa0AAG will vote itself. In doing so, it should, \npursuant to the Trust Conditions and the articles of \nassociation of STAK\xc2\xa0AAG, focus primarily on ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s \ninterests, taking into account the legitimate interests of \nthe stakeholders mentioned above.       \n\nEmployee Council\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s employees are represented by works \ncouncils (ondernemingsraden) at all levels of its group \nin\xc2\xa0which specifically appointed delegates are centralised in \nthe overarching Employee Council (Raad van Medewerkers). \n\nUnder Dutch law, the managing board of any company \nrunning an enterprise where a works council has been \nestablished must seek the non-binding advice of the \nworks council before taking certain decisions with respect \nto the enterprise, such as those related to a major \nrestructuring, a change of control, or the appointment or \ndismissal of a member of the managing board. Certain \nother decisions directly involving employment matters that \napply either to all employees or certain groups of \nemployees may only be taken with the works council\xe2\x80\x99s \nconsent. \n\xc2\xa0 \nThe Employee Council deals primarily with topics that \naffect all parts of the group\xe2\x80\x99s organisation and meets \nregularly with members of the Executive Board and \nSupervisory Board on various other occasions throughout \nthe year,\xc2\xa0including an annual joint meeting of the \nExecutive Committee, the Supervisory Board and the \nEmployee Council. The Employee Council and \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xc2\xa0Group have entered into an agreement under \nwhich the Employee Council has been granted certain \nadditional rights (the Works Council Covenant). Under the \nWorks Council Covenant, the Employee Council has the \nright of inquiry (enqu\xc3\xaaterecht) within the meaning of \nSection 2:346 of the Dutch Civil Code in the event of a \nhostile situation. The Works Council Covenant defines the \nfollowing situations as hostile: (i) a public offer has been \nannounced or is made in respect of shares in the capital of \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group (or in respect of depositary receipts \nrepresenting such shares) or there is a justified \nexpectation that this will take place, without agreement \nfirst having been reached between the bidder and \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group, (ii) the exercise of the voting rights \nby\xc2\xa0a depositary receipt holder or shareholder would \neffectively be in conflict with the interests of \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xc2\xa0Group and its business, or (iii) any other \nsituation in which the independence, continuity or identity \nof ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group and the enterprises associated with \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group could be harmed. Other situations can \nbe qualified as hostile by means of an agreement \nbetween the Employee Council and ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group. \nFurthermore, if\xc2\xa0NLFI requests the consent, cooperation \nand/or a position statement of ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group in the \nevent of a\xc2\xa0subsequent placement or a private sale of \nshares or depositary receipts, the Employee Council will \nbe requested by ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group to provide advice \nwithin the meaning of articles 25 and 26 of the Works \nCouncils Act (Wet op de Ondernemingsraden).      \n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership structureGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalAnnual Financial StatementsOtherLeadership & governance\x0cLeadership & governance  /  Codes and regulations\n\n141\n\nCodes and regulations\n\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group is required to comply with a wide \nvariety of governance codes and regulations. This includes \nthe Dutch Corporate Governance Code, the Banking \nCode\xc2\xa0and CRD IV. This section explains how \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xc2\xa0Group complies with these codes and \nregulations. More\xc2\xa0comprehensive overviews of \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group\xe2\x80\x99s compliance with such codes and \nregulations are published\xc2\xa0under the Corporate Governance \nsection on abnamro.com.       \n\nDutch Corporate Governance\nWe believe that corporate governance that meets high \ninternational standards significantly boosts the confidence \nof the stakeholders in a company. Compliance with the \napplicable corporate governance codes by financial \ninstitutions is an important basis for restoring trust in \nthe\xc2\xa0financial sector as a whole. Since depositary receipts \nfor shares in ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group are listed on Euronext \nAmsterdam, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group is required to adhere \nto\xc2\xa0the Dutch Corporate Governance Code.\n\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group has complied with all principles and \nbest practices of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, \nexcept for the deviations and nuances described below. \nUnder the Corporate Governance section on its website, \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group also publishes a detailed \xe2\x80\x98comply or \nexplain\xe2\x80\x99 list with regard to the Corporate Governance Code \napplicable in 2018.\n\nBest practice provision 1.3.6 is not applicable as \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO does have an internal audit function.\n\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group applies principle 2.7 and best practice \nprovisions 2.7.1 through 2.7.4, which deal with actual and \napparent conflicts of interest. However, \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xc2\xa0Group makes an exception with respect to \nqualitative conflicts of interest (kwalitatief tegenstrijdige \nbelangen) that are exclusively the result of the identical \ncomposition of the Executive Boards of ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Bank \nand ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group, and the Supervisory Boards of \nthe\xc2\xa0respective entities.\n\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO applies best practice provision 2.1.9, which \nstates that the chairman of the supervisory board should \nnot be a former member of the management board of the \ncompany. Although Mr Tom de Swaan was a member of \nthe Managing Board of the former ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO, the \ncurrent ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO is the result of various legal and \noperational separations and combinations, a merger and \na\xc2\xa0legal demerger that took place after the acquisition of \nthe former ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Holding N.V. (the \xe2\x80\x98former \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO group\xe2\x80\x99) by a consortium of banks in October \n2007. The consortium consisted of the Royal Bank of \nScotland Group, Fortis and Banco Santander S.A (the \n\xe2\x80\x98Consortium\xe2\x80\x99). In October 2008, when the Fortis group \n\nexperienced financial difficulties, the Dutch State acquired \ncertain operations of the Fortis group, as well as Fortis\xe2\x80\x99 \ninterest in the vehicle that had acquired the former \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO group. The current ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group N.V. \nwas newly incorporated on 18 December 2009 to hold the \noperations, assets and liabilities of parts of the former \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO group and the part of the Fortis group \nacquired by the Dutch State. On 6 February 2010, the new \nand current ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Bank demerged from the former \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Bank N.V. into a newly incorporated entity. \nThe former ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Bank N.V. was subsequently \nrenamed Royal Bank of Scotland N.V. On 1 July 2010, the \nnew ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Bank and Fortis Bank (Nederland) N.V. \nmerged pursuant to a legal merger (juridische fusie), \nfollowing which the current ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Bank was \nthe\xc2\xa0surviving entity (verkrijgende vennootschap) and \nFortis\xc2\xa0Bank (Nederland) N.V. was the disappearing \nentity\xc2\xa0(verdwijnende vennootschap). The current \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group and ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Bank are therefore \ndifferent entities from the former ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Holding N.V. \nor former ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Bank N.V .\n\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group applies best practice provisions 2.2.5, \n2.3.2 and 2.3.3, which set out the roles and \nresponsibilities of the remuneration committee and the \nselection and appointment committee. Instead, however, \nof having a separate remuneration committee and a \nselection and nomination committee, these committees \nare combined into one committee.\n\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group applies best practice provision 4.1.3, \nwhich states, among other things, that (a) each substantial \nchange in the corporate governance structure of \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group and in the compliance with the Code \nand (b) material changes in the Articles of Association \nshould be presented to the General Meeting as a separate \ndiscussion item or voting item, as applicable. The only \nexception to this practice is that the Executive Board and \nthe Supervisory Board may decide to place certain topics \non the agenda under one agenda item if these topics are \njustifiably related. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group considers this to be \na further substantiation of this best practice provision, \nwhich may be necessary due to the fact that a situation \ncould arise in which proposals to amend the Articles of \nAssociation or the corporate governance structure of \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group are interrelated in such a way that \nseparate votes on each of those proposals could result in \nan imbalanced voting result and consequently in an \nimbalance in the corporate governance structure.\n\nBest practice provision 4.3.3 is not applicable as \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group does have a statutory two-tier status \n(structuurregime).\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadershipGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalAnnual Financial StatementsOtherLeadership & governance\x0cLeadership & governance  /  Codes and regulations\n\n142\n\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group does not apply principle 4.4. \nIn\xc2\xa0contradiction to this principle and provision, the issuing \nof depositary receipts by STAK\xc2\xa0AAG is primarily used as \na\xc2\xa0defence measure and not to prevent a situation in which, \nas a result of shareholder absenteeism, a minority of \nshareholders can control the decision-making process at \na\xc2\xa0General Meeting. Regulatory considerations have been \ndecisive in choosing a structure with depositary receipts \nas a protective measure. Declarations of No Objection \ncould be obtained up front only by means of a structure \nwith depositary receipts. These Declarations of \nNo\xc2\xa0Objection are required in connection with the direct \nor\xc2\xa0indirect acquisition of a qualified holding in \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xc2\xa0Bank and certain other regulated entities \nin\xc2\xa0which ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group holds an interest. Therefore, \nthis\xc2\xa0structure provides the greatest possible certainty \nof\xc2\xa0adequate protection for ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group against \na\xc2\xa0hostile takeover. Although the issuing of depositary \nreceipts has been set up primarily as a defence measure \nand not to prevent absenteeism, STAK\xc2\xa0AAG aims to \npromote the exchange of information between \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group on the one hand and holders of \ndepositary receipts and shareholders on the other by, \nfor\xc2\xa0example, organising a meeting of depositary receipt \nholders before every General Meeting. More information \non the purpose and functioning of the depositary receipts \nand STAK\xc2\xa0AAG, including information on situations in \nwhich STAK\xc2\xa0AAG may decide to limit, refuse or revoke \npowers of attorney (and to not observe any voting \ninstructions received), can be found on the STAK\xc2\xa0AAG \nwebsite (stakaag.org).\n\nCompliance with best practice provisions 4.4.1 through \n4.4.5 and 4.4.7 through 4.4.8 are a responsibility of \nthe\xc2\xa0board of STAK\xc2\xa0AAG. With respect to best practice \nprovisions 4.4.5 and 4.4.8, the following applies. In a \nnon-hostile situation, STAK\xc2\xa0AAG will act primarily in the \ninterests of depositary receipt holders. In a hostile \nsituation, STAK\xc2\xa0AAG will act primarily in the interests of \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group and its business enterprises. Under \nall\xc2\xa0circumstances STAK\xc2\xa0AAG will also take into account \nthe legitimate interests of all other stakeholders: clients, \nsavers and deposit holders, shareholders, depositary \nreceipt holders, employees, and the society in which \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO operates. Furthermore, STAK\xc2\xa0AAG has in \nprinciple the obligation to grant a power of attorney to \ndepositary receipt holders to exercise the voting rights \nattached to the underlying shares and will not exercise \nvoting rights on the shares in ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group (unless \ndepositary receipt holders have requested STAK\xc2\xa0AAG \nto\xc2\xa0do so). The foregoing could be different in hostile \nsituations as described in Article 2:118a of the Dutch Civil \nCode. STAK\xc2\xa0AAG may then decide to (a) limit, exclude or \nrevoke powers of attorney and (b) not observe voting \ninstructions received for a period of up to two years. \nFurthermore, under the depositary receipt terms, when \nexercising the voting rights in a hostile situation, \n\nSTAK\xc2\xa0AAG should focus primarily on the interests \nof\xc2\xa0ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group and its business enterprises \nas\xc2\xa0set\xc2\xa0out above.   \n\nPrinciple 5.1 and best practice provisions 5.1.1 through \n5.1.5 are not applicable because ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group has \na\xc2\xa0two-tier board.\n\nDutch Banking Code\nThe Dutch Banking Code sets out principles that banks \nwith a corporate seat in the Netherlands should observe \nin\xc2\xa0terms of corporate governance, risk management, audit \nand remuneration. The Dutch Banking Code applies to \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Bank as the main entity within a group that \nholds a banking licence.\n\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO is therefore committed to complying with \nthe\xc2\xa0Dutch Banking Code and devotes a great deal of \neffort\xc2\xa0to ensuring that the spirit of the code is reflected \nin\xc2\xa0the behaviour of its employees and the culture \nof\xc2\xa0the\xc2\xa0bank. As\xc2\xa0such, we are pleased to confirm that \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xc2\xa0Group complies with the principles of the \nDutch Banking Code. A principle-by-principle overview of \nthe manner in which ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Bank complied during \n2018 with the Dutch Banking Code is published on \nabnamro.com. Throughout 2018, we continued to improve \nthe manner in which we apply the principles of the Dutch \nBanking Code, taking into account the focus areas \nindicated by the Dutch Banking Code Monitoring \nCommittee.

ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO applies the principles of \nthe Dutch Banking Code to all of these Dutch subsidiaries \non a\xc2\xa0consolidated basis by developing group-wide policies \nand standards to promote compliance with internal and \nexternal rules and best-practice provisions. In view, \nhowever, of the differences between the activities, \norganisation and risk management of the subsidiaries, \nthe\xc2\xa0application of group-wide policy and standards can \nvary from one subsidiary to another.

These \nArticles set out governance, disclosure, remuneration and \nnomination requirements for financial institutions. The \nobligation to publish such an overview was implemented \ninto Dutch law by Article 134b of the Decree on Prudential \nMeasures FMSA (Besluit prudenti\xc3\xable regels Wft). \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO has published an overview on abnamro.com \nof how ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group and ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Bank comply \nwith Article 134b of the Decree on Prudential Measures \nand Article 96 of CRD IV.\n\nUnder CRD IV, all members of the management body of a \nbank (including non-executive members or supervisory \nboard members acting in their role of overseeing and \nmonitoring management decision-making) must commit \nsufficient time to allow them to perform their duties and \nto be able to understand the bank\xe2\x80\x99s business. In respect \nof significant banks, such as ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Bank, Article 91 \nof CRD IV contains a specific regulation on limiting the \nnumber of executive and non-executive directorships such \nmembers may hold (these rules have been implemented \nin Dutch law in Section 3:8(3) Dutch Financial Markets \nSupervision Act).

The remuneration policy and \npractices for the Supervisory Board, the Executive Board \nand other Identified Staff are discussed in greater detail \nin\xc2\xa0the subsequent sections of this report.\xc2\xa0\n\nOverview\nAs a financial institution ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO is subject to many \nguidelines and restrictions with respect to remuneration. \nSince 2015, limitations with respect to remuneration and, \nmore specifically, to variable remuneration have applied \nto\xc2\xa0all employees in the Dutch financial sector, with even \nmore restrictions applying to financial institutions to which \nthe Dutch State provides support in the form of \nshareholdings. This applies to ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO, with the \nrestrictions including a prohibition on bonuses for a \nspecific group of senior employees. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO aims \nto\xc2\xa0combine all applicable remuneration restrictions \nwith\xc2\xa0our corporate strategy.\xc2\xa0\n\nRemuneration philosophy\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s long-term corporate strategy and its strategic \npriorities are embedded in our remuneration policy and \nprinciples. In 2018 this applied to the four strategic \npriorities reflected in our remuneration philosophy: \n \xc3\x85 Client-driven \xe2\x80\x93 Our clients\xe2\x80\x99 interests come first in \n\neverything we do;\n\n \xc3\x85 Invest in the future \xe2\x80\x93 We need a flexible and agile \n\nworkforce and want to be an attractive employer for \nwhich talented people are eager to work for;\n\n \xc3\x85 Moderate risk profile \xe2\x80\x93 We adhere to all applicable \n\nrules and regulations on remuneration and take care to \nensure that our performance criteria do not provide any \nincentives for excessive risk-taking;\n\n \xc3\x85 Sustainable growth \xe2\x80\x93 We treat our employees as our \n\nmost valuable asset.\xc2\xa0       \n\nAs ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO always aims to combine the pillars of our \ncorporate strategy with our remuneration philosophy, the \nremuneration principles will be revisited and aligned with \nthe new strategy pillars from 2019 onwards. An overview \nof the new strategy can be found in the Strategy chapter. \nThe remuneration policy applying in 2018 is described \nbelow.\n\nRemuneration policy\nResponsible remuneration policy\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO aims to pursue a responsible remuneration \npolicy that remains within the regulatory boundaries, such \nas limitations on variable remuneration and the prohibition \non bonuses for a specific group of senior employees, \nwhile taking into account the interests of all our \nstakeholders and best practices.\xc2\xa0\n\nOur remuneration principles are embedded in \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s Global Reward Policy, which is designed \nto\xc2\xa0support ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s business strategy, objectives, \nvalues and long-term interests. Our remuneration policy \nshould enable us to attract and retain the right talent and \nshould ensure that we can meet our responsibilities \ntowards clients and other stakeholders, both now and in \nthe future. Furthermore it provides a framework for \neffectively managing reward and performance across the \nbank. It is therefore periodically updated in order to remain \naligned with ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s goals and the applicable \nguidelines and regulations. The Supervisory Board \napproves the general remuneration principles laid down \nin\xc2\xa0the Global Reward Policy and assesses the general \nprinciples and exceptions that relate to the applicable \ngovernance and/or internationally applicable guidelines \nand\xc2\xa0regulations within the financial sector. The policy is \ntherefore regularly reviewed, taking account of the \ncompany\xe2\x80\x99s strategy and culture, and any changes in these, \nand factors such as risk awareness, targets and corporate \nvalues, as well as relevant market practice. It also takes \ninto account external requirements with respect to \ngovernance, the international context and relevant \nmarket\xc2\xa0data.\xc2\xa0\n\nThe Global Reward Policy applies at all levels and in all \ncountries of ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s international network (including \nbranch offices). Different starting points apply to the \nvarious levels of the bank\xe2\x80\x99s workforce, but we always \nposition our remuneration levels around the median of the \nrelevant labour market while keeping labour costs under \ncontrol. A typical remuneration package for ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO \nemployees consists of an annual base salary, annual \nvariable remuneration if the relevant market practice so \nrequires, benefits and other entitlements. We also \nconsider specific rules with respect to those staff whose \nprofessional activities could have a material impact on the \nbank\xe2\x80\x99s risk profile. Within ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO, individuals within \nthis group are referred to as Identified Staff.\n\nA separate Reward Policy applies to members of \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s Executive Board. This policy is in alignment \nwith the policy that was adopted in 2010 for the then \nManaging Board. The Executive Board\xe2\x80\x99s policy is aligned \nwith all relevant and applicable guidelines and regulations \nand reflects applicable developments and \nrecommendations of the EBA, ECB, DNB, AFM Banking \nCode and Corporate Governance Code.\xc2\xa0\n\nOur annual performance management cycle for Identified \nStaff aims to create links between performance (realistic, \nsustainable results) and reward in such a way that reward \nis aligned with both the employee\xe2\x80\x99s and the bank\xe2\x80\x99s \nperformance. We use a set of balanced financial and non-\nfinancial targets, as well as qualitative and quantitative \n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadershipGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalAnnual Financial StatementsOtherLeadership & governance\x0cKPIs. For 2018, our Group non-financial KPIs consisted of \nSociety at Large (based on the Dow Jones Index ranking \nand the AFM/NVB Confidence Monitor Banks), Employee \nEngagement (via the annual survey), the Net Promoter \nScore and House in Order (conveying the desired \ncompliance and risk culture).The financial targets used in \n2018 at Group level were revenue growth, RARORAC, \nCET1 ratio and cost ceiling. Cost ceiling and RARORAC \nare also used at a business line level. There is ample room \nto set individual and business-related KPIs, such as \nindividual leadership, collaboration between business lines \nand diversity targets. The table of KPIs for Identified Staff \nprovides more insight into the methodology used.\n\n       In line with the general trend toward less hierarchy and \nmore teamwork ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO wants to subject employees \nto fewer checks and give them more empowerment and \nto offer them the tools needed to keep them well \nequipped to do their job and to deal with the ever-changing \nenvironment. Our responsible remuneration policy should \nenable our employees to further develop their expertise \nand help us create a simpler, more agile organisation. \nWe\xc2\xa0strive to give our staff more autonomy and \nresponsibility, thus making their work more meaningful, \nwhile at the same time ensuring it is aligned with all the \nbank\xe2\x80\x99s current and future priorities. We use Together & \nBetter performance management to further emphasise \nour employees\xe2\x80\x99 ambitions, expertise and development and \nseek alignment with our goals, such as creating long-term \nvalue for all our stakeholders.\n\nChanges in 2018\nThe evaluation of the Act on the Remuneration Policy for \nFinancial Undertakings (Wbfo) was completed in 2018 and \nfollowed by a public consultation on the effectiveness of \nthe remuneration restrictions embedded in the legislation. \nThe Minister of Finance has indicated a wish to impose \nstricter measures regarding the use of the average 20% \nvariable remuneration cap, to introduce a legal obligation \nto account for the relationship between remuneration and \nthe sector and its position in society, to introduce \nmandatory requirements for board members holding \nshares and to impose stricter guidelines for clawing back \nfixed remuneration from board members of system banks.\n\nExpected changes in 2019\nDuring 2019 we will start negotiating a new Collective \nLabour Agreement and will incorporate any necessary \nadjustments and amendments that may follow from the \nWbfo consultation process, as well as any amendments \nrequired owing to changes in the Banking Code.\xc2\xa0\n\n146\n\nRemuneration principles for the Supervisory Board, \nExecutive Board and other Identified Staff\nSupervisory Board remuneration\nThe remuneration of the members of the Supervisory \nBoard is set by the General Meeting of Shareholders, \nbased on a proposal of the Supervisory Board. \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO does not grant any variable remuneration \nor equity to Supervisory Board members in lieu of \nremuneration. The level of remuneration has not changed \nsince 2010. The annual fees applicable since 2010 are \nas\xc2\xa0follows:\n \xc3\x85 Membership of Supervisory Board:\xc2\xa0EUR\xc2\xa050,000 \n\n(EUR\xc2\xa065,000 for the Chairman)\n\n \xc3\x85 Membership of Audit and Risk & Capital \n\nCommittee:\xc2\xa0EUR\xc2\xa012,500 (EUR\xc2\xa015,000 for the Chairman)\n \xc3\x85 Membership\xc2\xa0of Remuneration, Selection & Nomination \n\nCommittee: EUR\xc2\xa010,000 (EUR\xc2\xa012,500 for the \nChairman).\xc2\xa0       \n\nThe remuneration for Supervisory Board committee \nmembership is limited to two such memberships. Details \nof the remuneration of members of the Supervisory Board \nin 2018 are provided in note 35 in the Consolidated \nAnnual\xc2\xa0Financial Statements.\n\nExecutive Board remuneration\nThe Supervisory Board is responsible for proposing the \nremuneration policy and principles for the Executive Board \nand also executes the policy for the Executive Board. \nThe\xc2\xa0policy and principles are subject to shareholder \napproval. The fixed remuneration for the Chairman and \nthree members of ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s Executive Board has \nbeen set at a level slightly below that of the former CEO \nand Managing Board members. The Executive Board \nmembers\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0views have not been taken into account in the \ndesign of the remuneration policy, given the remuneration \nrestrictions that apply as long as the Dutch State provides \nsupport through a shareholding.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\nIn the case of the former Managing Board, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO \nalways aimed for a level of compensation slightly below \nthe median of the relevant markets. while using a peer \ngroup of companies. This peer group consisted of both \nfinancial and non-financial companies in the Netherlands \nand Europe, against which the remuneration proposals \nfor\xc2\xa0the former Managing Board were assessed. In recent \nyears, however, the many changes that have occurred \nin\xc2\xa0the banking industry in the Netherlands have made \nit\xc2\xa0difficult to properly assess the Managing Board\xe2\x80\x99s \nremuneration packages as such changes have not \nnecessarily affected companies in the general industry \nor\xc2\xa0the financial industry outside the Netherlands. \nThis\xc2\xa0currently makes benchmark comparisons difficult, \nif\xc2\xa0not impossible. As in 2017, therefore, the benchmark \ncomparisons were not a leading factor in the process of \nfixing the new Executive Board annual salaries in 2018. \nThese remained at the same level as in 2017 except for a \nminor collective adjustment (described below). The fixed \n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership structureGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalAnnual Financial StatementsOtherLeadership & governance\x0cLeadership & governance  /  Remuneration report\n\n147\n\nremuneration for the five members of ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s \nExecutive Committee has been set on the basis of \nthe\xc2\xa0Executive Board salaries and reflects the various \nresponsibilities of the Executive Committee members. \nThe\xc2\xa0new salary framework of the Executive Committee \nmembers became effective on the starting date of their \nappointments, 1 March 2017.\n\nDetails of the remuneration of the individual members \nof\xc2\xa0the Executive Board and of the Executive Committee \nmembers are provided in note 35 and note 36 respectively \nin the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements.\n\nAnnual fixed remuneration for 2018\nThe annual base salary for the Executive Board members \nfollows the developments in the Collective Labour \nAgreement for the banking industry (CAO Banken). For the \nyear 2018, a collective salary increase of 1.5% applied.\xc2\xa0 \n \nThe three members of the Executive Board each earn the \nsame salary which, for 2018, amounted to EUR\xc2\xa0614,075 \ngross per annum. The differential between the salary of \nthe Chairman of the Executive Board, Mr Kees van \nDijkhuizen, and the other members is 15%. His salary for \n2018 amounted to EUR\xc2\xa0723,358.\n\nIn February 2019, a new Collective Labour Agreement \nfor\xc2\xa0the banking industry was concluded for the years  \n2019-2020. This provides for two collective salary \nincreases, each of 2.5%, from 1 January 2019 and \n1\xc2\xa0January 2020 respectively.  \n \nThe Chairman of the Executive Board\xe2\x80\x99s 2019 salary will \nbe\xc2\xa0EUR\xc2\xa0741,442 gross, while the members of the \nExecutive Board will each receive an annual salary of \nEUR\xc2\xa0629,427 gross.\xc2\xa0\n\nVariable remuneration\nThe remuneration package for members of the Executive \nBoard provides for a variable compensation component. \nHowever, the prohibition on bonuses that became \neffective in 2011 and, since 7 February 2015, has been \nincorporated into Article 1:128 Financial Supervision Act \ndoes not allow such compensation to be paid to board \nmembers of financial institutions falling under the scope \nof the Financial Supervision Act during the period\xc2\xa0the \nDutch State provides support through a shareholding \nin\xc2\xa0the institution. Consequently no benchmark scenario \nanalysis was undertaken. The members of the Executive \nBoard are therefore not entitled to receive variable \nremuneration during the period of state ownership. \nThis\xc2\xa0continued to apply in the 2018 performance year. \nExecutive Board members consequently do not participate \nin the Variable Compensation Plan applying to all Identified \nStaff within ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO.\xc2\xa0\n\nBenefits\nThe Chairman and members of the Executive Board \nparticipate in the ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO pension schemes applicable \nto all employees in the Netherlands, whereby it should \nbe\xc2\xa0noted that Mr Clifford Abrahams is not a Dutch tax \nresident. For pensionable salary up to the applicable \nthreshold, which for 2018 amounted to EUR\xc2\xa0105,075, \na\xc2\xa0collective defined contribution (CDC) pension scheme \napplies. From 2018, the standard retirement age is 68, \nwhile the average income accrual is 1.875% and the \nemployee pension contribution is 5.5%. For pensionable \nsalary in excess of EUR\xc2\xa0105,075, employees receive an \nallowance that can be used to build up a net pension in a \ndefined contribution (DC) plan. The allowance amounted to \n34% in 2018. The allowance is set annually, based on the \nyear-end interest in the preceding calendar year.\xc2\xa0In \naddition to pension benefits, Executive Board members \nare eligible for benefits such as a company car and a \nchauffeur.\xc2\xa0\n\nSeverance\xc2\xa0\nThe remuneration policy for Managing Board members \nforesees in a severance payment equal to one year\xe2\x80\x99s \ngross\xc2\xa0salary in the event of their employment contract \nbeing terminated at ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s initiative. The current \nExecutive Board members all have the same contractual \nright to a severance payment equal to three months\xe2\x80\x99 gross \nfixed salary. In 2018, Mr Johan van Hall, as a former \nManaging Board member, was awarded a severance \npayment on his\xc2\xa0departure. Contrary to his contractual \nentitlement as a former Managing Board member, the \nseverance payment made to Mr van Hall equalled three \nmonths\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0gross fixed salary, as applicable to the current \nExecutive Board members.\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0\n\nAppointment period\nThe appointment term for Executive Board members is, \nin\xc2\xa0principle, set at three years. Mr van Dijkhuizen was \nappointed CEO and Chairman on 1 January 2017. \nMr\xc2\xa0Clifford Abrahams was appointed an Executive Board \nmember and CFO on 1 September 2017 and has acted as \nVice-Chairman since 1 March 2018 as the successor of \nthe former Managing Board member, Johan van Hall. \nMs\xc2\xa0Tanja Cuppen was appointed an Executive Board \nmember on 1 October 2017 and became CRO on \n1\xc2\xa0November 2017. Mr Christian Bornfeld was appointed \nan\xc2\xa0Executive Board member and CI&TO on 1 March 2018. \nThe appointment terms for all current Executive Board \nmembers have been contractually agreed to be three \nyears, with the appointment ending at the close of the \nfirst General Meeting held after the three-year term has \nexpired. Reappointment is possible.\xc2\xa0\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadershipGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalAnnual Financial StatementsOtherLeadership & governance\x0cLeadership & governance  /  Remuneration report\n\n148\n\nExecutive Board 2018 performance\nThe Supervisory Board assessed the Executive Board \nmembers\xe2\x80\x99 performance and concluded that the set \nperformance targets for 2018 were well met.\xc2\xa0The average \nperformance outcome was above target, based on a set \nof financial and non-financial performance indicators as \nwell as individual leadership.\xc2\xa0Owing to the applicable \nprohibition on bonuses, the members of the Executive \nBoard are not eligible to receive variable remuneration \nlinked to their performance during 2018.\xc2\xa0\n\nIdentified Staff remuneration\nRemuneration restrictions apply not only to the Executive \nBoard, but also to those staff whose professional activities \ncould have a material impact on the bank\xe2\x80\x99s risk profile \n(\xe2\x80\x98Identified Staff\xe2\x80\x99). Within ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO, the group of \nIdentified Staff consists of:\n \xc3\x85 Members of the Executive and Supervisory Boards;\n \xc3\x85 Members of the Executive Committee;\n \xc3\x85 Members who fulfil an Executive Committee -1 or -2 \n\nposition at above-CLA level;\n\n \xc3\x85 Staff responsible for independent control functions;\n \xc3\x85 Other risk takers. The definition of the group of other \nrisk takers follows from their impact on the economic \ncapital of ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO (EC threshold), membership of \ncertain Risk Committees, having credit authority above \na certain threshold and fulfilling specific roles;\xc2\xa0\n\n \xc3\x85 Other employees whose total remuneration takes \nthem into the same remuneration bracket as senior \nmanagers and risk takers.\xc2\xa0       \n\nComposition of remuneration packages\n       In general, the remuneration packages for Identified Staff \nhave been structured in accordance with the various \nregulations and restrictions for the financial sector. \nA\xc2\xa0typical remuneration package for Identified Staff \nconsists of the following components:       \n \xc3\x85 Annual base salary;\n \xc3\x85 Annual variable remuneration (with deferred \n\npayout in\xc2\xa0alignment with the ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Variable \nCompensation Plan);\n\n \xc3\x85 Benefits and other entitlements.\n\n ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO strives to position the level of total direct \ncompensation for the Executive Committee members and \nthe Executive Committee -1 and -2 positions just below \nthe market median levels. In alignment with the Act on \nthe Remuneration Policy for Financial Undertakings \n(Wbfo), which came into force in 2015, the variable \ncompensation for this group of employees is capped at \n20% of base salary for those employed in the \nNetherlands. In addition, and also with effect from 2015, \nthe further remuneration restrictions, including the \nprohibition on bonuses, were extended to a specific group \nof senior employees as defined in the Wbf       o. Accordingly, \nthese senior employees, comprising the five Executive \n\nCommittee members, are also not allowed to be granted \nany variable remuneration until the Dutch State no longer \nholds an interest in ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO.\n\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s Collective Labour Agreement (CLA) governs \nthe remuneration packages for Identified Staff based in \nthe Netherlands unless they have been appointed to a \npositions to which the CLA does not apply, such as the \nExecutive Committee -1 and -2 groups of employees. \nFor\xc2\xa0Identified Staff based outside the Netherlands, \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO takes the relevant business dynamics \n(e.g.\xc2\xa0market conditions, local labour and tax legislation) \ninto account when deciding on the composition of the \nreward packages. For the latter two categories of \nemployees, the total direct compensation is aimed to be \npositioned around the median levels in the relevant \nmarket. The maximum variable compensation percentage \nfor employees working outside the Netherlands in another \nEuropean Economic Area (\xe2\x80\x98EEA\xe2\x80\x99) state is 100%; for \nemployees working outside the EEA more than 100% is \nallowed, with a maximum of 200% and subject to \nshareholder approval. These percentages are aligned to \nthe international market environment in which we operate.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\nUntil 14 December 2018 (the date on which the Private \nEquity Business was sold), special plans existed for \ncertain key investment professionals within Private Equity. \nKey investment professionals were able to participate in \nprivate equity funds where separate performance-related \nincentives (\xe2\x80\x98carried interest\xe2\x80\x99) had been agreed upon. \nCarried interest became payable only after the relevant \nprivate equity fund had first returned all the capital \ncontributed by ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO plus an amount of profits at \nan\xc2\xa0agreed hurdle rate. Carried interest entitlement was \nawarded at the initiation of the private equity fund \ncontrolled by ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO. The value of this entitlement \nover the paid-up amount by the investment professionals \nwas treated as variable compensation at the time of being \ngranted. Subsequent changes in value were treated as \nthird-party minority interests in the funds and reflected \nas\xc2\xa0other non-controlling interests in the consolidated \nincome statement (see page 154). We also refer to the \nconsolidated statement of changes in equity on page 157. \nCarried interest was subject to \xe2\x80\x98good and bad leaver\xe2\x80\x99 \narrangements, as set out in the relevant agreement, to \ndiscourage malfeasance. Claw-back provisions were also \nin place.    Due to the sale of the Private Equity business, \nthe carried interest schemes no longer exist at \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO. \n\nPerformance is measured during a one-year performance \nperiod at three levels: group, business unit and individual \nlevel, and by means of (partly) risk-adjusted financial and \nnon-financial performance indicators.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership structureGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalAnnual Financial StatementsOtherLeadership & governance\x0cLeadership & governance  /  Remuneration report\n\n149\n\nPerformance indicators for Identified Staff\n\nWeighting  \n Executive Board5\n\nWeighting  \n Executive Committee\n\nWeighting above CLA \nidentified staff\n\nWeighting CLA \nidentified staff\n\nOrganisation level KPIs\nBusinessline level KPIs\nIndividual KPI1\nTotal\n- of which financial2 , 3\n- of which non-financial3 , 4\n\n40-70%\n0-30%\n30%\n100%\n20-40%\n60-80%\n\n20-40%\n30-50%\n30%\n100%\n20-30%\n70-80%\n\n20%\n50%\n30%\n100%\n20-30%\n70-80%\n\nIndividual KPI: For employees above CLA the individual KPI refers to leadership.\n1 \n2  Financial KPIs include revenue growth, cost ceiling, RARORAC and CET1 ratio. \n3  Non financial KPIs include sustainability, Net Promoter Score, Employee Engagement, House in order, Cultural transformation and Bank broad innovation.\n4  Mix and weighting of KPIs tailored to specific function of the identified staff member.\n5  The CEO only has KPIs on Individual and Organisation level.\n\nVariable remuneration\n(in %)\n\n100\n\n80\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\nVariable remuneration of Identified Staff\nAll variable remuneration awards for Identified Staff are \nsubject to, and structured in accordance with, the Variable \nCompensation Plan. Before any variable remuneration is \ngranted, ABN AMRO applies an ex-ante risk assessment \nconsisting of collective quantitative risk adjustment \nmechanisms (such as the solvency check) and a qualitative \nindividual check (the gatekeeper). The gatekeeper \nprocedure forms part of the performance management \nframework and provides for an assessment of each \nindividual Identified Staff member by the control functions \n(Risk, Compliance and Audit) on the basis of several \nbehavioural elements. This assessment results in advice \nto the Executive Board, which ultimately decides on \nwhether variable compensation can indeed be granted to \nthe Identified Staff member concerned. The Executive \nBoard\xe2\x80\x99s decision must be formally approved by the \nSupervisory Board, based on the advice of the \nRemuneration, Selection & Nomination Committee.\xc2\xa0For \n2018 it was decided not to apply gatekeeper adjustments.\xc2\xa0 \nThe variable remuneration is awarded over time and split \nbetween an up-front portion (60%) and a deferred portion \n(40%), with all portions divided equally between a cash \nand a non-cash instrument, as shown in the following chart.\n\n10%\n15%\n75%\n100%\n0-50%\n50-100%\n\n100\n\n20\n\n20\n\n30\n\n30\n\nt=1\n\nt=2\n\nt=3\n\nt=4\n\nt=5\n\nt=6\n\nTotal\n\nUp-front cash1\nUp-front non-cash1, 3\n\n \n\nDeferred non-cash2, 3\n \nDeferred cash2\n\n1  The up-front payment (60% in total) is awarded in March following the relevant \n  performance year.\n2  The deferred award (40% in total) vests in three separate tranches respectively \n  1, 2 and 3 years after the end of the relevant performance year. \n3  All non-cash awards are subject to a two year retention period.     \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nUp-front variable remuneration is awarded in the first \nquarter of the year following the relevant performance \nyear, while deferred variable remuneration vests in equal \ninstalments in the three years following the first payment. \nThis remuneration will vest only after an explicit ex-post \nrisk assessment: the \xe2\x80\x98malus assessment\xe2\x80\x99 (see the ex-post \nrisk adjustment tools paragraph).\n \nThe Supervisory Board approval of the new Variable \nCompensation Plan on is expected mid March 2019. \nSince\xc2\xa0the awards reflecting the 2016 performance year, \nthe instrument underlying the non-cash award has \nconsisted of an award in the form of a Depositary Receipt \n(DR) Award, which is a conditional right to receive DRs. \nOne DR represents one share in ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO. The value \ntherefore fluctuates in line with the market price of the \nDRs and its use will result in an increased alignment \nbetween remuneration and shareholder value for all \nparticipants in the Variable Compensation Plan.   \n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadershipGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalAnnual Financial StatementsOtherLeadership & governance\x0cLeadership & governance  /  Remuneration report\n\n150\n\nVariable income awards with respect to the performance \nyears up to and including 2015 will continue to use \nperformance certificates, the value of which fluctuates in \nline with the net asset value of ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO.\n\n \xc3\x85 the second tranche of deferred variable compensation \n\nfor the 2016 performance period;\n\n \xc3\x85 the first tranche of deferred variable compensation for \n\nthe 2017 performance period.\xc2\xa0       \n\nA two-year retention period applies to the non-cash \ninstruments. Any unconditional instrument will therefore \nneed to be retained for a further two years.      \n\nThe malus assessment is conducted by the Risk, \nCompliance, HR, Finance and Audit control functions, \nand any outcome is subject to approval by the Executive \nBoard and Supervisory Board. This assessment includes \ndetermining whether any new information is available that \nprevents the vesting of deferred remuneration.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \n \nThis could include: \nEvidence of misconduct or serious error by the staff \nmember (e.g. breach of a code of conduct or other internal \nrules, especially concerning risks);\n \xc3\x85 The institution or the business unit subsequently \n\nsuffers a significant downturn in its financial \nperformance (specific indicators must be used);\n \xc3\x85 The institution or the business unit in which the \n\nIdentified Staff member works suffers a significant \nfailure of risk management;\n\n \xc3\x85 Significant changes in the institution\xe2\x80\x99s economic or \n\nregulatory capital base.   \n\nThe Supervisory Board decided that, on the basis of the \nreassessment performed by the control functions, there \nwas no reason to apply a collective malus with respect\xc2\xa0to \nthe vesting of:\n \xc3\x85 the third tranche of deferred variable compensation for \n\nthe 2015 performance period;\n\n       In five individual cases, the Supervisory Board decided to \napply a malus with respect to the vesting of any remaining \ndeferred variable compensation for the 2015 and 2016 \nperformance period. This affects two employees for a \ntotal\xc2\xa0outstanding amount of EUR 36 thousand. \n \nThe other deferred variable compensation awards with \nrespect to the above three performance years will now be \ngranted to the relevant Identified Staff members in line \nwith the rules of the Variable Compensation Plan.\xc2\xa0 \n \nThe Supervisory Board has discretionary power to reduce \nany variable compensation to a suitable amount if, in its \nopinion, payment of the compensation would be \nunacceptable under the principle of reasonableness and \nfairness. The Supervisory Board is also authorised to \nreclaim any variable remuneration for any performance \nperiod if the award, calculation or payment was based on \nincorrect data or if, in hindsight, the performance \nconditions were not achieved. The recipient will then be \nobliged to repay the relevant amount to the bank.        \n\nLastly, personal hedging or insurance linked to \nremuneration and liability in order to circumvent the risk \ncontrol effects that have been embedded in the variable \ncompensation plan is not permitted.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\nDetails of remuneration\nRemuneration comprises fixed and variable compensation, \nemployer pension contributions and sign-on, and retention \nand severance pay for 2018.\xc2\xa0\n\nRemuneration details of Identified Staff\n\n(in thousands)\n\nRetail Banking\nCommercial Banking\nPrivate Banking\nCorporate & Institutional Banking\nGroup Functions2\nTotal\n\nNumber of FTE \n(Identified Staff)3\n\n32\n48\n40\n108\n143\n371\n\n2018\nAggregated \n remuneration\n\n9,203\n12,316\n15,848\n41,982\n42,271\n121,619\n\nNumber of FTE \n(Identified Staff)3\n\n23\n33\n47\n148\n153\n404\n\n2017\nAggregated \n remuneration\n\n8,836\n10,050\n20,660\n51,198\n40,633\n131,377\n\n1  Employer pension contribution was not included in the remuneration. \n2  Executive and Supervisory Board members are reported under Group Functions.\n3  The number of FTE includes all employees that were Identfied Staff during the year (including leavers).\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership structureGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalAnnual Financial StatementsOtherLeadership & governance\x0cLeadership & governance  /  Remuneration report\n\n151\n\n(in thousands)\n\nFixed remuneration over 2018\nVariable remuneration over 20181\n- of which in cash\n- of which in performance certificates\n- of which unconditional (up-front payment)\n- of which conditional (deferred payment)\nRetention payments over 2018\nSign on payments over 2018\nSeverance payments over 20182\n\nNumber of FTEs (identified staff)\n\nExBo, ExCo,  \nExCo1 and ExCo2\n\n165\n103\n\n1\n\n20\n\nOther\n\n206\n93\n\n1\n\nAggregated \n r emuneration\n\n110,089\n11,530\n3,468\n3,455\n6,923\n4,607\n53\n212\n8,964\n\n1  Certain variable compensation elements are, due to their specific nature, paid out in cash and are not or only partially subject to deferral.\n2  Highest severance pay amounted EUR\xc2\xa01,050,000.\n\nRemuneration details of all employees1\n\n(in FTE)\n\nRetail Banking\nCommercial Banking\nPrivate Banking\nCorporate & Institutional Banking\nGroup Functions1\n\n1-1.5\n\n1.5-2\n\n2-2.5\n\n2.5-3\n\n3-3.5\n\n2\n\nRemuneration in\xc2\xa0millions2\n>5\n\n4.5-5\n\n3.5-4\n\n1  Executive and Supervisory Board members are reported under Group Functions.\n2  Remuneration reflects the amounts paid in the financial year as per EBA requirement, as opposed to the remuneration disclosure in note 35 Remuneration of Executive Board \n\nand\xc2\xa0Supervisory Board which represents the remuneration allocated to the financial year in accordance with EU IFRS.\n\nThe variable remuneration awarded to all employees \nincluding Identified Staff, for 2018 amounted to \nEUR\xc2\xa079\xc2\xa0million.\n\n(in FTE)\n\n1-1.5\n\n1.5-2\n\n2-2.5\n\n2.5-3\n\n3-3.5\n\nExecutive Board/Executive Committee\nExecutive Committee -1 and -2 above CLA\nOther Identified Staff\n\n2\n\nRemuneration in\xc2\xa0millions1\n>5\n\n4.5-5\n\n3.5-4\n\n1  Remuneration reflects the amounts paid in the financial year as per EBA requirement, as opposed to the remuneration disclosure in note 35 Remuneration of Executive Board \n\nand\xc2\xa0Supervisory Board which represents the remuneration allocated to the financial year in accordance with EU IFRS.\n\nThe ratio of the mean annual employee compensation and \nthe total annual remuneration of the CEO in 2018 was 9.6, \nslightly lower than in 2017.

The operating activities fluctuated mostly as a result \nof\xc2\xa0changes in derivatives, securities financing and due to banks.

This section describes ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group\xe2\x80\x99s \nsignificant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates or judgements relating to the Annual Financial \nStatements. If an accounting policy or a\xc2\xa0critical accounting estimate relates to a\xc2\xa0specific note, it is included within \nthe\xc2\xa0relevant note.\n\nCorporate information\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group N.V. (referred to as ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group or the parent company) is the parent company of \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xc2\xa0Bank N.V. and a\xc2\xa0related consolidated group of companies (referred to as the Group or ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO). \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group is a\xc2\xa0public limited liability company, incorporated under Dutch law on 18 December 2009, and \nregistered at Gustav Mahlerlaan 10, 1082 PP Amsterdam, the Netherlands (Chamber of Commerce number 34370515).\n\nAs at 31 December 2018, all shares in the capital of ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group were held by two foundations: NLFI and \nSTAK\xc2\xa0AAG. On that date, NLFI held 56.3% in ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO, of which 49.9% is directly held via ordinary shares and 6.4% \nis indirectly held via depositary receipts for shares in ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO. STAK\xc2\xa0AAG held 50.1% of the shares in the issued \ncapital of ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group N.V. Both foundations have issued depositary receipts for shares in ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group. \nOnly STAK\xc2\xa0AAG\xe2\x80\x99s depositary receipts are issued with the cooperation of ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group and traded on Euronext \nAmsterdam.\n\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO provides a\xc2\xa0broad range of financial services to retail, private and corporate banking clients. These activities \nare conducted primarily in the Netherlands and selectively abroad.\n\nThe Consolidated Annual Financial Statements of ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group for the annual period ended 31 December 2018 \nincorporate financial information of ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group N.V., its controlled entities, interests in associates and joint \nventures. The Annual Financial Statements were prepared by the Executive Board and authorised for issue by the \nSupervisory Board and Executive Board on 12 March 2019.\n\nStatement of compliance\nThe Consolidated Annual Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting \nStandards (IFRS), as endorsed by the European Union (EU). They also comply with the financial reporting requirements \nincluded in Title 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, as far as applicable.\n\nBasis of preparation\nThe Consolidated Annual Financial Statements are prepared on a\xc2\xa0historical cost basis, except for derivative financial \ninstruments, financial assets and liabilities held for trading or designated as measured at fair value through profit or loss, \nfinancial instruments not held in a\xc2\xa0hold to collect business model, debt instruments that do not meet the solely \npayments of principal and interest (SPPI) test, and equity investments in associates of a\xc2\xa0private equity nature, all of \nwhich are measured at fair value. The carrying values of recognised assets and liabilities that are hedged items in fair \nvalue hedges, and otherwise carried at amortised cost, are adjusted to record changes in fair value attributable to the \nrisks that are being hedged. Associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.\n\nOn 13 February 2019, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO announced its intention to simplify the group structure by executing a\xc2\xa0legal merger \nbetween ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Bank N.V. (ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Bank) and ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group N.V. (ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group). As a\xc2\xa0result of the \nproposed merger, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group will cease to exist. Shareholders in ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group will consequently become \nshareholders in ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Bank, while shares in ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Bank will be represented by depositary receipts, through \nwhich\xc2\xa0the listing on Euronext Amsterdam will be retained. Holders of debt instruments will continue to hold instruments \nissued by ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Bank. The legal merger has no material effect on equity. Subject to all the necessary approvals, \nincluding regulatory approvals, the merger is expected to be executed during 2019. The activities of ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group \nwill be integrated and continued in ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Bank. Therefore the Annual Financial Statements are\xc2\xa0prepared under the \ngoing concern assumption.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadershipGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceOtherAnnual Financial Statements\x0cAnnual Financial Statements 2018  /  Notes to the Consolidated Annual\xc2\xa0Financial\xc2\xa0Statements\n\n162\n\nThe Annual Financial Statements are presented in euros, which is the reporting currency of ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO, rounded to the \nnearest\xc2\xa0million (unless otherwise stated).\n\nChanged presentation\xc2\xa0of due to banks and due to customers\nIn 2018 ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO changed presentation of deposits included in due to banks (see note 26) and due to customers (see \nnote 27) to better align with regulatory guidance and market practices.\n\nThe change in presentation did not impact the measurement of these line items, retained earnings or the result for any \nperiod. The comparative figures have been adjusted accordingly. As a\xc2\xa0result, the following definitions apply to the new \npresentation of due to banks and due to customers:\n \xc3\x85 Current accounts include amounts held at ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO which are available to the owner for the execution of payment \n\ntransactions.\n\n \xc3\x85 Demand deposits are available to the account owner for frequent and immediate access, but cannot be used for \n\npayment transactions. As these deposits are on demand, they can be drawn or transferred by the client without prior \nnotice to the bank.\n\n \xc3\x85 Time deposits are not available to the account owner for immediate access and have an agreed maturity. In special \n\ncircumstances, early withdrawal may be permitted at a\xc2\xa0penalty payable by the account owner.\n\n \xc3\x85 Cash collateral on securities lent\xc2\xa0includes payables for cash collateral received in derivatives transactions.\n\nThe table below provides an overview of the changed presentation of due to banks and due to customers following from \nthe new definitions applied:\n\nDue to banks\nCurrent accounts\nDemand deposits\nTime deposits\nCash collateral on securities lent\nOther deposits\nOther\nTotal due to banks\nDue to customers\nCurrent accounts\nDemand deposits\nSaving deposits\nTime deposits\nOther\nTotal due to customers\n\n31 December 2017\nPrevious presentation\nCarrying amount\n\nChanges in presentation\n\n1 January 2018\nNew presentation\nCarrying amount\n\n2,539\n1,083\n\n12,817\n23\n16,462\n\n127,675\n95,751\n13,274\n\n236,699\n\n2,588\n-2,508\n10,064\n2,673\n-12,817\n\n83,627\n-1,680\n-95,751\n13,262\n541\n\n2,588\n31\n11,147\n2,673\n\n23\n16,462\n\n83,627\n125,995\n\n26,536\n541\n236,699\n\nCurrent accounts have been redefined to include products that were previously reported under demand deposits. \nSaving\xc2\xa0deposits are recorded under demand deposits and time deposits.\n\nReclassification of unsettled securities transactions\nAs at 1 January 2018, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO reclassified all unsettled securities transactions previously included in securities \nfinancing as other assets and other liabilities. These assets were reclassified to reflect their nature as they comprise \nunsettled securities transactions and therefore do not necessarily relate to securities financing. As at 1 January 2018, \nEUR\xc2\xa01.0\xc2\xa0billion of assets were reclassified from securities financing to other assets, while liabilities totalling \nEUR\xc2\xa01.5\xc2\xa0billion were reclassified from securities financing to other liabilities. The comparative figures have been \nadjusted\xc2\xa0accordingly.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership structureGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceOtherAnnual Financial Statements\x0cAnnual Financial Statements 2018  /  Notes to the Consolidated Annual\xc2\xa0Financial\xc2\xa0Statements\n\n163\n\nReclassification for interest income related to derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting\nIn 2018, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO changed the presentation of interest income from derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting from \n\xe2\x80\x98Interest income from financial instruments measured at amortised cost and fair value through other comprehensive \nincome\xe2\x80\x99 to \xe2\x80\x98Interest income from financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss\xe2\x80\x99. The comparatives \nhave been adjusted accordingly. The interest income has been reclassified due to the amendment that IFRS 9 made to \nIAS 1. For the year 2018, EUR\xc2\xa01.9 billion has been reclassified (2017: EUR\xc2\xa01.9 billion).\n\n       Restatement of committed credit facilities\nDuring the second half of 2018 ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO assessed the application of its definitions relating to committed and \nuncommitted credit facilities. This resulted in an increase in committed credit facilities. Adjusting the comparative figures \nresulted in an increase of EUR\xc2\xa022.5\xc2\xa0billion as at 31 December 2017. The change did not impact retained earnings, the \nresult or the total assets and liabilities for any period.\n\nDisclosures\nTo combine disclosures, and to reduce duplication, we have integrated some IFRS disclosures into our Executive Board \nreport. These are:\n \xc3\x85 IFRS 7 Risk disclosures of financial instruments. These are disclosed in the Risk, funding and capital section;\n \xc3\x85 IAS 1 Capital disclosures. These are part of the Risk, funding and capital section.\n\nIFRS disclosures in the Risk, funding and capital section are labelled as \xe2\x80\x98audited\xe2\x80\x99. These disclosures are an integral part \nof\xc2\xa0the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements and are covered by the Auditor\xe2\x80\x99s report.\n\nChanges in accounting policies\nNew EU-endorsed standards became effective as at 1 January 2018. The following standards were adopted:\n\nIFRS 9 Financial instruments\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO adopted IFRS 9 Financial Instruments as at 1 January 2018. IFRS 9 was issued by the IASB in July 2014 and \nendorsed by the EU in November 2016. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO has applied the principles of IFRS 9 retrospectively from 1 January \n2018 onwards. Prior years have not been restated in line with the transitional provisions of the standard. IFRS 9 replaces \nIAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and includes requirements for the classification and \nmeasurement (C&M) of financial instruments, impairment of financial assets, and hedge accounting.\n\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO has decided to continue applying IAS 39 for hedge accounting and the application of the EU carve-out. See \nthe IFRS 9 transition disclosures in this note for details of the transitional impact of IFRS 9.\n\nClassification and measurement       \nThe classification and measurement of financial assets under IFRS 9 is determined by the business model in which the \nassets are held and whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI). Under IFRS \n9, financial assets can be measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) or fair \nvalue through profit or loss (FVTPL). These categories replace the IAS 39 classifications of loans and receivables (L&R), \navailable-for-sale (AFS), FVTPL, and held-to-maturity.\n\nAs part of the transition to IFRS 9, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO has performed an analysis of the business models and contractual cash \nflows of all financial asset portfolios. This has resulted in a\xc2\xa0number of changes. Additional information on these changes \nis provided in the IFRS 9 transition disclosure.\n\nClassification and measurement of financial liabilities has largely remained unchanged except for financial liabilities \nmeasured at FVTPL. Changes in fair value attributable to changes in the credit risk of such liabilities are presented in \nother comprehensive income. This resulted in a\xc2\xa0transfer from retained earnings to accumulated other comprehensive \nincome as at 1 January 2018. The cumulative amount of changes in fair value attributable to the credit risk of issued debt \nis presented as liability own credit risk reserve in equity.\n\nThe IFRS 9 classification and measurement accounting policies of ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO are explained in the section on significant \naccounting policies in this note.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadershipGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceOtherAnnual Financial Statements\x0cAnnual Financial Statements 2018  /  Notes to the Consolidated Annual\xc2\xa0Financial\xc2\xa0Statements\n\n164\n\nImpairments\nIFRS 9 replaced the incurred loss model with the expected credit loss (ECL) model, which is designed to be forward-\nlooking. The IFRS 9 impairment requirements are applicable to financial assets measured at amortised cost and FVOCI. \nAdditionally, the scope of the IFRS 9 impairment requirements is broader than under IAS 39 as loan commitments \nand financial guarantee contracts are also included. The financial instruments in scope of the IFRS 9 impairment \nrequirements are divided into three groups, depending on the stage of credit quality deterioration:\n \xc3\x85 Financial instruments without a\xc2\xa0significant increase in credit risk (stage 1): the portion of the lifetime expected credit \nlosses associated with default events occurring in the next twelve months (12M ECL) is recognised.

Certain portfolios of corporate loans have embedded derivatives that were bifurcated under IAS 39. These are loans where the return is based on the price of underlying \n\ncommodity contracts or loans with a floating interest rate, and where the interest reset period does not match the interest reference rate. These contracts were analysed in \ntheir\xc2\xa0entirety in accordance with IFRS 9 and failed the solely payment of principal and interest (SPPI) criterion. As a result, the loans, together with the embedded derivatives \nthat were previously bifurcated, were reclassified as FVTPL at 1 January 2018. The amounts relating to the reclassification are EUR\xc2\xa01,929\xc2\xa0million for loans, EUR\xc2\xa0141\xc2\xa0million \nfor\xc2\xa0derivatives assets and EUR\xc2\xa025\xc2\xa0million for derivatives liabilities. As the fair value of these loans is EUR\xc2\xa033\xc2\xa0million below their carrying amount under IAS 39, this has resulted \nin a C&M remeasurement.\n\nb.  ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO has chosen not to select the FVOCI option under IFRS 9 for all equity securities. As a result, an amount of EUR\xc2\xa0415\xc2\xa0million has been reclassified from available- \n\nfor-sale (AFS) under IAS 39 to FVTPL under IFRS 9. In addition, the cumulative AFS reserve of EUR\xc2\xa042\xc2\xa0million (net of tax) relating to these equity securities reclassified to FVTPL \nhas been transferred to retained earnings.\xc2\xa0All AFS debt instruments were remeasured at FVOCI.\n\nc.  For a portfolio of corporate loans that had been reclassified from held for trading to loans and receivables in 2015, a revised amortised cost measurement has been applied in \naccordance with IFRS 9, as if these loans had always been measured at amortised cost. This resulted in a reduction in the carrying amounts of these loans at 1 January 2018, \nreflected as a C&M remeasurement of EUR\xc2\xa0190\xc2\xa0million negative in the above table.\n\nd.  The IFRS 9 impairment requirements resulted in ECL remeasurement of total assets by EUR\xc2\xa092\xc2\xa0million and of total liabilities by EUR\xc2\xa061\xc2\xa0million, largely as a result of a \nEUR\xc2\xa0141\xc2\xa0million impact on loans and advances to customers and a EUR\xc2\xa052\xc2\xa0million increase in tax assets. Allowances for irrevocable loan commitments and financial \nguarantees are included in provisions.\n\ne.  The tax effect recognised in tax assets is EUR\xc2\xa0108\xc2\xa0million.\nf.  IFRS 9 changes the measurement criteria for financial liabilities designated as FVTPL, as a result of which the cumulative change in the fair value attributable to changes \n\nin\xc2\xa0the credit risk of that liability are presented in accumulated other comprehensive income. This change resulted in the transfer of EUR\xc2\xa064\xc2\xa0million (net of tax) from retained \nearnings to accumulated other comprehensive income at 1 January 2018.\n\ng.  Allowances for credit losses of EUR\xc2\xa02\xc2\xa0million on FVOCI instruments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. These allowances for credit losses have \n\nno\xc2\xa0effect on the carrying value of FVOCI financial assets, which continue to be\xc2\xa0measured at fair value. The adoption of IFRS 9 resulted in a transfer of EUR\xc2\xa02\xc2\xa0million from \nthe\xc2\xa0fair value reserve to retained earnings to reflect the cumulative impairment recognised in profit or loss.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadershipGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceOtherAnnual Financial Statements\x0cAnnual Financial Statements 2018  /  Notes to the Consolidated Annual\xc2\xa0Financial\xc2\xa0Statements\n\n166\n\nThe tables below provide a reconciliation from the IAS 39 allowances/IAS 37 provisions to the IFRS 9 ECL allowances/\nprovisions recognised as at 1 January 2018 upon adoption of IFRS 9.\n\nTransition of on-balance sheet allowances\n\nFinancial investments1\nLoans and advances banks\nResidental mortgages\nConsumer loans\nCorporate loans (AC)\nOther loans\nLoans and advances customers\nTotal loans and advances\nOther assets\nTotal on-balance sheet allowances\n\nIAS 39\n31 December 2017\nAllowances for \ncredit losses\n\nMeasurement \nCategory\n\nIFRS 9\n1 January 2018\nAllowances for \ncredit losses\n\nMeasurement \nCategory\n\nRemeasurement\n\nAFS\nL&R\nAC\nAC\nAC\nAC\nL&R\n\nL&R\n\n7\n134\n304\n2,020\n2\n2,460\n2,467\n3\n2,470\n\n2\n48\n58\n36\n\n141\n143\n1\n144\n\n9\n182\n362\n2,055\n2\n2,601\n2,610\n4\n2,614\n\nFVOCI\nAC\nAC\nAC\nAC\nAC\nAC\n\nAC\n\n1  Allowances for credit losses of EUR\xc2\xa02\xc2\xa0million on FVOCI instruments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income.

transition to IFRS 9 has resulted in a\xc2\xa0decline in RWA-based capital ratios and leverage ratios. This impact is \nattributable to classification and measurement changes and risk-weighting of the related potential future tax savings. \nIn\xc2\xa0addition, the allowances for credit losses have increased due to IFRS 9, but the regulatory capital impact was more \nthan offset by a\xc2\xa0reversal in the IRB Provision Shortfall. Transition to IFRS 9 has resulted in a\xc2\xa0decrease of CET1 capital \nby\xc2\xa012bps. \n \nThe regulatory transitional arrangements which allow for gradual phasing-in of the negative impact on own funds will not \nbe applied by ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO due to the limited expected impact on CET1 capital. If future IFRS 9 credit loss allowances \nincrease significantly, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO may apply the transitional provisions, subject to prior permission from the ECB.\n\nIFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nThe IFRS 15 standard became effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. It establishes \na\xc2\xa0comprehensive framework for determining the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue from contracts with \ncustomers. \n\nAfter contracts and their performance obligations have been identified, revenue is recognised\xc2\xa0as an amount that reflects \nthe consideration to which the bank expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to \ncustomers. The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation.\xc2\xa0Revenue is recognised when a\xc2\xa0promised \ngood or service is transferred to the customer, either at a\xc2\xa0point in time or over time.\xc2\xa0ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO elected to apply the \nmodified retrospective approach in the transition to the new standard and uses practical expedients where applicable. \nThe standard introduced enhanced disclosures on fee and commission income, and had no further impact on \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s financial statements and comparative figures.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadershipGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceOtherAnnual Financial Statements\x0cAnnual Financial Statements 2018  /  Notes to the Consolidated Annual\xc2\xa0Financial\xc2\xa0Statements\n\n170\n\nIFRS 2 Share-based Payments\nIn June 2016 the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 2 Share-based Payments: Classification and Measurement of \nShare-based Payment Transactions. This comprised three amendments that clarify how to account for certain types of \nshare-based payment transactions. As ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO does not currently have any IFRS 2 share-based payment plans, \nthis\xc2\xa0amendment does not impact on ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO.\n\nAnnual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2014-2016 Cycle\nThis cycle of annual improvements comprises three amendments, one of which became effective on 1 January 2017. \nThis amendment relates to IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities and provides clarifications on the scope of \nthe standard. The other two amendments became effective on 1 January 2018. Neither amendment, IFRS 1 relating to \nFirst-Time Adoption and IAS 28 relating to Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures, had an impact on the financial \nstatements.\n\nNew standards, amendments and interpretations not yet effective\nThe following amendments to IFRS have been issued by the IASB and endorsed by the EU, but are not yet effective. \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO does not early apply these amendments. Note that only the amendments to IFRS that are relevant for \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO are discussed.\n\nIFRS 16 Leases\nThe new standard on leases was issued by the IASB in January 2016 and became effective on 1 January 2019. \nIFRS\xc2\xa016\xc2\xa0replaces IAS 17 Leases and removes the distinction between \xe2\x80\x98operating\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98finance\xe2\x80\x99 leases for lessees. \nThe\xc2\xa0requirements for lessor accounting remain largely unchanged.\n\nThe main impact of IFRS 16 on ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s financial statements is expected to arise from leases of office buildings \nand cars which the bank leases for its own use as lessee. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO has elected to apply the modified retrospective \napproach in the transition to the new standard and will use several of the practical expedients. The transition to IFRS 16 \nis estimated to result in an increase in assets and liabilities of approximately EUR\xc2\xa00.3\xc2\xa0billion. The expected impact on \nequity is not significant. Additional disclosures regarding both the lessor and lessee lease portfolios will be included in \nthe 2019 financial statements.\n\nAmendments to IFRS 9\nThe IASB issued amendments to IFRS 9, Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation, which became effective \non\xc2\xa01 January 2019. These amendments allow instruments with symmetric prepayment options to be measured at \namortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income. As ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO does not currently have any \nfinancial instruments with these features, these amendments do not have an impact.\n\nIAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures\nIn October 2017, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 28 that will become effective on 1 January 2019. The amendments \nstate that IFRS 9 should be applied to long-term interests in an associate or joint venture to which the equity method is \nnot applied. Based on our initial analysis, no impact on ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO is expected.\n\nNew standards, amendments and interpretations not yet endorsed\nThe following new or revised standards and amendments have been issued by the IASB, but have not yet been \nendorsed by the EU and are therefore not open for early adoption. Note that only the amendments to IFRS that are \nrelevant for ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO are discussed.\n\nAnnual Improvements 2015-2017 Cycle\nIn December 2017, the IASB issued the Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2015-2017 Cycle. These amendments \nare required to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. This cycle of annual improvements \ncomprises amendments relating to IFRS 3 Business Combinations, IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, IAS 12 Income Taxes \nand IAS 23 Borrowing Costs. The impact of the amendments on the financial statements is expected to be insignificant.\n\nIFRS 3 Business Combinations\nIn October 2018 the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations. The amendments resolve difficulties in \ndetermining whether an entity has acquired a\xc2\xa0business or a\xc2\xa0group of assets. The amendments are effective for business \ncombinations for which the acquisition date is on or after 1 January 2020. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO is currently assessing the impact \nof the amendments.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership structureGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceOtherAnnual Financial Statements\x0cAnnual Financial Statements 2018  /  Notes to the Consolidated Annual\xc2\xa0Financial\xc2\xa0Statements\n\n171\n\nDefinition of Material (IAS 1 and IAS 8)\nIn October 2018 the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IAS 8 Accounting \nPolicies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. The amendments revise the definition of material and align the \ndefinition across other IFRS publications. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO is currently assessing the impact of the amendments.\n\nCritical accounting estimates and judgements\nThe preparation of financial statements requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions concerning the future. Actual results may \ndiffer from those estimates and assumptions. Accounting policies for the most significant areas requiring management \nto make judgements and estimates that affect reported amounts and disclosures are made in the following sections:\n\nImpairment losses on loans and advances \nFair value of financial instruments \nIncome tax expense, tax assets and tax liabilities\xc2\xa0 \nImpairment of instruments measured at FVOCI\xc2\xa0 \nProvisions\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0  \nImpairment of goodwill \n\nRisk, funding & capital section\nnote 18\nnote 10\nnote 16\nnote 29\nnote 23\n\nAssessment of risks, rewards and control\nWhenever ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO is required to assess risks, rewards and control, when considering the recognition and \nderecognition of assets or liabilities and the consolidation or deconsolidation of subsidiaries, it may sometimes be \nrequired to use judgement. Although management uses its best knowledge of current events and actions in making \nsuch assessments, the actual risks, rewards and control may ultimately differ.\n\nSignificant accounting policies\nBasis of consolidation\nThe Consolidated Annual Financial Statements of ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group N.V. include the financial statements of the parent \ncompany and its controlled entities, thus incorporating the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xc2\xa0Group N.V. and its subsidiaries. Non-controlling interests (held by third parties) in both equity and \nresults\xc2\xa0of\xc2\xa0group companies are presented separately in the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements.\n\nSubsidiaries are included using the same reporting period and consistent accounting policies. Intercompany balances and \ntransactions, and any related unrealised gains and losses, are eliminated in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nUnrealised gains arising from transactions with associates and jointly controlled entities are eliminated to the extent \nof\xc2\xa0ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the entities. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence \nof impairment in the asset transferred.\n\nForeign currency\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO applies IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates. Transactions in foreign currencies are \ntranslated into euros at the rate prevailing on the transaction date. Foreign currency balances of monetary items are \ntranslated into euros at the period-end exchange rates. Exchange gains and losses on such balances are recognised in \nthe income statement.\n\nThe Consolidated Annual Financial Statements are stated in euros, which is the presentation and functional currency \nof\xc2\xa0ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO. The Group\xe2\x80\x99s foreign operations may have different functional currencies. The functional currency is the \ncurrency that best reflects the economic substance of the underlying event and circumstances relevant to that entity. \nPrior to consolidation (or equity accounting), the assets and liabilities of non-euro operations are translated at the closing \nrate, and items in the income statement and other comprehensive income are translated into euros at the rate prevailing \non the transaction dates. Exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign operations are included in the \ncurrency translation reserve within equity. These are transferred to the income statement when the Group loses control, \njoint control or significant influence over the foreign operation.\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities\nClassification and measurement of financial assets (applicable from 1 January 2018)\nUnder IFRS 9, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO classifies financial assets based on the business model in which they are held. The business \nmodel is determined at a\xc2\xa0portfolio level. Portfolios are based on how ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO as a\xc2\xa0group manages financial assets in \n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadershipGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceOtherAnnual Financial Statements\x0cAnnual Financial Statements 2018  /  Notes to the Consolidated Annual\xc2\xa0Financial\xc2\xa0Statements\n\n172\n\norder to achieve a\xc2\xa0particular business objective. The business model assessment is based on the level of sales, risk \nmanagement, performance evaluation and management compensation. Derecognition is used as a\xc2\xa0condition to \ndetermine whether a\xc2\xa0transaction results in a\xc2\xa0sale.\n\nThree business models are distinguished:\n \xc3\x85 \xe2\x80\x98Hold to collect\xe2\x80\x99 business model, in which cash flows are primarily generated by collecting contractual cash flows \n\nuntil maturity of the financial instrument. Sales can occur, as long as they are incidental, infrequent and insignificant. \nThe\xc2\xa0assessment of the frequency and significance of sales is determined for each underlying portfolio. Sales that \nresult from increases in the credit risk of the counterparty or take place close to maturity do not contradict the \n\xe2\x80\x98hold\xc2\xa0to collect\xe2\x80\x99 business model.\n\n \xc3\x85 \xe2\x80\x98Hold to collect and sell\xe2\x80\x99 business model, in which the selling of financial assets is integral to achieving the business \n\nobjective. In this business model, sales take place more frequently and have a\xc2\xa0greater value than in a\xc2\xa0business model \nwith an objective to hold to collect.\n\n \xc3\x85 \xe2\x80\x98Other\xe2\x80\x99 business models not meeting the criteria of the business models mentioned above, for example business \n\nmodels in which financial assets are managed with the objective of generating cash flows from\xc2\xa0sales (trading book) \nare managed on a\xc2\xa0fair value basis. Under these business models, the financial assets are measured at FVTPL.\n\nAfter the business model has been determined, the contractual cash flows of financial assets are assessed. \nDebt\xc2\xa0instruments can be classified at amortised cost or FVOCI only when the contractual cash flows are solely \npayments\xc2\xa0of principal and interest (SPPI). Contractual cash flows that are SPPI are consistent with a basic lending \narrangement in which consideration for the time value of money and credit risk are typically the most significant interest \nelements. Debt instruments that do not meet the SPPI requirements are mandatorily measured at FVTPL. Financial \nassets are assessed in their entirety, including any embedded derivatives that are not separated from the host contract.\n\nBased on the business model determined and the SPPI assessment, the following measurement categories are \nidentified under IFRS 9:\n \xc3\x85 Amortised cost \xe2\x80\x93 Financial instruments measured at amortised cost are debt instruments within a\xc2\xa0hold to collect \nbusiness model with fixed or determinable payments which meet the SPPI criteria. These instruments are initially \nmeasured at fair value (including transaction costs) and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective \ninterest rate method, with the periodic amortisation recorded in the income statement. Financial instruments \nmeasured at amortised cost are presented net of credit loss allowances in the Statement of financial position.\n\n \xc3\x85 FVTPL \xe2\x80\x93 Financial instruments measured at FVTPL include instruments held for trading, derivatives, equity \n\ninstruments for which the FVOCI option has not been elected and instruments whose cash flows do not meet the \nSPPI requirements. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are directly recognised in the income statement.\n \xc3\x85 FVOCI \xe2\x80\x93 Financial instruments measured at FVOCI are debt instruments which are held in a\xc2\xa0hold to collect and sell \n\nbusiness model and which meet the SPPI criteria. They are initially measured at fair value, with subsequent unrealised \nchanges recognised in other comprehensive income. Equity instruments for which the fair value option is elected are \nalso measured at FVOCI.\n\nReclassifications of financial assets are expected to be very infrequent and occur only when ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO changes its \nbusiness model for a\xc2\xa0certain portfolio of financial assets. No reclassifications occurred during the reporting period.\n\nPlease refer to pages 65 to 122 in the Risk, funding & capital section for our accounting policies on the measurement \nof\xc2\xa0expected credit losses on financial instruments measured at amortised cost and FVOCI.\n\nClassification and measurement of financial assets (applicable before 1 January 2018)\nBefore 1 January 2018, financial assets were classified, based on the criteria in IAS 39, as assets held for trading, \nfinancial investments, or loans and receivables. Their measurement and income recognition depended on the \nclassification of the financial assets. The following four groups were identified:\n \xc3\x85 Loans and receivables were non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that were not quoted in \n\nan active market. They generally arose when money or services were directly provided to a\xc2\xa0client with no intention of trading \nor selling the loan. They were initially measured at fair value (including transaction costs) and subsequently measured at \namortised cost using the effective interest rate method, with the periodic amortisation recorded in the income statement;\n\n \xc3\x85 Held-to-maturity investments were non-derivative financial assets that consisted of instruments quoted on an active \n\nmarket with fixed or determinable payments and a\xc2\xa0fixed maturity for which the positive intent and ability to hold to \nmaturity was demonstrated. They were initially measured at fair value (including transaction costs) and subsequently \nmeasured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, with the periodic amortisation recorded in the \nincome statement;\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership structureGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceOtherAnnual Financial Statements\x0cAnnual Financial Statements 2018  /  Notes to the Consolidated Annual\xc2\xa0Financial\xc2\xa0Statements\n\n173\n\n \xc3\x85 Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss included:\n\n \xc3\x85 financial assets held for trading;\n \xc3\x85 financial assets that ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO irrevocably designated at initial recognition to be held at fair value through profit \nor loss when the instruments were held to reduce an accounting mismatch, were managed on the basis of their \nfair value or included terms that had, by nature, substantive derivative characteristics;\n\n \xc3\x85 Available-for-sale financial assets were those assets that were otherwise not classified as loans and receivables, \n\nheld-to-maturity investments, financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss or financial assets held \nfor trading. They were initially measured at fair value, with subsequent changes recognised in other comprehensive \nincome.\n\nIf ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO reclassified a\xc2\xa0financial asset from held for trading, the financial asset was reclassified at its fair value and \nthis fair value became the new amortised cost. On the same date, a\xc2\xa0new effective interest was calculated.\n\nClassification of assets and liabilities held for trading\nIn both the current and prior reporting period a\xc2\xa0financial asset or financial liability is classified as held for trading if it is:\n \xc3\x85 Acquired or incurred principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing it in the near term;\n \xc3\x85 Part of a\xc2\xa0portfolio of identified financial instruments that are managed together and for which there is evidence of \n\na\xc2\xa0recent actual pattern of short-term profit taking; or\n\n \xc3\x85 A trading derivative (except for a\xc2\xa0derivative that is a\xc2\xa0designated and effective hedging instrument).\n\nClassification and measurement of financial liabilities\nFinancial liabilities are initially recognised at their fair value. Under both IFRS 9 and IAS 39, financial liabilities are \nclassified as subsequently measured at amortised cost, except for the following instruments:\n \xc3\x85 Financial liabilities held for trading are measured at fair value through profit or loss;\n \xc3\x85 Financial liabilities that ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO has irrevocably designated at initial recognition as held at fair value through profit \nor loss when the instruments are held to reduce an accounting mismatch are managed on the basis of their\xc2\xa0fair value \nor include terms that have derivative characteristics in nature.\n\nUnder IFRS 9, the changes in fair value attributable to changes in the credit risk of financial liabilities designated at FVTPL \nare presented in other comprehensive income. The cumulative amount of changes in fair value attributable to credit risk \nof such liabilities is presented as liability own credit risk reserve in equity.\n\nFinancial liabilities are never reclassified after initial recognition.\n\nRecognition and derecognition\nTraded instruments are recognised on the trade date, which is defined as the date on which ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO commits to \npurchase or sell the underlying instrument. If the settlement terms are non-standard, the commitment is accounted for \nas a\xc2\xa0derivative between the trade and settlement dates. Loans and advances are recognised when they are acquired or \nfunded by ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO and derecognised when settled. Issued debt is recognised when issued, and deposits are \nrecognised when the cash is deposited with ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO. Other financial assets and liabilities, including derivatives, \nare\xc2\xa0recognised when ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO becomes a\xc2\xa0party to the contractual provisions of the asset or liability.\n\nFinancial assets are derecognised when ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO loses control and the ability to obtain benefits from the contractual \nrights that comprise that asset. This occurs when the rights are realised or expire or when substantially all risks and \nrewards are transferred. Financial assets are also derecognised if the bank has neither transferred nor retained \nsubstantially all risks and rewards of ownership, but control has passed to the transferee.\n\nFinancial assets continue to be recognised in the balance sheet, and a\xc2\xa0liability recognised for the proceeds of any related \nfunding transaction, unless a\xc2\xa0fully proportional share of all or specifically identified cash flows are transferred to the \nlender without material delay and the lender\xe2\x80\x99s claim is limited to those cash flows, and substantially all the risks, rewards \nand control associated with the financial instruments have been transferred, in which case that proportion of the asset is \nderecognised.\n\nOn derecognition of a\xc2\xa0financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount and the sum of the consideration \nreceived and any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in \nthe\xc2\xa0income statement.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadershipGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceOtherAnnual Financial Statements\x0cAnnual Financial Statements 2018  /  Notes to the Consolidated Annual\xc2\xa0Financial\xc2\xa0Statements\n\n174\n\nWhen the contractual cash flows of a\xc2\xa0financial asset are renegotiated or otherwise modified (for example in forbearance \nmeasures), ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO analyses \xe2\x80\x93 in both qualitative and quantitative terms \xe2\x80\x93 whether the modification should be \naccounted for as derecognition. Generally a\xc2\xa010% difference in the present value of the cash flows between the initial \nand modified contract is accounted for as derecognition. Qualitative terms such as changes in the repayment schedule, \ncounterparty or currency could also result in derecognition. Derecognition is accounted for as an expiration of the \nfinancial asset and recognition of a\xc2\xa0new financial asset. The difference between the former carrying amount and the \ncarrying amount of the new financial asset is recognised in the income statement. If the modification does not result in \nderecognition, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO recalculates the gross carrying amount of the financial asset, based on the present value of \nthe renegotiated or modified contractual cash flows and discounted at the financial asset\xe2\x80\x99s original effective interest rate. \nThe effect is recognised and disclosed as a\xc2\xa0modification loss in the income statement.\n\nFinancial liabilities are derecognised when the liability has been settled, has expired or has been extinguished. \nAn\xc2\xa0exchange of an existing financial liability for a\xc2\xa0new liability with the same lender on substantially different terms, \nqualitatively and quantitatively (a 10% difference in the present value of the cash flows) is accounted for as an \nextinguishment of the original financial liability and recognition of a\xc2\xa0new financial liability. The difference between \nthe\xc2\xa0former amortised cost and the consideration paid is recognised in the income statement. Any subsequent resale \nis\xc2\xa0treated as a\xc2\xa0new issuance.\n\nClient clearing\nAs a\xc2\xa0general clearing member, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO provides clearing and settlement services to its clients for, among other \nthings, exchange traded derivatives.\n\nIn its capacity as a\xc2\xa0clearing member, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO guarantees the fulfilment of obligations towards central counterparty \nclearing houses (CCPs) of clients\xe2\x80\x99 transactions. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO is not liable to clients for the non-performance of the CCP. \nIn\xc2\xa0the event of a\xc2\xa0client defaulting, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO has the legal obligation to settle all the client\xe2\x80\x99s positions with the relevant \nCCPs, possibly at a\xc2\xa0loss. Possible losses arising from this guarantee might relate not only to a\xc2\xa0client\xe2\x80\x99s current positions, \nbut also to future trades of the client. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO receives and collects (cash) margins from clients, and remits these \nmargins to the relevant CCP in whole or in part. Given the stringent margin requirements set by the CCPs, possible \nfuture outflows of resources for new clearing transactions are considered close to zero.\n\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO does not reflect the exchange-traded derivatives cleared on behalf of clients in its financial statements. \nUnder normal circumstances, the guarantee has no fair value and is not recognised in the financial statements. The loss \nrecognition in the event of non-performance of a\xc2\xa0client will be in line with our contingent liabilities policy\xc2\xa0(see note 34).        \n\nOffsetting\nThe bank offsets financial assets and liabilities and the net amount reported in the Statement of financial position if it is \nlegally entitled to set off the recognised amounts and intends to settle on a\xc2\xa0net basis, or to realise the asset and settle \nthe liability simultaneously.\n\nStatement of cash flows\nFor the purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, freely available \nbalances with central banks and other banks, and net balances on current accounts with other banks with less than \nthree months maturity from the date of acquisition. The statement of cash flows, based on the indirect method of \ncalculating operating cash flows, gives details of the source of cash and cash equivalents which became available during \nthe year and the application of these cash and cash equivalents over the course of the year. The cash flows are analysed \ninto cash flows from operations, including banking activities, investment activities and financing activities. Movements in \nloans and advances and interbank deposits are included in the cash flow from operating activities. Investment activities \nare comprised of acquisitions, sales and redemptions in respect of financial investments, as well as investments in, and \nsales of, subsidiaries and associates, property and equipment. The issuing of shares and the borrowing and repayment \nof long-term funds are treated as financing activities. Cash flows arising from foreign currency transactions are translated \ninto euros using the exchange rates at the date of the cash flows.\n\nGovernment grants\nGovernment grants are recognised in the income statement on a\xc2\xa0systematic basis over the periods that the related \nexpenses, for which it is intended to compensate, are recognised. In the case of an income-related grant, the grant \nis\xc2\xa0deducted from the related expense.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership structureGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceOtherAnnual Financial Statements\x0cAnnual Financial Statements 2018  /  Notes to the Consolidated Annual\xc2\xa0Financial\xc2\xa0Statements\n\n175\n\nLevies and other regulatory charges\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO recognises a\xc2\xa0liability arising from levies and similar charges when it becomes legally enforceable \n(i.e.\xc2\xa0when\xc2\xa0the obligating event arises).\n\n2  Segment reporting\n\nAccounting policy for segment reporting\nThe segment reporting is in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments. The segments are reported in a\xc2\xa0manner \nconsistent with internal reporting provided to the Executive Board, which is responsible for allocating resources and \nassessing performance and has been identified as the chief operating decision-maker. All transactions between \nsegments are eliminated as intersegment revenues and expenses in Group Functions.\n\nDuring the first half of 2018, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO transferred the portfolio of small business clients with a\xc2\xa0turnover of up to \nEUR\xc2\xa01\xc2\xa0million from Retail Banking to Commercial Banking. As a\xc2\xa0consequence, the segment reporting has also changed. \nHistorical figures have been adjusted for comparison purposes. The transfer has no effect on the historical overall group \nresults or financial position of the bank.\n\nGeographical data are presented according to the management view.\n\nSegment assets, liabilities, income and results are measured based on our accounting policies. Segment assets, \nliabilities, income and results include items directly attributable to a\xc2\xa0segment, as well as those that can be allocated on \na\xc2\xa0reasonable basis. Transactions between segments are conducted at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length.\n\nInterest income is reported as net interest income because management primarily relies on net interest income as \na\xc2\xa0performance measure, not gross income and expense.\n\nThere was no revenue from transactions with a\xc2\xa0single external client or counterparty exceeding 10% of the bank\xe2\x80\x99s total \nrevenue in 2018 or 2017.\n\nRetail Banking\nRetail Banking provides banking products and services to individuals. In addition, a\xc2\xa0wide variety of banking and insurance \nproducts and services are provided through our branch network, online, via contact centres and through subsidiaries. \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO HypothekenGroep, Alfam, ICS and Moneyou are part of Retail Banking.\n\nCommercial Banking\nCommercial Banking serves business clients with a\xc2\xa0turnover of up to EUR\xc2\xa0250\xc2\xa0million, clients active in commercial \nreal\xc2\xa0estate (excluding publicly listed companies, which are served by Corporate & Institutional Banking) and small \nbusinesses. Our Asset Based Finance activities are included in Commercial Banking.\n\nPrivate Banking\nPrivate Banking provides total solutions to meet its clients\xe2\x80\x99 global wealth management needs and offers a\xc2\xa0rich array of \nproducts and services designed to address these clients\xe2\x80\x99 individual requirements. Private Banking operates under the \nbrand name of ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO MeesPierson in the Netherlands and internationally\xc2\xa0under the name of ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Private \nBanking or various local brand names such as Banque Neuflize OBC in France and Bethmann Bank in Germany.\n\nCorporate & Institutional Banking\nCorporate & Institutional Banking (CIB) serves business clients with turnover exceeding EUR\xc2\xa0250\xc2\xa0million. In Northwest \nEurope, clients with turnover exceeding EUR\xc2\xa0100\xc2\xa0million are served in eight selected sectors. CIB covers loan products \n(Structured Finance and Trade & Commodity Finance), flow products (Global Markets) and specialised products (Clearing \nand Private Equity). CIB\xe2\x80\x99s business activities are organised according to sector, geography and product.\n\nGroup Functions\nGroup Functions supports the business segments and consists of Innovation & Technology, Risk Management, Legal \nand\xc2\xa0Compliance, Finance, HR, Transformation and Communications, Group Audit, Strategy & Sustainability, and the \nCorporate Office. The majority of Group Functions\xe2\x80\x99 costs are allocated to the businesses. The results of Group Functions \ninclude those of ALM and Treasury and the securities financing activities.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadershipGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceOtherAnnual Financial Statements\x0cAnnual Financial Statements 2018  /  Notes to the Consolidated Annual\xc2\xa0Financial\xc2\xa0Statements\n\n176\n\nSegment income statement for the year 2018\n\n(in\xc2\xa0millions)\n\nNet interest income\nNet fee and commission income\nNet trading income\nShare of result in equity accounted investments\nOther operating income\nOperating income\nExpenses\nPersonnel expenses\nGeneral and administrative expenses\nDepreciation and amortisation of tangible  \n\nand intangible assets\n\nIntersegment revenues/expenses\nOperating expenses\nImpairment charges on financial instruments\nTotal expenses\nOperating profit/(loss) before taxation\nIncome tax expense\nProfit/(loss) for the period\nAttributable to:\nOwners of the company\nHolders of AT1 capital securities\nOther non-controlling interests\n\nRetail \nBanking\n\nCommercial \nBanking\n\nPrivate \nBanking\n\nCorporate &  \nInstitutional Banking\n\nGroup  \nFunctions\n\n3,122\n365\n\n28\n3\n3,517\n\n442\n568\n\n10\n1,008\n2,028\n-12\n2,016\n1,501\n375\n1,126\n\n1,126\n\n1,602\n258\n-1\n2\n38\n1,899\n\n335\n202\n\n7\n502\n1,046\n253\n1,299\n600\n153\n448\n\n448\n\n719\n509\n8\n13\n91\n1,340\n\n390\n248\n\n21\n269\n929\n3\n932\n408\n95\n312\n\n312\n\n1,166\n527\n153\n2\n268\n2,116\n\n480\n337\n\n8\n363\n1,189\n427\n1,616\n501\n75\n426\n\n387\n\n39\n\n-16\n40\n14\n-1\n183\n220\n\n794\n1,381\n\n127\n-2,143\n160\n-16\n143\n77\n64\n13\n\n-66\n79\n\n2018\n\nTotal\n\n6,593\n1,699\n173\n43\n584\n9,093\n\n2,441\n2,737\n\n173\n\n5,351\n655\n6,006\n3,086\n762\n2,325\n\n2,207\n79\n39\n\nRetail Banking\nNet interest income decreased by 3% to EUR\xc2\xa03,122\xc2\xa0million (2017: EUR\xc2\xa03,233\xc2\xa0million). If adjusted for incidentals in the \ntwo periods, the decrease is mainly attributable to the combined impact of approximately EUR\xc2\xa060\xc2\xa0million resulting from \nthe updating of\xc2\xa0the model used for non-maturing deposits (NMD) and the reallocation of net interest income from Group \nFunctions. Interest income from residential mortgages remained stable as the lower average volumes were offset by \na\xc2\xa0slight improvement in margins resulting from good pricing discipline in a\xc2\xa0highly competitive market. Interest income on \nconsumer loans decreased as a\xc2\xa0result of lower average volumes and margins.

The figure for 2017 included a\xc2\xa0book gain of \nEUR\xc2\xa0114\xc2\xa0million following the sale of the remaining equity stake in Visa Inc. \n \nPersonnel expenses decreased by EUR\xc2\xa031\xc2\xa0million to EUR\xc2\xa0442\xc2\xa0million (2017: EUR\xc2\xa0473\xc2\xa0million), mainly due to lower \nrestructuring costs in 2018 (EUR\xc2\xa05\xc2\xa0million versus EUR\xc2\xa024\xc2\xa0million in 2017) and declining FTE levels. This was partly offset \nby the new Collective Labour Agreement, which provided for a\xc2\xa02% increase in salaries and a\xc2\xa0one-off payment of \nEUR\xc2\xa01,000 per employee. The number of FTE fell by 615 to 4,445 as at 31 December 2018 as a\xc2\xa0result of digitalisation \nand cost-saving programmes, and this decrease is also reflected in the further reduction in the number of branches. \n \nGeneral and administrative expenses increased by EUR 46 million to EUR 568 million (2017: EUR 522 million), mainly \ndue to a provision of EUR 30 million for additional costs to accelerate customer due diligence (CDD) remediation \nprogrammes (see note 29 Provisions for further information) and higher regulatory levies (EUR 169 million, compared \nwith EUR 155 million in 2017).  \n \nImpairment charges amounted to a\xc2\xa0release of EUR\xc2\xa012\xc2\xa0million, compared with a\xc2\xa0release of EUR\xc2\xa0101\xc2\xa0million in 2017. \nImpairment charges in 2017 largely benefited from favourable model updates, as well as from additional IBNI releases \nof\xc2\xa0EUR\xc2\xa060\xc2\xa0million.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership structureGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceOtherAnnual Financial Statements\x0cAnnual Financial Statements 2018  /  Notes to the Consolidated Annual\xc2\xa0Financial\xc2\xa0Statements\n\n177\n\nCommercial Banking\nNet interest income decreased by EUR\xc2\xa026\xc2\xa0million to EUR\xc2\xa01,602\xc2\xa0million (2017: EUR\xc2\xa01,628\xc2\xa0million).

Excluding this release, net \ninterest income rose on the back of continued growth in client lending across all sectors and improved margins.

The figure for 2017 included the \nbenefits of more favourable revaluation results. \n \nPersonnel expenses increased by EUR\xc2\xa07\xc2\xa0million to EUR\xc2\xa0335\xc2\xa0million (2017: EUR\xc2\xa0328\xc2\xa0million). The increase was driven \nby\xc2\xa0a\xc2\xa0higher restructuring provision in 2018 of EUR\xc2\xa031\xc2\xa0million (2017: EUR\xc2\xa012\xc2\xa0million), the one-off payment to employees \nin\xc2\xa0the Collective Labour Agreement and wage inflation.

Excluding the contribution of PB \nAsia, net interest income rose by EUR\xc2\xa079\xc2\xa0million. The increase was mainly due to margin improvements and partly offset \nby the combined impact of the updating of the NMD model and the reallocation of net interest income from Group \nFunctions, which negatively impacted on net interest income by EUR\xc2\xa020\xc2\xa0million. Net interest income in 2017 was \nnegatively impacted by the Euribor provision of EUR\xc2\xa010\xc2\xa0million. \n \nNet fee and commission income decreased by EUR\xc2\xa064\xc2\xa0million to EUR\xc2\xa0509\xc2\xa0million (2017: EUR\xc2\xa0573\xc2\xa0million). Excluding the \ncontribution of PB Asia in 2017, net fee and commission decreased by EUR\xc2\xa049\xc2\xa0million. Due to the volatility in the financial \nmarkets, Private Banking clients were less active in securities transactions, while more clients opted for execution only \ninstead of managed portfolios, and the raised client threshold for advisory services resulted in lower advisory volumes. \n \nOther operating income decreased by EUR\xc2\xa0176\xc2\xa0million to EUR\xc2\xa091\xc2\xa0million (2017: EUR\xc2\xa0267\xc2\xa0million). Excluding the proceeds \nof the PB Asia divestments in 2017, other operating income rose by EUR\xc2\xa058\xc2\xa0million in 2018. This was mainly the result of \npositive incidentals of EUR\xc2\xa060\xc2\xa0million relating to sale proceeds and provision releases from divestments, specifically the \nsale of PB Luxembourg and asset management activities in France. \n \n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadershipGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceOtherAnnual Financial Statements\x0cAnnual Financial Statements 2018  /  Notes to the Consolidated Annual\xc2\xa0Financial\xc2\xa0Statements\n\n178\n\nPersonnel expenses decreased by EUR\xc2\xa082\xc2\xa0million to EUR\xc2\xa0390\xc2\xa0million (2017: EUR\xc2\xa0472\xc2\xa0million). Excluding the results of \nPB Asia in 2017, personnel expenses decreased in 2018 owing to the substantial reduction in FTE numbers, which was \npartly offset by wage inflation. The number of FTE was 445 lower than in 2017, primarily due to progress made in the \nrestructuring programmes and the divestment of PB Luxembourg. \n \nGeneral and administrative expenses amounted to EUR\xc2\xa0248\xc2\xa0million, compared with EUR\xc2\xa0280\xc2\xa0million in 2017. Excluding \nthe results of PB Asia in 2017, general and administrative expenses increased by EUR\xc2\xa06\xc2\xa0million, mainly due to higher \nregulatory levies. \n \nDepreciation and amortisation of tangible and intangible assets amounted to EUR\xc2\xa021\xc2\xa0million (2017: EUR\xc2\xa065\xc2\xa0million). \nThe\xc2\xa0figure for 2017 included a\xc2\xa0goodwill impairment of EUR\xc2\xa036\xc2\xa0million. \n \nIntersegment expenses were EUR\xc2\xa010\xc2\xa0million lower at EUR\xc2\xa0269\xc2\xa0million (2017: EUR\xc2\xa0279\xc2\xa0million) as a\xc2\xa0result of the ongoing \ncost-saving programmes in Group Functions. \n        \nImpairment charges totalled EUR\xc2\xa03\xc2\xa0million, compared with a\xc2\xa0release of EUR\xc2\xa06\xc2\xa0million in 2017, largely driven by additions \nin the Netherlands.\n\nCorporate & Institutional Banking       \nNet interest income rose by EUR\xc2\xa0191\xc2\xa0million to EUR\xc2\xa01,166\xc2\xa0million (2017: EUR\xc2\xa0975\xc2\xa0million) owing to the favourable \nimpact of new deals and on the back of increased client lending, while growth slowed throughout 2018 as a\xc2\xa0result of \nthe\xc2\xa0strategy refocus. Deposit income was also higher as margins improved modestly and compensated for the lower \nvolumes. The increase also included an amount of approximately EUR\xc2\xa040\xc2\xa0million representing the combined impact of \nthe updating of the model used for NMD and the reallocation of net interest income from Group Functions, as well as \nhigher results in both Global Markets and Clearing. \n\xc2\xa0 \nNet fee and commission income decreased by EUR\xc2\xa011\xc2\xa0million to EUR\xc2\xa0527\xc2\xa0million (2017: EUR\xc2\xa0538\xc2\xa0million).

The increase was mainly attributable to \nfavourable Equity Participations results (EUR\xc2\xa0274\xc2\xa0million versus EUR\xc2\xa0114\xc2\xa0million in 2017) and more favourable \nrevaluations in Clearing. \n\xc2\xa0 \nPersonnel expenses amounted to EUR\xc2\xa0480\xc2\xa0million (2017: EUR\xc2\xa0442\xc2\xa0million). The increase was driven by restructuring \nprovisions in 2018, mainly relating to the previously announced strategy refocus and, to a\xc2\xa0lesser extent, to wage inflation. \n\xc2\xa0 \nGeneral and administrative expenses decreased by EUR\xc2\xa086\xc2\xa0million to EUR\xc2\xa0337\xc2\xa0million (2017: EUR\xc2\xa0423\xc2\xa0million), mainly \ndue to lower provisions for project costs of SME derivatives-related issues (EUR\xc2\xa041\xc2\xa0million versus EUR\xc2\xa0139\xc2\xa0million in \n2017).

The higher impairments taken were mainly on \nexisting impaired loans and primarily in offshore markets (mainly in Natural Resources and Global Transportation & \nLogistics) and in Trade & Commodity Finance, including diamonds. \n       \nGroup Functions\nNet interest income amounted to EUR\xc2\xa016\xc2\xa0million negative (2017: EUR\xc2\xa038\xc2\xa0million negative). The figure for 2018 included \na\xc2\xa0provision release of EUR\xc2\xa035\xc2\xa0million relating to securities financing activities discontinued in 2009.

income\n\nAccounting policy for net interest income\nInterest income and expense on financial instruments is recognised in the income statement on an accrual basis using \nthe effective interest rate method, except for those financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss. \nThe effective interest rate method allocates interest, amortisation of any discount or premium or other differences, \nincluding transaction costs and qualifying fees and commissions, over the expected lives of the assets and liabilities. \nThe\xc2\xa0effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash flows to the net carrying amount \nof\xc2\xa0the asset. As a result, this method requires ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO to estimate future cash flows, in some cases based on its \nexperience of customer behaviour, considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, as well as the expected \nlives of the assets and liabilities. Interest on loans and advances measured at fair value through profit or loss is also \nincluded in net interest income and recognised using the contractual interest rate.\xc2\xa0There are no individual products that \nare material to the bank\xe2\x80\x99s results or financial position. Interest income and expenses of trading balances are included \nin\xc2\xa0net trading income. Interest paid on assets with a negative interest yield is classified as interest expense.

The main drivers were growth in corporate loans, the favourable impact of new deals (mainly \ninterest-related fees) and higher mortgage penalty fees. Interest income on residential mortgages remained stable as \naverage volumes and margins remained under control despite the increasing competition.

After identifying contracts and their performance obligations, revenue is recognised\xc2\xa0as an \namount that reflects the consideration to which the bank expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised \nservices to customers. The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation. Revenue is measured at the \nfair\xc2\xa0value of the consideration received, taking into account discounts and rebates. The amount of revenue recognised \nis\xc2\xa0discounted to the present value of consideration due, if payment extends beyond normal credit terms.\n\nRevenue is recognised when a promised service is transferred to the customer. Fees and commissions are recognised \neither:\n \xc3\x85 At a point in time: the fee is a reward for a service provided at a\xc2\xa0moment in time; or\n \xc3\x85 Over time (amortised): the fee relates to services on an ongoing basis.\n\nNet fee and commission income decreased by EUR\xc2\xa048\xc2\xa0million in 2018 compared to 2017. A third of this decrease was \nattributable to the PB Asia divestment in 2017 as the figure for that year included four months of fee income from this \nbusiness. The remaining decrease occurred primarily within Private Banking as net fee and commission income was \nhigher in 2017 due to more favourable market conditions. The decrease in 2018 was partly offset by higher fees in Retail \nBanking, and specifically the increase in the fees charged for payment packages, and to higher fees in the Clearing \nbusiness as a result of greater market volatility.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership structureGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceOtherAnnual Financial Statements\x0cAnnual Financial Statements 2018  /  Notes to the Consolidated Annual\xc2\xa0Financial\xc2\xa0Statements\n\n185\n\nFee and commission income\nFee and commission income for the years ended 31 December is specified in the following table.\n\n(in\xc2\xa0millions)\n\nFee and commission income\nFee and commission expense\nNet fee and commission income\n\n(in\xc2\xa0millions)\n\nFee and commission income from:\nSecurities and custodian services\nPayment services\nPortfolio management and trust fees\nGuarantees and commitment fees\nInsurance and investment fees\nOther service fees\nTotal fee and commission income\nTiming fee and commission income\nRecognised at a point in time\nRecognised over time\nTotal fee and commission income\n\n2018\n\n3,169\n1,470\n1,699\n\nRetail \nBanking\n\nCommercial \nBanking\n\nPrivate \nBanking\n\nCorporate & \nInstitutional \nBanking\n\nGroup \nFunctions\n\n19\n310\n45\n21\n46\n17\n457\n\n241\n216\n457\n\n1\n202\n1\n28\n1\n71\n303\n\n271\n33\n303\n\n60\n28\n475\n5\n32\n14\n613\n\n355\n259\n613\n\n1,436\n87\n\n109\n\n48\n1,680\n\n1,652\n29\n1,680\n\n1\n35\n\n80\n115\n\n115\n\n115\n\nFee and commission income rose by EUR\xc2\xa031\xc2\xa0million compared with 2017, partly thanks to the increase in fees \nin\xc2\xa0the\xc2\xa0Clearing business that resulted from greater market volatility.

The latter comprise trading financial assets \nand liabilities, interest income and expenses related to trading financial assets and liabilities, dividends received from \ntrading instruments and related funding costs. Dividend income from trading instruments is recognised when \nentitlement is established. Net trading income also includes changes in fair value arising from changes in counterparty \ncredit spreads (CVA) and changes in own credit spreads (DVA) where these impact on the value of our trading liabilities. \nThe funding valuation adjustment (FVA) incorporates the incremental cost of funding into the valuation of uncollateralised \nand partly collateralised derivatives.\n\n(in\xc2\xa0millions)\n\nInterest instruments trading1\nEquity and commodity trading1\nForeign exchange transaction results2\nTotal net trading income\n\n2018\n\n12\n20\n142\n173\n\n2017\n\n80\n61\n146\n287\n\n1  Due to a refinement of transaction results in trading income prior year amounts of interest instruments trading, equity and commodity trading and other trading have been adjusted.\n2  The foreign exchange transaction results have been refined, therefore foreign exchange transaction results for balances not being \xe2\x80\x98fair value to profit or loss\xe2\x80\x99 have been reported as part \n\nof\xc2\xa0the other operating income.

Income tax expense consists of current and deferred \ntax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement and in the statement of other comprehensive income in the \nperiod in which profits arise. Withholding taxes are included in income tax if these taxes are payable by a subsidiary, \nassociate or joint arrangement on distributions to ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO.\xc2\xa0Income tax recoverable on tax-allowable losses is \nrecognised as a current tax asset only to the extent that it is regarded as recoverable by offsetting against taxable \nprofits\xc2\xa0arising in the current or prior period. Current tax is measured using tax rates enacted at the balance sheet date.\n\nDeferred tax is recognised for qualifying temporary differences. Temporary differences represent the difference between \nthe carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. \nThe amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the\xc2\xa0carrying amount \nof assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted at the balance sheet date. A deferred tax asset is\xc2\xa0recognised only to the \nextent that it is probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.\n\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only when there is both a legal right to offset and an intention to settle  \non a net basis.\n\n(in\xc2\xa0millions)\n\nRecognised in income statement:\nCurrent tax expenses for the current period\nAdjustments recognised in the period for current tax of prior periods\nPreviously unrecognised tax losses, tax credits and temporary differences increasing  \n\n(reducing) current tax expenses\n\nTotal current tax expense\nDeferred tax arising from the current period\nImpact of changes in tax rates on deferred taxes\nDeferred tax arising from the write-down or reversal of a write-down of a deferred tax asset\nDeferred tax prior period\nPreviously unrecognised tax losses, tax credits and temporary differences  \n\nreducing deferred tax expense\n\nTax expense (income) relating to changes in accounting policies and errors included in profit and loss\nTotal deferred tax expense\nTotal income tax expense\n\n2018\n\n779\n-61\n\n1\n718\n-16\n11\n19\n42\n\n-8\n-4\n44\n762\n\n2017\n\n979\n-3\n\n4\n981\n-52\n34\n25\n\n-9\n\n-1\n979\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadershipGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceOtherAnnual Financial Statements\x0cAnnual Financial Statements 2018  /  Notes to the Consolidated Annual\xc2\xa0Financial\xc2\xa0Statements\n\n190\n\nReconciliation of the total tax charge\nThe effective rate based on the Consolidated income statement differs from the theoretical rate that would arise using \nthe statutory tax rate of the Netherlands.

Although the total non-deductible \nexpenses in respect of interest, bank levy and expenses that are partly deductible increased, this was exceeded by the \nnon-taxable gains and income. The changes to tax rates in various countries resulted in the carrying value of the deferred \ntax assets being reduced. The adjustments of prior years reflect the effects of changes of facts or other factors in \ncomparison of previous periods.       \n\nTax assets and liabilities\nThe most significant temporary differences arise from the revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities, including \nderivative contracts, allowances for loan impairment and investments.

The accounting treatment of the hedged item \nand\xc2\xa0the\xc2\xa0hedging instrument depends on whether the hedge relationship qualifies for hedge accounting.\n\nQualifying hedges may be designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments.  \nA\xc2\xa0non-derivative financial asset or liability may be designated as a hedging instrument for hedge accounting purposes \nonly if it hedges the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nThe hedged item can be an asset, liability, highly probable forecasted transaction or net investment in a foreign operation \nthat (a) exposes the entity to the risk of changes in fair value or future cash flows, and (b) is designated as being hedged. \nThe risks being hedged (the hedged risks) are typically changes in interest rates or foreign currency rates. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO \nmay also enter into credit risk derivatives (sometimes referred to as credit default swaps) for managing portfolio credit \nrisk. However, these are not generally included in hedge accounting relationships. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO did not use credit \nderivatives in hedge accounting relationships in 2017 or 2018.\n\nBoth at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO assesses whether the derivatives\xc2\xa0designated \nin\xc2\xa0each hedging relationship are expected to be and have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value \nor\xc2\xa0cash flows of the hedged item (prospectively and retrospectively), using a regression analysis.\nUnder the Group\xe2\x80\x99s policy, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO applies\xc2\xa0the following criteria to assess whether\xc2\xa0the hedging relationship \nis\xc2\xa0effective:\n \xc3\x85 A regression co-efficient (R squared), which measures the correlation between the variables in the regression; and\n \xc3\x85 A slope of the regression line is within a 0.80-1.25 range.\n\nHedge ineffectiveness and gains and losses on components of a derivative that are excluded from the assessment \nof\xc2\xa0hedge effectiveness are recorded directly in result from financial transactions as part of other operating income. \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO discontinues hedge accounting when the hedge relationship has ceased to be effective or is no longer \nexpected to be effective, or when the derivative or hedged item is sold or otherwise terminated.\n\nAdoption of EU carved-out version IAS 39\nMicro fair value hedges are hedging of separate hedged items, which can be assets or liabilities. For micro fair value \nhedging, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO uses the carved-out version of IAS 39, as adopted by the European Union, which means that \nnegative credit spreads are excluded in the hedge relationship for micro fair value hedging.\n\nMacro fair value hedging implies that a group of financial assets is reviewed in combination and jointly designated as the \nhedged item. However, the portfolio may, for risk management purposes, include assets and liabilities. In this context, \nthe starting difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the hedged item at the designation of the \nhedging relationship is amortised over the remaining life of the hedged item. For macro fair value hedging, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO \nuses the carved-out version of IAS 39, as adopted by the European Union, which removes some of the limitations on fair \nvalue hedges and the strict requirements on the effectiveness of those hedges. In this context, the impact of changes \nin\xc2\xa0the estimates of the repricing dates is considered ineffective only if it leads to over-hedging.\n\nFair value hedges\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO applies fair value hedge accounting on individual hedged items (micro fair value hedging), as well as on \na\xc2\xa0portfolio of hedged items (macro fair value hedging).\n\nWhere a derivative financial instrument hedges the exposure to changes in the fair value of the hedged item, the hedged \nitem is adjusted in relation to the risk being hedged. Gains or losses on re-measurement of both the hedging instrument \nand the hedged item are recognised in the income statement within result from financial transactions as part of other \noperating income. Hedge effectiveness for fair value hedges is measured as the amount by which the changes in the fair \nvalue of the hedging instrument are different from the changes in the fair value of the hedged item.

To ensure an effective matching of hedged items and hedging \ninstruments, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO applies a dynamic strategy in which hedged items are de-designated and re-designated \non\xc2\xa0a\xc2\xa0monthly basis.\xc2\xa0The hedge accounting relationship is reviewed and re-designated on a monthly basis.\n\nAs a result of the macro fair value hedge, changes in the hedged item\xe2\x80\x99s fair value due to changes in the appropriate \nbenchmark interest rate are booked to the income statement and are offset by changes in the fair value of the hedging \nderivative financial instrument. This therefore reduces the profit or loss volatility that would otherwise arise from \nchanges in the fair value of the interest rate swaps alone.\n\nHedged mortgages are fixed-rate mortgages with the following features:\n \xc3\x85 denominated in local currency (euro);\n \xc3\x85 fixed term to maturity or repricing;\n \xc3\x85 pre-payable amortising or fixed principal amounts;\n \xc3\x85 fixed interest payment dates;\n \xc3\x85 no interest rate options;\n \xc3\x85 accounted for on an amortised cost basis.\n\nAt each designation, the mortgage cash flows are allocated to monthly time buckets, based on the expected maturity \ndates. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO models the maturity dates of mortgages, taking into account the modelled prepayments applied to \nthe contractual cash flows and the maturity dates of the mortgage portfolio. If the swap notional exceeds the expected \nmortgage notional in any given month, taking into account the uncertainty of the expected mortgage notional by applying \na haircut, mortgages that mature in adjacent buckets are designated to the swaps.\n\nChanges in the fair value of the mortgages that are attributable to the hedged interest rate risk are recorded under \nfair\xc2\xa0value adjustments from hedge accounting in order to adjust the carrying amount of the mortgages. The recognised \nfair value changes in the mortgages reduce the profit or loss volatility that would otherwise arise from changes in the fair \nvalue of the interest rate swaps.\n\nThe difference between the fair value attributable to the hedged interest rate risk and the carrying value of the hedged \nmortgages at de-designation of the hedge relationship is amortised over the remaining life of the hedged item.\n\nIn addition to the above sources of ineffectiveness for micro fair value hedges, the sources of ineffectiveness specifically \nfor macro hedges are:\n \xc3\x85 The difference between the expected and actual volume of prepayments for the mortgage portfolio to the extent \n\nthe\xc2\xa0difference would lead to over-hedging; and\n\n \xc3\x85 The difference in payment frequency between the fixed leg of the hedging instrument and the payment frequency \n\nof\xc2\xa0the hedged item (mortgages).\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership structureGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceOtherAnnual Financial Statements\x0cAnnual Financial Statements 2018  /  Notes to the Consolidated Annual\xc2\xa0Financial\xc2\xa0Statements\n\n201\n\nCash flow hedges\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO applies macro cash flow hedge accounting by which it designates interest rate swaps as hedging \ninstruments and future cash flows on non-trading assets and liabilities as hedged items. The hedge accounting \nrelationship is reviewed on a monthly basis and the hedging instruments and hedged items are de-designated  \nor\xc2\xa0re-designated, if necessary, to maintain an effective hedge accounting relationship.\n\nWhen a derivative financial instrument hedges the exposure to variability in the cash flows from a hedged item, \nthe\xc2\xa0effective part of any gain or loss on re-measurement of the hedging instrument is recognised directly in other \ncomprehensive income. Hedge effectiveness for cash flow hedges is measured as the amount by which the changes \nin\xc2\xa0the fair value of the derivative are in excess of changes in the fair value of the expected cash flow in the cash flow \nhedge. Any ineffective part of the cash flow hedge is recognised in other operating income immediately. When a cash \nflow hedging instrument or hedge relationship is terminated but the hedged transaction is still expected to occur, \nthe\xc2\xa0cumulative gains or losses are recognised in other comprehensive income.\n\nThe cumulative gains or losses recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement \nwhen the hedged transaction affects net profit or loss and is included in the same line item as the hedged transaction. \nIn\xc2\xa0the exceptional case that the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gains or losses \nrecognised in other comprehensive income are recognised in the income statement immediately.\n\nThe main sources of hedge ineffectiveness for cash flow hedges are:\n \xc3\x85 The effect of the counterparty and the Group\xe2\x80\x99s own credit risk on the fair value of the interest rate swap that\xc2\xa0is \n\nnot\xc2\xa0reflected in the fair value of the hedged item, which is only attributable to the change in the interest rate; and\n\n \xc3\x85 Potential differences in maturities of the interest rate swap and the loans or notes.\n\nThere are no other sources of ineffectiveness in these hedge relationships. \n\nThe hedged items in the macro cash flow hedge are future cash flows, which are derived from the projected balance \nsheet. This projected balance sheet takes the contractual terms and conditions of financial assets and liabilities and \ncombines these with estimated prepayments, volume growth rates and interest scenarios.\n\nWithin the projected balance sheet, assets and liabilities are grouped on the basis of the specific interest rate index \non\xc2\xa0which they reprice (e.g. one month, three months, six months, one year). For each repricing index, all assets and \nliabilities are allocated to monthly clusters in which they reprice up until their maturity.\n\nThe notional amounts of pay- or receive-floating swaps are designated to repricing all or a portion of current and \nforecasted assets and liabilities, respectively, in the clusters described above. These swap transactions are designated \nfor hedge accounting purposes as a hedge of a gross position of a cluster of projected cash flows. In addition, the swap \nwill only hedge the applicable floating swap rate portion of the interest repricing and reinvestment risk of the cluster. \nThe\xc2\xa0availability of projected cash flows in the clusters is not constant over time and is therefore evaluated on a monthly \nbasis. Changes in cash flow projections may lead to a revision of the designation. Back-testing is performed on the \ninterest rate risk sensitivity models. Historical data is used to review the assumptions applied.\n\nForecasted transactions\nWhen the hedging instrument effectively hedges a forecasted transaction or firm commitment, the changes in fair value \nof the hedging instrument are recognised in other comprehensive income. Amounts deferred in other comprehensive \nincome are transferred to the income statement and classified as profit or loss in the periods during which the hedged \nfirm commitment or forecasted transaction affects the income statement. If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for \nhedge accounting or is otherwise discontinued while the hedged forecasted transactions or firm commitments are still \nexpected to occur, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively.\n\nIn 2018 and 2017, there were no forecasted transactions for which hedge accounting\xc2\xa0had been applied ineffectively.\n\nHedging of net investments in foreign operations\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO may enter into foreign currency derivatives and currency borrowings to hedge various net investments \nin\xc2\xa0foreign operations. For such hedges, currency translation differences arising on translation of the currency of these \ninstruments to euros are recognised directly in the currency translation reserve in other comprehensive income, insofar \nas they are effective. The cumulative gains or losses recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the \nincome statement on the disposal of the foreign operation.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadershipGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceOtherAnnual Financial Statements\x0cAnnual Financial Statements 2018  /  Notes to the Consolidated Annual\xc2\xa0Financial\xc2\xa0Statements\n\n202\n\nIn previous years (before 2017), ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO hedged its currency exposure to certain investments in foreign operations \nby hedging its net investment in these foreign operations with forward contracts. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO currently still holds some \ncurrency translation reserve for these respective positions, but no longer applies net investment hedge accounting.\n\nHedges not qualifying for hedge accounting\nThe fair value changes of derivative transactions used to hedge against economic risk exposures that do not qualify \nfor\xc2\xa0hedge accounting, or for which it is not cost-beneficial to apply hedge accounting, are recognised directly in profit \nor\xc2\xa0loss.\n\nEffect on financial position and performance \xe2\x80\x93 hedging instruments\n\n(in\xc2\xa0millions)\n\n31 December 2018\nCash flow hedges \xe2\x80\x93 macro\nInterest rate\nFair value hedges \xe2\x80\x93 macro\nInterest rate\nFair value hedges \xe2\x80\x93 micro\nInterest rate\nEconomic hedges\nTotal economic hedges\n31 December 2017\nCash flow hedges \xe2\x80\x93 macro\nInterest rate\nFair value hedges \xe2\x80\x93 macro\nInterest rate\nFair value hedges \xe2\x80\x93 micro\nInterest rate\nEconomic hedges\nTotal economic hedges\n\nNotional \namount\n\nCarrying amount\nLiabilities\n\nAssets\n\nLine item in the \nstatement of \nfinancial position\n\nChanges in fair value \nused for calculation \nhedge ineffectiveness \nfor the year\n\n19,613\n\n18,136\n\n100,496\n\n32,190\n\n29,126\n\n29,848\n\n92,141\n\n33,278\n\n1\n\n942\n\n408\n\n133\n\n942\n\n584\n\nDerivatives\n\n35\n\nDerivatives\n\n1,397\n\nDerivatives\n\n724\n\nDerivatives\n\nDerivatives\n\n458\n\nDerivatives\n\n1,213\n\nDerivatives\n\n784\n\nDerivatives\n\n-180\n\n100\n\n204\n\nn/a\n\n-253\n\n879\n\n-58\n\nn/a\n\nThe notional amount of the cash flow hedges decreased by EUR\xc2\xa09.5\xc2\xa0billion to EUR\xc2\xa019.6\xc2\xa0billion at 31 December 2018 \n(31\xc2\xa0December 2017: EUR\xc2\xa029.1\xc2\xa0billion).

Securities financing consists of securities borrowing and lending and \nsale and repurchase transactions. Securities borrowing and securities lending transactions are generally entered into on \na collateralised basis, with securities usually advanced or received as collateral. The transfer of the securities themselves \nis not reflected in the statement of financial position unless the risks and rewards of ownership are also transferred. If \ncash is advanced or received, securities borrowing and lending activities are recorded at the amount of cash advanced \n(included in loans and advances) or received (due to banks or customers). The market value of the securities borrowed \nor\xc2\xa0lent is monitored on a daily basis, and the collateral levels are adjusted in accordance with the underlying transactions. \nFees and interest received or paid are recognised on an effective interest rate basis and recorded as interest income or \ninterest expense.\n\nSale and repurchase transactions involve purchases (or sales) of investments with agreements to resell (or repurchase) \nsubstantially identical investments at a certain date in the future at a fixed price. Investments purchased subject to \ncommitments to resell them at future dates are not recognised. The amounts paid are recognised in loans and advances \nto either banks or customers and are shown as collateralised by the underlying security.\n\nInvestments sold under repurchase agreements continue to be recognised in the statement of financial position. \nProceeds from the sale of the investments are reported as liabilities to either banks or customers. The difference \nbetween the sale and repurchase price is recognised over the period of the transaction and recorded as interest income \nor interest expense, using the effective interest rate method. If borrowed securities are sold to third parties, the proceeds \nfrom the sale and a liability for the obligation to return the collateral are recorded at fair value.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadershipGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceOtherAnnual Financial Statements\x0cAnnual Financial Statements 2018  /  Notes to the Consolidated Annual\xc2\xa0Financial\xc2\xa0Statements\n\n208\n\n(in\xc2\xa0millions)\n\nAssets\nReverse repurchase agreements\nSecurities borrowing transactions\nTotal\nLiabilities\nRepurchase agreements\nSecurities lending transactions\nTotal\n\nBanks\n\n2,412\n2,205\n4,617\n\n694\n549\n1,243\n\n31 December 2018\nCustomers\n\nBanks1\n\n31 December 2017\nCustomers1\n\n5,119\n2,639\n7,758\n\n4,725\n1,439\n6,164\n\n1,324\n2,574\n3,899\n\n913\n773\n1,686\n\n10,181\n1,606\n11,787\n\n8,404\n1,321\n9,726\n\n1  ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO classified all unsettled securities transactions as other assets and other liabilities, previously these were included in securities financing. Comparative figures have been adjusted. \n\nSecurities financing transactions include balances relating to reverse repurchase activities, repurchase activities and \ncash\xc2\xa0collateral on securities borrowed and lent. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO controls the credit risk associated with these activities by \nmonitoring counterparty credit exposure and collateral values on a daily basis and, when necessary, requiring additional \ncollateral to be deposited with or returned to ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO.\xc2\xa0\n\nThe movements of securities financing assets and liabilities with banks and customers were a result of the cyclicality \nof\xc2\xa0the business since clients build up their positions around the dividend season, reaching a high point primarily in the \nsecond and third quarters, and a low point around the year-end. The pattern in 2018 was similar to that in previous years. \nThe decline at year-end was more significant compared to 2017 due to\xc2\xa0a decrease in repurchase agreements and reverse \nrepurchase agreements with several large clients.                                              \n\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO has reclassified all unsettled securities transactions as other assets and other liabilities. These were \npreviously included in securities financing. The comparative figures have been adjusted accordingly.\n\nItems of securities financing transactions which ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO can repledge or resell are included in note 33 Transferred, \npledged, encumbered and restricted assets.\n\n18  Fair value of financial instruments carried\xc2\xa0at\xc2\xa0fair\xc2\xa0value\n\nAccounting policy for fair value of financial instruments\nThe fair value is defined as the price that would be received when selling an asset or paid when transferring a liability \nin\xc2\xa0an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\n\nFor financial instruments that are actively traded and for which quoted market prices or market parameters are readily \navailable, the fair value is determined in a highly objective manner. However, when observable market prices and \nparameters do not exist, management judgement is necessary to estimate fair value.\n\nFor financial instruments where no active liquid market exists, or quoted prices are unobtainable, recent market \ntransactions are used or the fair value is estimated using a variety of valuation techniques \xe2\x80\x93 including reference to similar \ninstruments for which market prices do exist, or to valuation models such as discounted cash flow calculation or option \npricing models (e.g. Black Scholes).\n\nWhen portfolios of financial assets and liabilities are measured on the basis of the net exposure to the credit risk of a \nparticular counterparty, any existing arrangements that mitigate the credit risk exposure (e.g. master netting agreements \nwith the counterparty) are taken into account.\n\nUnobservable inputs are estimated using a combination of management judgement, historical data, market practice and \nbenchmarking to other relevant observable market data. The difference between the transaction price and the internal \nvaluation at inception, calculated using a model, is reserved and amortised to profit or loss at appropriate points over the \nlife of the instrument, typically taking account of the ability to obtain reliable external data, the passage of time and the \nuse of offsetting transactions. Where inputs to the valuation of a new transaction cannot be reliably determined, the \ntransaction is initially recognised at its transaction price. Subsequent changes in fair value as calculated by the valuation \nmodel are reported as profit or loss or in equity.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership structureGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceOtherAnnual Financial Statements\x0cAnnual Financial Statements 2018  /  Notes to the Consolidated Annual\xc2\xa0Financial\xc2\xa0Statements\n\n209\n\nIn order to determine a reliable fair value, where appropriate, management applies valuation adjustments to the pricing \ninformation derived from the above sources. These adjustments reflect management\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of factors that \nmarket participants would consider in setting a price, to the extent that these factors have not already been included in \nthe information from the above sources. The main valuation adjustments required to arrive at a fair value are as follows:\n \xc3\x85 Credit and debit valuation adjustments. In addition to credit valuation for loans measured at fair value through profit or \nloss, credit valuation adjustments and debit valuation adjustments are incorporated into derivative valuations to reflect \nthe impact on fair value of counterparty credit risk and how counterparties consider ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s creditworthiness \nrespectively;\n\n \xc3\x85 Funding valuation adjustment. The funding valuation adjustment incorporates the incremental cost of funding into \n\nthe\xc2\xa0valuation of uncollateralised and partially collateralised derivatives;\n\n \xc3\x85 Own credit adjustment. An own credit risk adjustment is applied to financial liabilities where it is believed that \n\ncounterparties will consider ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s creditworthiness when pricing such instruments;\n\n \xc3\x85 Model valuation adjustments for any known limitations. Management assesses the appropriateness of any model \nused on an ongoing basis. To the extent that the price provided by internal models does not represent the fair value \nof\xc2\xa0the instrument, for instance in highly stressed market conditions, management makes adjustments to the model \nvaluation to calibrate to other available pricing sources.\n\nWe believe our estimates of the fair value are adequate. However, the use of different models or assumptions could \nresult in changes to our reported results.\n\nInternal controls over fair value\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO has designated controls and processes for determining the fair value of financial instruments. A process \nhas\xc2\xa0been designed to ensure there are formalised review protocols for independent review and validation of fair values \nseparate from those businesses entering into the transactions. This includes specific controls to ensure consistent \npricing policies and procedures, incorporating disciplined price verification for both market and counterparty risk trades.\n\nThe business entering into the transaction is responsible for the initial determination and recording of the fair value of \nthe transaction. There are daily controls of the profit or loss recorded by trading and treasury front-office staff.\n\nA key element of the control environment, segregated from the recording of the transaction\xe2\x80\x99s valuation, is the \nindependent price-verification process. Valuations are first calculated by the business. Such valuations may be current \nbid\xc2\xa0or offer prices in an active market, or may be derived using a model and variable model inputs. These valuations \nare\xc2\xa0reviewed and, if necessary, amended by the independent price-verification process. This process involves a team, \nindependent of those trading the financial instruments, performing a review of valuations in the light of available pricing \nevidence. Independent price verification is frequently performed by matching the business valuations with independent \ndata sources. For liquid instruments. the process is performed daily. The minimum frequency of review is monthly, both \nfor trading positions and non-trading positions. The independent price-verification control includes formalised reporting \nand escalation to management of any valuation differences in breach of defined thresholds. When models are used to \nvalue products, those models are subject to a model review process. This process requires different levels of model \ndocumentation, testing and review, depending on the complexity of the model and the size of our exposure to the \nmodel.\n\nValuation techniques\nA number of methodologies are used to determine the fair value of financial instruments for which observable prices in \nactive markets for identical instruments are not available. Values between and beyond available data points are obtained \nby interpolation and/or extrapolation. When using valuation techniques, the fair value can be significantly impacted by the \nchoice of valuation model and underlying assumptions made concerning factors such as the amount and timing of cash \nflows, discount rates and credit risk.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadershipGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceOtherAnnual Financial Statements\x0cAnnual Financial Statements 2018  /  Notes to the Consolidated Annual\xc2\xa0Financial\xc2\xa0Statements\n\n210\n\nInterest rate derivatives\nThis category includes interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, options and forward rate agreements. These products \nare valued by estimating future cash flows and discounting those cash flows using appropriate interest rate curves. The \nexception is interest option contracts, which are valued using market standard option pricing models. The inputs for the \ndiscounting cash flow models are principally observable benchmark interest rates in active markets such as the interbank \nrates and quoted interest rates in the swap, bond and futures markets. The inputs for credit spreads \xe2\x80\x93 where available \xe2\x80\x93 \nare derived from prices of credit default swaps or other credit-based instruments, such as debt securities. In other \ncases, credit spreads are obtained from pricing services. The additional inputs for the option pricing models are price \nvolatilities and correlations, which are obtained from broker quotations or pricing services or derived from option prices. \nBecause of the observability of the inputs used in the valuation models, the majority of the interest rate derivative \ncontracts are classified as level 2. If adjustments to interest rate curves, credit spreads, correlations or volatilities are \nbased on significant unobservable inputs, the contracts are classified as level 3. Exchange traded options and futures \nare\xc2\xa0valued using quoted market prices and are hence classified as level 1.\n\nForeign exchange contracts\nForeign exchange contracts include foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign exchange options and foreign exchange \nswaps. The majority of the foreign exchange contracts at ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO are traded as over-the-counter derivatives. These \ninstruments are valued using foreign currency exchange rates. There are observable markets both for spot and forward \ncontracts and for futures in the world\xe2\x80\x99s major currencies. Therefore the over-the-counter foreign exchange contracts are \nclassified as level 2.\n\nGovernment debt securities\nGovernment debt securities consist of government bonds and bills with fixed or floating rate interest payments issued \nby sovereign governments. These instruments are generally traded in active markets and prices can be derived directly \nfrom those markets. Therefore the instruments are classified as level 1. Highly liquid bonds are valued using exchange-\ntraded prices. Less liquid bonds are valued using observable market prices, which are sourced from broker quotes,   \ninter-dealer prices or other reliable pricing services. For a minority of the government debt securities, active market prices \nare not available. In these cases ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO uses discounted cash flow valuation techniques that incorporate observable \nmarket data for similar government instruments. The main inputs are interest rate curves, liquidity spreads and credit \nspreads. The instruments for which this method applies are classified as level 2. If adjustments to any of the main inputs \nare made based on significant unobservable inputs, the instrument is classified as level 3.\n\nCorporate debt securities \nCorporate debt securities primarily consist of corporate bonds and other debt securities issued by corporate entities. \nMost of these instruments are standard fixed or floating rate securities. Corporate debt securities are generally valued \nusing observable market prices, which are sourced from broker quotes, inter-dealer prices or other reliable pricing \nservices. These instruments are classified as level 1. If observable market prices are not available, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO uses \ndiscounted cash flow valuation techniques, based on inputs derived from comparable instruments and credit default \nswap data of the issuer, to estimate credit spreads. These instruments are classified as level 2.\n\nEquity instruments\nEquity instruments that are actively traded on public stock exchanges are valued using the readily available quoted prices \nand are therefore classified as level 1. Investments in private equity funds are initially recognised at their transaction \nprice and re-measured to the extent reliable information is available on a case-by-case basis and are classified as level 3.\n\nUnit-linked investments\nUnit-linked investments allow life insurance policyholders to invest indirectly, through a life insurance contract, in a pool \nof assets. The policyholders are exposed to all the risks and rewards associated with the underlying asset pool. \nThe\xc2\xa0amounts due to policyholders equal the fair value of the underlying asset pool and are represented by the financial \nliability. The fair values of life insurance contract liabilities are determined by reference to the fair value of the underlying \nassets. Actively traded unit-linked investments are valued using publicly and daily quoted prices and hence classified as \nlevel 1. Unit-linked investments for which there are no observable market prices are classified as level 2. Their value is \ndetermined by adjusting quoted prices for credit and/ or liquidity risk.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership structureGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceOtherAnnual Financial Statements\x0cAnnual Financial Statements 2018  /  Notes to the Consolidated Annual\xc2\xa0Financial\xc2\xa0Statements\n\n211\n\nLoans and advances at fair value through profit or loss\nLoans and advances at fair value through profit or loss primarily consist of contracts with corporate clients of which the \ncontractual cash flows do not meet the SPPI requirements. The return on these contracts with embedded derivatives \nis\xc2\xa0based on the price of underlying commodity contracts or loans with a floating interest rate. Discounted cash flow \nmodels are used to value these contracts. The main inputs are interest rate curves, quoted commodity prices, liquidity \nspreads and credit spreads. The instruments are classified as level 2. If adjustments to interest rate curves, liquidity \nspreads and credit spreads are based on significant unobservable inputs, the instruments are classified as level 3.\n\nIssued debt\nIssued debt securities are valued using discounted cash flow models, based on current interest rate curves that \nincorporate observable inputs. These instruments are classified as level 2. When there are no, or only limited, publicly \nquoted prices available for these instruments and unobservable inputs have a significant effect on the fair value \ncalculation, these instruments are classified as level 3.\n\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO refines and modifies its valuation techniques as markets and products develop and as the pricing for \nindividual products becomes more or less readily available. While ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO believes its valuation techniques are \nappropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions could \nresult in different estimates of the fair value at the reporting date.\n\nFair value hierarchy\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO analyses financial instruments held at fair value in the three categories described below.\n\nLevel 1 financial instruments are those that are valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical \nfinancial instruments.\n\nLevel 2 financial instruments are those valued using techniques based primarily on observable market data. Instruments \nin this category are valued using quoted prices for similar instruments or identical instruments in markets that are not \nconsidered to be active, or using valuation techniques where all the inputs that have a significant effect on the valuation \nare directly or indirectly based on observable market data.\n\nLevel 3 financial instruments are those valued using a valuation technique where at least one input with a significant \neffect on the instrument\xe2\x80\x99s valuation is not based on observable market data. The effect of fair value adjustments on \nthe\xc2\xa0instrument\xe2\x80\x99s valuation is included in the assessment.\n\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during \nwhich the change occurred.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadershipGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceOtherAnnual Financial Statements\x0cAnnual Financial Statements 2018  /  Notes to the Consolidated Annual\xc2\xa0Financial\xc2\xa0Statements\n\n212\n\nThe following table presents the valuation methods used in determining the fair values of financial instruments carried \nat\xc2\xa0fair value.\n\nQuoted \nmarket \nprices \nin active \nmarkets\n\nValuation \ntechniques \n- observ-\nable inputs\n\n31 December 2018\nValuation \ntechniques \n- significant \nunobserv-\nable inputs\n\nTotal \nfair \nvalue\n\nQuoted  \nmarket prices \nin active \nmarkets\n\nValuation \ntechniques \n- observ-\nable inputs\n\nValuation \ntechniques \n- significant \nunobserv-\nable inputs\n\n31 December 2017\n\n(in\xc2\xa0millions)\n\nAssets\nGovernment debt securities\nCorporate debt securities\nEquity securities\nOther financial assets held for trading\nFinancial assets held for trading\nInterest rate derivatives\nForeign exchange contracts\nOther derivatives\nDerivatives\nEquity instruments\nOther\nFinancial investments at fair value \nthrough profit or loss\nGovernment debt securities\nCorporate debt securities\nEquity instruments\nOther debt securities\nFinancial assets held at fair value \nthrough other comprehensive income\nGovernment debt securities\nCorporate debt securities\nEquity instruments\nOther debt securities\nFinancial assets available-for-sale\nUnit-linked investments1\nLoans and advances at fair value through \n\nprofit or loss\n\nTotal financial assets\nLiabilities\nShort positions in government debt securities\nCorporate debt securities\nEquity securities\nOther financial liabilities held for trading\nFinancial liabilities held for trading\nInterest rate derivatives\nForeign exchange contracts\nOther derivatives\nDerivatives\nIssued debt\nUnit-linked for policyholders\nTotal financial liabilities\n\n272\n173\n19\n\n465\n1\n\n157\n158\n254\n6\n\n260\n34,994\n2,405\n\n3,174\n\n40,573\n\n41,456\n\n53\n63\n4\n\n120\n4\n\n17\n20\n\n29\n\n1\n31\n4,439\n751\n746\n5,936\n186\n\n186\n\n129\n\n20\n\n150\n\n787\n7,090\n\n16\n\n117\n133\n4,920\n1,673\n545\n7,138\n889\n\nTotal \nfair \nvalue\n\n1,071\n401\n111\n16\n1,600\n6,963\n1,946\n915\n9,825\n673\n7\n\n610\n\n679\n\n15\n\n16\n31\n6,847\n1,929\n904\n9,681\n\n89\n17\n\n106\n610\n\n1,071\n386\n111\n\n1,569\n27\n\n11\n38\n63\n7\n\n70\n\n273\n202\n19\n1\n495\n4,519\n769\n903\n6,191\n998\n6\n\n1,004\n35,413\n2,573\n\n3,195\n\n79\n18\n\n97\n557\n\n557\n419\n39\n\n458 41,180\n\n32,938\n3,210\n189\n2,551\n38,888\n1,813\n\n702\n66\n\n769\n914\n\n427\n43\n160\n\n33,364\n3,955\n415\n2,551\n629 40,285\n2,728\n\n787\n1,112 49,658\n\n42,378\n\n11,394\n\n1,344 55,117\n\n53\n78\n4\n117\n253\n4,924\n1,673\n561\n7,159\n1,045\n\n156\n\n495\n345\n65\n\n905\n23\n\n149\n172\n\n1,814\n2,890\n\n10\n\n167\n177\n5,770\n1,477\n949\n8,195\n1,014\n914\n10,300\n\n495\n356\n65\n167\n1,082\n5,793\n1,477\n1,098\n8,367\n1,182\n2,728\n168 13,359\n\n168\n\n1 \n\nIn 2017 these instruments were classified as held for sale and therefore included in note 24 of the Annual Financial Statements 2017, Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale.\n\n140\n\n8,161\n\n156\n\n8,457\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership structureGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceOtherAnnual Financial Statements\x0cAnnual Financial Statements 2018  /  Notes to the Consolidated Annual\xc2\xa0Financial\xc2\xa0Statements\n\n213\n\nTransfers between levels 1 and 2\nThere were no material transfers between levels 1 and 2.\n\nTransfers from levels 1 and 2 to 3\nThere were no material transfers between levels 1 and 2 into level 3.\n\nOther transfers\nIn 2018 there was a transfer of EUR\xc2\xa0120\xc2\xa0million of equity instruments\xc2\xa0from level 3 to level 2.

This bond is valued using a discounted cash flow \nmodel. The main inputs are the interest rate curve, liquidity spread and credit spread. The valuation spread is determined \nusing an internal model. The sensitivity analysis is performed using a range of reasonable valuation spreads.\n\nOther\nPreferred shares are shares for which the dividend is fixed for a period of ten years, after which the dividend is \nredetermined, and the shares can also be redeemed. The position is valued using a discounted cash flow model \nfor\xc2\xa0which the relevant inputs are the interest curve, liquidity spread and credit spread. The liquidity spread and credit \nspread\xc2\xa0are unobservable inputs and are derived from similar securities. The sensitivity of the preferred shares is \ndetermined by using a range of reasonable spreads and by considering the call option that is held by the issuer.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadershipGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceOtherAnnual Financial Statements\x0cAnnual Financial Statements 2018  /  Notes to the Consolidated Annual\xc2\xa0Financial\xc2\xa0Statements\n\n214\n\nEquity shares \xe2\x80\x93 preferred shares\nEquities measured at fair value through profit and loss and classified as level 3 mainly comprise private equity \ninvestments.\n\nPrivate equity shares are measured at fair value, with two calculation techniques being applied:\n \xc3\x85 Using comparable pricing in accordance with the European Private Equity and Venture Capitalist Association (EVCA) \n\nguidelines. This valuation technique is based on earnings multiples of comparable listed and unlisted companies. \nThe\xc2\xa0fair value calculation of an investment is strongly linked with movements on the public equity markets;\n\n \xc3\x85 Net Asset Value (NAV) for fund investments and asset-backed investments. This is determined by using audited \n\nand unaudited company financial statements and any other information available, publicly or otherwise. As a \nconsequence, the net asset value calculation of an investment is strongly linked to movements in the quarterly \nperformance of the company and can be used as an indicator of fair value. Net Asset Value is used as an indicator \nof\xc2\xa0fair value only after a materiality assessment has been made.\n\nNew investments are initially valued at fair value and subsequently at cost for the first year of investment. Thereafter, \nthe\xc2\xa0fair value technique, either EVCA technique or NAV calculation, will be applied for direct investments.\n\nThe sensitivity for using comparable pricing is determined by stressing the earnings multiples in a positive and negative \nmarket scenario, whereas sensitivity testing for the NAV calculation based upon the quarterly performance cannot be \napplied.\n\nDerivatives\nSecuritisation swaps linked to the RMBS transactions are valued using a discounted cash flow model, for which the \nbehaviour of the underlying mortgage portfolio is also relevant. The inputs used to determine fair value are the interest \nrate curve and prepayment rate. The latter is the significant unobservable input that classifies these instruments as level 3.\n\nThe sensitivity analysis is performed by stressing the prepayment rate. Interest rate swaps related to RMBS transactions \nare valued based on assumptions about the behaviour of the underlying mortgage portfolio and the characteristics of \nthe\xc2\xa0transaction. Cash flows are forecast and discounted using appropriate forward and discount curves.\n\nA credit valuation adjustment (CVA) reflects counterparty credit risk in the fair value measurement of uncollateralised \nand\xc2\xa0partially collateralised OTC derivatives. For counterparties that do not have an observable credit spread, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO \napplies a proxied credit spread extracted from counterparties of comparable credit quality that do have an observable \ncredit spread. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO performs a probability of default assessment for each counterparty and allocates an \nappropriate internal credit risk measure known as a Uniform Counterparty Rating (UCR). This UCR, which is significant \nto\xc2\xa0the entire fair value measurement of the derivative contracts included in the following table of level 3 sensitivity \ninformation, is internally generated and is therefore an unobservable input.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership structureGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceOtherAnnual Financial Statements\x0cAnnual Financial Statements 2018  /  Notes to the Consolidated Annual\xc2\xa0Financial\xc2\xa0Statements\n\n215\n\n(in\xc2\xa0millions)\n\n31 December 2018\n\nEquity shares\n\nEquity shares\nInterest-earning securities \xe2\x80\x93 \n\nGovernment bonds\n\nInterest-earning securities \xe2\x80\x93  \n\nother\n\nDerivatives held  \n\nfor trading\n\nIssued debt\n\n31 December 2017 (IAS 39)\n\nEquity shares\n\nEquity shares\nInterest-earning securities \xe2\x80\x93 \n\nGovernment bonds\n\nInterest-earning securities \xe2\x80\x93  \n\nother\n\nDerivatives held  \n\nfor trading\n\nDerivatives not held for trading \xe2\x80\x93 \n\nassets/liabilities (net)\n\nIssued debt\n\nValuation \ntechnique\n\nUnobservable \ndata\n\nCarrying \nvalue\n\nPossible alternative \nassumptions\nApplying \nmaximum\n\nApplying \nminimum\n\nUnobservable  \ndata range\nApplying \nmaximum\n\nApplying \nminimum\n\nUnobservable \ndata base\n\nPrivate equity \nvaluation\nPrivate equity \nvaluation\nDiscounted \ncash flow\nDiscounted \ncash flow\nDiscounted \ncash flow\nDiscounted \n\nEBITDA \nmultiples\nNet asset \nvalue\nLiquidity and \ncredit spread\nLiquidity and \ncredit spread\nProbability of \ndefault\n\n59\n\n498\n\n419\n\n39\n\n97\n\ncash flow Credit spread\n\n156\n\nPrivate equity \nvaluation\n\nPrivate equity \nvaluation\n\nEBITDA \nmultiples\n\nNet asset \nvalue\n\nDiscounted \ncash flow\n\nLiquidity and \ncredit spread\n\nDiscounted \ncash flow\n\nLiquidity and \ncredit spread\n\nDiscounted \ncash flow\n\nProbability of \ndefault\n\nDiscounted \ncash flow\n\nPrepayment \nrate\n\nDiscounted \n\ncash flow Credit spread\n\n286\n\n483\n\n427\n\n43\n\n106\n\n168\n\n-7\n\n-24\n\n-26\n\n-5\n\n-1\n\n-38\n\n-18\n\n-27\n\n-9\n\n-5\n\n-1\n\n9\n\n24\n\n13\n\n2\n\n10\n\n1\n\n40\n\n15\n\n15\n\n2\n\n8\n\n8\n\n6.0\n\n6.0\n\n6.0\n\n36\n\n408\n\n124\n\n515\n\n65\n\n496\n\n0.2%\n\n100.0%\n\n27.3%\n\n100\n\n124\n\n109\n\n4.7\n\n8.3\n\n6.7\n\n17\n\n211\n\n105\n\n774\n\n47\n\n298\n\n0.2%\n\n100.0%\n\n16.7%\n\n97\n\n130\n\n111\n\n19  Loans and advances banks\n\nAccounting policy for loans and advances from banks and customers\nLoans and advances from banks and customers are held in a hold-to-collect business model.

These fair values were calculated for disclosure purposes only. Note that the fair value can be \nsignificantly impacted by the choice of valuation model and underlying assumptions concerning factors such as the \namount and timing of cash flows, discount rates, credit risk and liquidity risk.\n\nShort-term financial instruments\nThe carrying amounts (net of impairment allowances) of financial instruments maturing within a period of less than three \nmonths or that have no contractual maturity are assumed to be a reasonable approximation of their fair value. For certain \ninstruments, behavioural maturities are applied.\n\nShort-term financial instruments are classified as level 2 as unobservable inputs (such as inputs to determine credit risk, \nprepayment risk and liquidity risk) do not have a significant influence in determining the fair value.\n\nCash and balances at central banks\nCash and balances at central banks are classified as level 1 as these instruments have a short-term nature, prices from \nan active market are available and no fair value adjustments are made to the carrying amounts.\n\nSecurities financing\nSecurities financing includes repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending \ntransactions. Due to the short-term characteristics of these instruments and the value and liquidity of available collateral, \nthe carrying amounts (net of impairment allowances) are considered to approximate the fair value. Securities financing \namounts are classified as level 2.\n\nLoans and advances \xe2\x80\x93\xc2\xa0banks and customers\nThe fair value of loans and advances \xe2\x80\x93 banks and customers is estimated by a discounted cash flow model based on \ncontractual cash flows, using actual yields and discounting by risk-free interest rates. Adjustments to reflect changes \nin\xc2\xa0liquidity spreads are applied and prepayment options are included in the estimated fair value. The calculations are \nadjusted for credit risk by incorporating the expected credit losses over the estimated lifetime of the loan, based on \nparameters including probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default. The loans and advances are \nclassified as level 3 on the basis that unobservable inputs significantly influence the approximated fair values. The loans \nand advances for which unobservable inputs do not significantly influence the approximated fair values are classified as \nlevel 2. Behavioural maturities instead of contractual maturities are used to determine the level classification of a small \npart of the portfolio.\n\nCash collateral paid to counterparties in relation to Credit Support Annexes (CSA) is included in loans and advances \xe2\x80\x93 \nbanks and customers. Due to the short-term characteristics of these instruments, fair value is considered to approximate \nthe carrying amounts. The related amounts are classified as level 2.\n\nDue to banks and customers\nThe fair value of instruments such as deposits and borrowings included in due to banks and customers is estimated by \na\xc2\xa0discounted cash flow model based on risk-free interest rates. Adjustments to reflect changes in liquidity spreads are \napplied. Amounts due to banks and customers are classified as level 3 on the basis that unobservable inputs significantly \ninfluence the approximated fair values. The financial instruments for which unobservable inputs do not significantly \ninfluence the approximated fair values are classified as level 2.

Transaction costs incurred by ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO in connection with the business \ncombination, other than those associated with the issuance of debt and equity securities, do not form part of the cost \nof\xc2\xa0the business combination transaction but are expensed as incurred. The excess of the purchase consideration over \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s share of the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired (including certain contingent liabilities) is \nrecorded as goodwill. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO measures the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the fair value \nat the acquisition date.\n\nIn a\xc2\xa0step acquisition, where a\xc2\xa0business combination occurs in stages and control of the business is obtained in stages, \nthe identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree are recognised at fair value when control is obtained. A gain or loss \nis recognised in profit or loss as the difference between the fair value of the previously held equity interest in the \nacquiree and its carrying amount. Changes in interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a\xc2\xa0change of control are treated \nas transactions between equity holders and are reported in equity.\n\nAccounting policy for subsidiaries\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Group\xe2\x80\x99s subsidiaries are those entities which it directly or indirectly controls. Control over an entity is \nevidenced by ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s ability to exercise its power in order to affect the variable returns that ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO is exposed \nto through its involvement in the entity. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable \nare taken into account when assessing whether control exists.\n\nThe assessment of control is based on consideration of all facts and circumstances. The Group reassesses whether it \ncontrols an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of \ncontrol (power, exposure to variability in returns, and a\xc2\xa0link between the two).\n\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO sponsors entities, including certain special purpose entities, which may or may not be directly owned, for \nthe purpose of asset securitisation transactions and other specific and well-defined objectives. Particularly in the case of \nsecuritisations, these entities may acquire assets from ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO companies. Some of these entities hold assets that \nare not available to meet the claims of creditors of ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO or its subsidiaries. These entities are consolidated in \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s financial statements when the substance of the relationship between ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO and the entity indicates \nthat control is held by ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO.\n\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO is mainly involved in securitisations of own originated assets, such as various consumer and commercial \nfinancial assets. This process generally necessitates a\xc2\xa0sale of these assets to a\xc2\xa0special purpose entity (SPE), which in \nturn issues securities to investors. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s interests in securitised assets may be retained in the form of senior or \nsubordinated tranches, issued guarantees, interest-only strips or other residual interests, together referred to as retained \ninterests. In many cases, these retained interests convey control, such that the SPE is consolidated and the securitised \nassets continue to be recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position.\n\nThe financial statements of subsidiaries and special purpose entities are included in the Consolidated Annual Financial \nStatements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases.\n\nAccounting policy for associates and joint ventures\nAssociates are those entities in which ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO has significant influence on, but no control or joint control over, the \noperating and financial policies. Significant influence is generally presumed when ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO holds between 20% and \n50% of the voting rights. Potential voting rights that are currently exercisable are considered in assessing whether \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO has significant influence. Among other factors, representation on the board of directors, participation in the \npolicy-making process and material transactions between the entity and the investee are considered to determine \nsignificant influence.\n\nA joint venture is an investment in which two or more parties have contractually agreed to share control over the \ninvestment. Joint control exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of \nthe\xc2\xa0parties sharing control. The activities conducted through joint ventures include cash transfers, insurance, finance \nand\xc2\xa0leasing.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadershipGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceOtherAnnual Financial Statements\x0cAnnual Financial Statements 2018  /  Notes to the Consolidated Annual\xc2\xa0Financial\xc2\xa0Statements\n\n220\n\nInvestments in associates and joint ventures, including strategic investments, are accounted for using the equity \nmethod. Under this method, the investment is initially recorded at cost and subsequently increased (or decreased) for \npost-acquisition net income (or loss), other movements impacting on the equity of the investee and any adjustments \nrequired for impairment. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s share of the profit or loss of the investee is recognised in other operating income \nin the income statement. If ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s share of losses exceeds the carrying amount of the investment, the carrying \namount is reduced to zero, including any other unsecured receivables, and recognition of further losses is discontinued \nexcept if ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the investee.\n\nEquity investments held without significant influence and which are not held for trading are measured at fair value \nthrough profit or loss as ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO does not apply the option to measure such investments at fair value through other \ncomprehensive income.\n\nAssets and liabilities of acquisitions and divestments\nThe following table provides details of the assets and liabilities resulting from the acquisition or disposal of subsidiaries \nand equity accounted investments at the date of acquisition or disposal.\n\n(in\xc2\xa0millions)\n\nAssets and liabilities of acquisitions and divestments\nCash and balances at central banks\nDerivatives\nFinancial investments\nLoans and advances banks\nLoans and advances customers\nEquity accounted investments\nOther assets\nDerivatives\nDue to banks\nDue to customers\nProvisions\nTax liabilities\nOther liabilities\nOther non-controlling interests\nNet assets acquired/Net assets divested\nResult on divestments, gross\nCash used for acquisitions/received from divestments:\nTotal purchase consideration/Proceeds from sale\nCash and cash equivalents acquired/divested\nCash used for acquisitions/received from divestments\n\nAcquisitions\n\n31 December 2018\nDivestments\n\nAcquisitions\n\n31 December 2017\nDivestments\n\n-246\n-1\n-35\n-2,225\n-274\n-123\n-2,435\n1\n99\n2,115\n57\n8\n2,690\n\n-368\n42\n\n410\n-86\n324\n\n129\n\n129\n\n-129\n\n-129\n\n-16\n-28\n-12\n-3,186\n-57\n-1\n4\n\n4,641\n39\n\n1\n\n1,384\n327\n\n-1,057\n-6\n-1,063\n\n12\n\n12\n\n-12\n\n-12\n\nAcquisitions in 2018\nAcquisitions include investments in several equity accounted investments in 2018.\n\nDivestments in 2018\nOn 16 November 2018, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO announced its plan to sell part of its stake in the investment funds of \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xc2\xa0Participaties Fund III, V, VI and VII.

The decrease was\xc2\xa0due to the calling of several \nsecuritisation transactions.\n\nThe securitisation transactions are primarily used for funding and liquidity purposes. There was no RWA relief  \nat 31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: no relief).\n\nIn 2018, the bank had only true sale (i.e. traditional) securitisation transactions outstanding. In such transactions, \na\xc2\xa0foundation (stichting) incorporates a\xc2\xa0bankruptcy-remote, structured entity, to which\xc2\xa0the legal title of a\xc2\xa0portfolio of \nreceivables is sold. As ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO continues to recognise the assets after the legal title has been sold, no derecognition \ntakes place. The structured entity issues notes\xc2\xa0to fund the purchase. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO performs key ancillary roles in all its \nsecuritisation transactions, including swap counterparty.\n\nRisks associated with the roles in the securitisation process\nCredit risk\nCredit risk relates to the risk of credit losses on securitised assets. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO retains part of the credit risk by retaining \nnotes and other securitisation positions such as liquidity facilities, swaps and first loss tranches. Regulatory capital is \nheld for all retained securitisation positions in accordance with the applicable regulation.\n\nLiquidity risk\nLiquidity risk relates to the risk that ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO may incur additional cash outflows. Any potential future cash outflows \nrelating to these positions, including collateral requirements, are taken into account within stress tests and are \nintegrated into the liquidity ratios, where required. This includes the potential impact of the liquidity facilities or swap \nagreements that form part of certain securitisation transactions, most of which relate to transactions where ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO \nis the originator of the underlying assets.\n\nApproaches to calculating risk exposure amount\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO does not achieve significant risk transfers for any of the mortgage securitisations. Therefore, the look-\nthrough approach is used and RWA reduction is not applied.\n\nMonitoring process\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO periodically monitors changes in credit risk relating to securitisation exposures. The significance of the \namount of credit risk transferred to third parties by securitisation of own originated assets is assessed on a\xc2\xa0monthly \nbasis in accordance with the regulatory significant risk transfer test. For investments in third-party securitisations, the \nrisk is monitored by reviewing the investor reports of these transactions. Additionally, third-party securitisation positions \nare included in the firm-wide comprehensive stress tests in which the downgrade and default risks under stressed \nmarket conditions are assessed.\xc2\xa0\n\nOverview of securitisation positions and securitised assets\nThe total amount of assets securitised in true sale securitisations decreased to EUR\xc2\xa021.6\xc2\xa0billion at 31 December 2018 \n(31\xc2\xa0December 2017: EUR\xc2\xa032.8\xc2\xa0billion).

ABN \nAMRO is involved with structured entities through securitisation of financial assets and investments in structured \nentities. Structured entities generally finance the purchase of assets by issuing debt and equity securities that are \ncollateralised by the assets held by the structured entities. The debt and equity securities issued by the structured \nentities may include tranches with varying levels of subordination. The interest in non-consolidated structured entities \nincreased with EUR 1.1 billion to EUR 3.6 billion at year-end 2018 (2017: EUR 2.6 billion). The interests consist mainly of \ndebt securities in corporate loans of EUR 421 million (2017: EUR 4 million) and mortgage- and other asset-backed \nsecurities recognised under financial investments of 3.2 billion (2017: EUR 2.6 billion). The maximum exposure to losses \nfrom these interests is equal to the total carrying amount.\n\nSponsoring of unconsolidated structured entities.\nAn entity is considered a\xc2\xa0sponsor of an unconsolidated structured entity if it had a\xc2\xa0key role in establishing that entity so \nthat the transaction, which is the purpose of the entity, could occur. No material sponsoring occurred in 2018.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership structureGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceOtherAnnual Financial Statements\x0cAnnual Financial Statements 2018  /  Notes to the Consolidated Annual\xc2\xa0Financial\xc2\xa0Statements\n\n225\n\n23  Property and equipment, goodwill and\xc2\xa0other\xc2\xa0intangible\xc2\xa0assets\n\nAccounting policy for property and equipment\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment amount. At each balance \nsheet date, an assessment is performed to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. Subsequent costs \nare capitalised if these result in an enhancement to the asset. Depreciation is charged to the income statement on \na\xc2\xa0straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of items of property and equipment, and of major components that \nare accounted for separately. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO generally uses the following useful lives in calculating depreciation:\n \xc3\x85 Land: not depreciated;\n \xc3\x85 Buildings: 30 years;\n \xc3\x85 Leasehold improvements: 5 years;\n \xc3\x85 Equipment: 5 years;\n \xc3\x85 Installations (durable): 10 years;\n \xc3\x85 Computer installations: 2 to 5 years.\n\nImpairment losses are recognised in the income statement as a component of depreciation and amortisation expense. \nImpairment losses are reversed only to the extent that the asset\xe2\x80\x99s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount \nthat would have been determined if no impairment loss had previously been recognised.\n\nDepreciation rates and residual values are reviewed at least periodically to take into account any change in \ncircumstances. Capitalised leasehold improvements are depreciated in a manner that takes into account the term and \nrenewal conditions of the related lease.\n\nAssets for which the bank acts as a lessor in an operational lease contract are included in property and equipment. \nThe\xc2\xa0asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis, over its useful life, to its estimated residual value.\n\nAccounting policy for intangible assets\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is capitalised and stated at cost, being the excess of the consideration paid over the fair value of ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s \nshare of the acquired entity\xe2\x80\x99s net identifiable assets at the acquisition date, less any accumulated impairment losses. For \nthe purpose of calculating goodwill, the fair values of acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are determined \nby reference to market values or by discounting expected future cash flows to present value. Goodwill is not amortised, \nbut is reviewed annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that impairment may have occurred. \nIn the test, the carrying amount of goodwill is compared with the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value \nin use, being the present value of the cash flows discounted at a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the risk of the \ncash-generating unit to which the goodwill relates. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement as \ndepreciation and amortisation expense and are irreversible.\n\nSoftware and other intangible assets\nThe accounting policy for software and other intangible assets is determined by IAS 38 Intangible assets. Software \nis\xc2\xa0amortised over a period of three years, unless the software is classified as core application software, which is \ndepreciated over its estimated useful life, set at a maximum of seven years. Only the development phase is capitalised \nfor own-developed software.\n\nOther intangible assets include separately identifiable items arising from acquisitions of subsidiaries, such as customer \nrelationships, and certain purchased trademarks and similar items. In general, the estimated useful life does not exceed \nten years. Amortisation rates and residual values are reviewed at least annually to take into account any change in \ncircumstances.\n\n(in\xc2\xa0millions)\n\nLand and buildings held for own use\nLeasehold improvements\nEquipment\nOther\nTotal property and equipment\n\n31 December 2018\n\n31 December 2017\n\n616\n46\n844\n\n1,506\n\n648\n49\n761\n1\n1,458\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadershipGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceOtherAnnual Financial Statements\x0cAnnual Financial Statements 2018  /  Notes to the Consolidated Annual\xc2\xa0Financial\xc2\xa0Statements\n\n226\n\nTotal property and equipment increased by EUR\xc2\xa048\xc2\xa0million to EUR\xc2\xa01,506\xc2\xa0million at 31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: \nEUR\xc2\xa01,458\xc2\xa0million).

Hybrid or structured financial liabilities are irrevocably designated upon initial recognition to be measured at fair \nvalue through profit or loss. The latter is applied when the instruments are held to reduce an accounting mismatch, are \nmanaged on the basis of their fair value or include terms that qualify as an embedded derivative that cannot be separated.\n\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO applies IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation to determine whether funding is a financial liability or \nequity. Issued financial instruments or their components are classified as financial liabilities where the substance of the \ncontractual arrangement results in ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO having a present obligation to deliver either cash or another financial \nasset or to satisfy the obligation other than by the exchange of a fixed number of equity shares. Preference shares that \ncarry a non-discretionary coupon or are redeemable on a specific date or at the option of the holder are classified as \nliabilities. Dividends and fees on preference shares classified as a liability are recognised as interest expense.\n\nIssued liabilities qualify as subordinated debt if claims by the holders are subordinated to all other current and future \nliabilities of ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO and its subsidiaries.\n\nThe valuation of liabilities measured at fair value includes the effect of changes in own credit spreads. The change in fair \nvalue applies to those financial liabilities designated at fair value where own credit risk would be considered by market \nparticipants. The cumulative amount of changes in fair value attributable to credit risk of issued debt is presented as \nliability own credit risk reserve in equity. Exchange-traded own debt measured at fair value through profit or loss is \nvalued against market prices.\n\nFair value changes are calculated based on a yield curve generated from observed external pricing for funding and \nquoted CDS spreads.\n\nThe following table shows the types of debt certificates issued by ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO and the amounts outstanding \nat\xc2\xa031\xc2\xa0December.

If the effect of time value is material, provisions are \ndetermined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market rates and, where \nappropriate, the risks specific to the liability.\n\nA provision for restructuring is recognised when an obligation exists. An obligation exists when ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO has \napproved a detailed plan and has raised a valid expectation in those affected by the plan by starting to implement the \nplan or by announcing its main features. Future operating costs are not provided for. Provisions for insurance risks are \ndetermined by actuarial methods, which include the use of statistics, interest rate data and settlement cost expectations.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership structureGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceOtherAnnual Financial Statements\x0cAnnual Financial Statements 2018  /  Notes to the Consolidated Annual\xc2\xa0Financial\xc2\xa0Statements\n\n233\n\nProvisions are established for certain guarantee contracts for which ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO is responsible to pay upon default of \npayment.

The insurance fund liabilities decreased significantly by EUR\xc2\xa051\xc2\xa0million to EUR\xc2\xa011\xc2\xa0million at 31 December 2018, \nmainly due to the sale of ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Life Capital Belgium N.V.\n\nProvision for pension commitments\nProvision for pension commitments includes early retirement benefits payable to non-active employees. Further details \nare provided in note 30.       \n\nRestructuring\nRestructuring provisions cover the costs of the restructuring plans for which implementation has been formally \nannounced. The decrease in the restructuring provisions was caused mainly by their use for the initiatives that are the \nresult of further digitalisation and process optimisation. The new restructuring provisions relate mainly to the refocusing \nof the Commercial Banking and Corporate & Institutional Banking strategy, combined with initiatives resulting from \nfurther digitalisation and process optimisation activities. Implementation of the 2018 restructuring plans will start \nwithin\xc2\xa0one year. The estimated costs are based on the ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Social Plan. Settlement may take up to five years.\n\nOther staff provisions\nOther staff provisions relate mainly to disability and other post-employee benefits.\n\nLegal provisions\nLegal provisions are based on best estimates available at the year-end and taking into account the opinion of legal \nspecialists. The timing of the outflow of cash related to these provisions is by nature uncertain, given the unpredictability \nof the outcome and the time required to conclude litigation. Any provision recognised does not constitute an admission \nof wrongdoing or legal liability. Legal provisions decreased by EUR\xc2\xa00.2 billion to EUR\xc2\xa00.5 billion at 31 December 2018, \nmainly due to payments related to the provision for interest rate derivatives to SME clients.\n\nInterest rate derivatives for SME clients\nIn 2015 ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO started a review, at the request of the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) and \nthe Dutch Ministry of Finance, to determine whether the bank had acted in accordance with its duty of care obligations \nin respect of the sale of interest rate derivatives to SME clients. In the second quarter of 2015, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO first \nrecognised a provision for compensating clients who had been disadvantaged in this respect and suffered loss or damage. \n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadershipGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceOtherAnnual Financial Statements\x0cAnnual Financial Statements 2018  /  Notes to the Consolidated Annual\xc2\xa0Financial\xc2\xa0Statements\n\n234\n\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO has set up its own client reassessment process and the related checks and balances with respect to the \nUniform Recovery Framework devised by a committee of independent experts (\xe2\x80\x98the Committee\xe2\x80\x99) appointed by the \nDutch\xc2\xa0Minister of Finance. On 31 December 2018, 80% of the clients received a letter containing the outcome of \nthe\xc2\xa0reassessment. It is envisaged that the remaining clients will receive the outcome of the reassessment in the first \nquarter of 2019. At various points in the process, the reassessments will be checked by an independent external file \nreviewer (in ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s case, by the audit firm PwC), supervised by the AFM. The total provision for SME derivatives-\nrelated issues amounted to EUR\xc2\xa00.3\xc2\xa0billion at 31 December 2018. This comprised the total amount of client compensation \n(EUR\xc2\xa00.5\xc2\xa0billion) and project costs (EUR\xc2\xa00.2\xc2\xa0billion), after payments already made for both elements (EUR\xc2\xa00.5\xc2\xa0billion).\n\nEuribor-based mortgages\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO has sold mortgage loans with floating, often Euribor-based, interest rates to consumers. These rates include \na margin charge. Under the applicable terms and conditions, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO has the right to unilaterally adjust the margin \ncharge. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s decision to increase the margin charge in 2012 resulted in two class actions, on top of multiple \nindividual cases, being instigated. The central question in these cases is whether ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s right in the terms and \ncondition to unilaterally adjust the margin charge is an unfair contractual clause. \n\nAfter losing the class action in two instances, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO decided to appeal at the Dutch Supreme Court. The final \ndocuments in the appeal process were filed in late August 2018. The Procurator General of the Supreme Court is \nexpected to issue advice towards the end of the first quarter of 2019. The Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s verdict is expected \napproximately three months after this advice; in other words, by the end of the second quarter of 2019. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO \nhas\xc2\xa0recognised a provision for this matter.\n\nICS redress scheme\nInternational Card Services B.V. (ICS), the credit card business of ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO, has identified certain issues from its past \nin respect of the granting of credit to consumers, as a result of which certain clients were provided with loans above \ntheir lending capacity. This was reported to the AFM. In March 2017, ICS drafted a redress scheme setting out remedial \nmeasures for clients who have been affected and including financial compensation for certain clients. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO has \nrecognised a provision in respect of this scheme. The\xc2\xa0recovery framework has now been implemented and the final \ncompensation payments are expected to be made in early 2019. \n\nCredit Commitment provisions\nCredit commitment provisions increased by EUR\xc2\xa057\xc2\xa0million to EUR\xc2\xa063\xc2\xa0million at 31 December 2018 due to the transition \nto IFRS 9. More information can be found in the transition disclosure in Accounting Policies. \n\nOther provisions\nOther provisions include provisions for tax purposes. The tax provisions are based on best estimates available at the \nyear-end and taking into account the opinion of tax specialists. The timing of the outflow of cash related to these \nprovisions is by nature uncertain, given the unpredictability of the outcome and the time involved.    \n\nBanks have a responsibility to help protect the financial services sector. We take this responsibility very seriously. \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO invests significant resources in combating financial crime. We work closely with regulators, governments, \nother banks and the police.\xc2\xa0ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO has decided, based on existing shortcomings and input from the Dutch Central \nBank, to accelerate its Customer Due Diligence (CDD) programme in order to be compliant with anti-money laundering \nand terrorist financing legislation. We\xe2\x80\x99ve already carried out a review of our Corporate & Institutional Banking business; \na\xc2\xa0review of our Private Banking clients is now nearly complete. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO has developed remediation programmes \nto\xc2\xa0speed up remediation actions in relation to International Card Services (ICS) and Commercial Banking and has shared \nthese with the Dutch Central Bank and committed to their execution. For the incremental external costs involved, we\xe2\x80\x99ve \ntaken a provision in 2018 of EUR\xc2\xa085\xc2\xa0million \xe2\x80\x93 for ICS and Commercial Banking. The amount is based on, among other \nitems, the total number of files, the time needed to review each file and the percentage that will be reviewed using \nexternal resources. Over the past year, a number of European banks have been the object of money laundering \ninvestigations. We recognise that, with financial crime, we have to be vigilant. We\xe2\x80\x99re constantly looking for ways \nto\xc2\xa0strengthen our systems and raise awareness of potential risks within the bank.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership structureGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceOtherAnnual Financial Statements\x0cAnnual Financial Statements 2018  /  Notes to the Consolidated Annual\xc2\xa0Financial\xc2\xa0Statements\n\n235\n\nChanges in provisions during the year were as follows:\n\n(in\xc2\xa0millions)\n\nAt 1 January 2017\nAcquisition and divestment of subsidiaries\nIncrease of provisions\nReversal of unused provisions\nUtilised during the year\nAccretion of interest\nForeign exchange differences\nOther\nAt 31 December 2017\nImpact of adopting IFRS 9\nAt 1 January 2018\nAcquisition and divestment of subsidiaries\nIncrease of provisions\nReversal of unused provisions\nUtilised during the year\nAccretion of interest\nForeign exchange differences\nOther\nAt 31 December 2018\n\nInsurance \nfund  \nliabilities\n\nProvision for \npension  \ncommitments\n\nRestruc-\nturing \nprovision\n\nOther staff \nprovision\n\nLegal  \nprovisions\n\nCredit  \ncommitments\n\nOther\n\nTotal\n\n127\n-39\n\n-10\n\n-16\n62\n\n62\n-55\n\n4\n11\n\n86\n\n-10\n76\n\n76\n\n-9\n66\n\n417\n\n222\n-17\n-218\n\n404\n\n404\n\n147\n-18\n-227\n\n1\n-13\n294\n\n117\n\n5\n122\n\n122\n\n-5\n117\n\n731\n\n257\n-21\n-281\n4\n\n2\n692\n\n692\n\n89\n-14\n-293\n2\n\n-1\n475\n\n8\n\n1\n-1\n\n6\n61\n67\n\n25\n-23\n\n-6\n63\n\n186\n\n20\n-34\n-4\n2\n-1\n-1\n167\n\n167\n-1\n98\n-19\n-71\n\n4\n178\n\n1,672\n-39\n499\n-84\n-503\n6\n-2\n-20\n1,529\n61\n1,590\n-57\n358\n-73\n-591\n2\n1\n-26\n1,204\n\n30  Pension and other post-retirement benefits\n\nAccounting policy for pension and other post-retirement benefits\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO sponsors a number of pension schemes in the Netherlands and abroad. These schemes are mainly defined \ncontribution plans. The majority of the beneficiaries of the plans are located in the Netherlands.\n\nDefined contribution plans\nFor defined contribution plans, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO pays annual contributions that have been determined by a fixed method \nand\xc2\xa0has no legal or constructive obligation to pay any further contributions. Contributions are recognised directly in the \nincome statement in the year to which they relate. Actuarial and investment risk are for the account of the participants \nin\xc2\xa0the plan.\n\nDefined benefit plans\nFor defined benefit plans, the net obligation of each plan is the difference between the present value of the defined \nbenefit obligations and the fair value of the plan\xe2\x80\x99s assets.\n\nThe actuarial assumptions used for calculating the present value of the defined benefit obligation include discount rates \nbased on high-quality corporate bonds, the inflation rate, future salary increases, employee contributions, mortality \nassumptions and rates of employee turnover. The assumptions are based on available market data and management \nexpectations at the end of the reporting period.\n\nPlan assets are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date and are netted against the defined benefit obligations.\n\nPension costs recognised in the income statement for defined benefit plans consist of:\n \xc3\x85 service costs;\n \xc3\x85 net interest costs determined by multiplying the net defined benefit liability (asset) by the discount rate, both as \n\nat\xc2\xa0the start of the annual reporting period, taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability (asset) \nduring the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments; and\n\n \xc3\x85 curtailments or plan amendments.\n\nDifferences between pension costs and pension contributions payable are accounted for as provisions or prepayments.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadershipGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceOtherAnnual Financial Statements\x0cAnnual Financial Statements 2018  /  Notes to the Consolidated Annual\xc2\xa0Financial\xc2\xa0Statements\n\n236\n\nRemeasurement\nRemeasurements of the net defined benefit liability (asset) are actuarial gains and losses resulting from changes in \nactuarial assumptions and experience adjustments (i.e. unexpectedly high or low rates of employee turnover). They are \nrecognised in other comprehensive income and are not recycled to profit or loss in later periods. The actual return on \nplan assets is determined after deduction of costs of managing the plan assets and any tax payable by the plan itself.\n\nOther post-retirement benefits\nSome group companies provide post-retirement benefits to their retirees such as long-term service benefits and \ndiscounts on banking products. Entitlement to these benefits is usually conditional on the employee remaining in service \nup to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period.\n\nThe expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment using the same accounting \nmethodology as used for defined benefit pension plans. These obligations are calculated annually.\n\nPlans in all countries comply with applicable local regulations concerning investments and minimum funding levels.\n\nPension and other post-retirement benefits\nAmounts recognised in the income statement for pensions and other post-retirement benefits\n\n(in\xc2\xa0millions)\n\nCurrent service cost\nInterest cost\nInterest income\nAmortisation of unrecognised past service cost\nAssumption changes in demographics through P&L\nOther\nTotal defined benefit expenses  \nin actuarial report\nOther expenses\nTotal defined benefit expenses\nDefined contribution plans\nTotal Pension expenses and other \npost\xc2\xa0retirement employee benefits\n\n2018\n\nOther post  \nretirement  \nemployee benefits\n\nPensions\n\nTotal\n\nPensions\n\nOther post  \nretirement  \nemployee benefits\n\n4\n4\n-3\n\n-1\n\n4\n-2\n2\n338\n\n340\n\n16\n1\n\n-1\n\n16\n-11\n5\n\n20\n5\n-3\n\n-2\n\n20\n-13\n7\n338\n\n5\n\n345\n\n4\n2\n-1\n-6\n\n-1\n1\n\n369\n\n369\n\n10\n1\n\n10\n\n21\n-7\n13\n\n13\n\n2017\n\nTotal\n\n14\n3\n-1\n-6\n10\n\n20\n-7\n13\n369\n\n382\n\nTotal pension and other post-retirement employee benefits expenses decreased by EUR 37 million to EUR 345 million in \n2018, compared with EUR 382 million in 2017. The decrease in defined contribution plans of EUR 31 million is mainly due \nto the decrease in contribution costs that resulted from the decrease in FTEs. Pension expenses for defined contribution \nplans consist mainly of the cash contributions to the Dutch Collective Defined Contribution plan.\n\nThe remaining other post-employee benefits relating to defined plans consist mainly of several minor defined benefit \nplans.

More detailed information on our recognition and \nderecognition policy is provided in the paragraph on significant accounting policies under note 1 Accounting policies.\n\nPledged assets are assets pledged as collateral for liabilities or contingent liabilities and the terms and conditions \nrelating\xc2\xa0to the pledge. Encumbered assets are those that are pledged or other assets which we believe to be restricted \nin order to secure, credit-enhance or collateralise a transaction.\n\nIn principle, pledged assets are encumbered assets. The following differences apply to ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO:\n \xc3\x85 Encumbered assets include mandatory reserve requirements with central banks and unit-linked investments;\n \xc3\x85 Encumbered assets exclude assets pledged for unused credit facilities with central banks at the statement of \n\nfinancial position date, i.e. mainly retained mortgage-backed securities.\n\nSignificant restrictions on assets may arise from statutory, contractual or regulatory requirements such as:\n \xc3\x85 those that restrict the ability of the parent or its subsidiaries to transfer cash or other financial assets to or \n\nfrom\xc2\xa0other\xc2\xa0entities within the Group;\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership structureGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceOtherAnnual Financial Statements\x0cAnnual Financial Statements 2018  /  Notes to the Consolidated Annual\xc2\xa0Financial\xc2\xa0Statements\n\n241\n\n \xc3\x85 guarantees or other requirements that may restrict dividends and other capital distributions being paid, or loans \n\nand\xc2\xa0advances being made or repaid to other entities within the Group;\n\n \xc3\x85 protective rights of other non-controlling interests that may restrict the ability of the Group to access and transfer \n\nassets freely to or from other entities within the Group and to settle liabilities of the Group.\n\nTransferred financial assets\nThis disclosure provides insight into the relationship between these transferred financial assets and associated \nfinancial\xc2\xa0liabilities in order to show the risks the bank is exposed to when the assets are transferred.

The \ncounterparty in the transactions holds the securities as collateral, but has no recourse to other assets of ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO. \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO transfers the securities and if the counterparty has the right to resell or repledge them, the bank considers \nthese assets to be transferred assets.\n\nContinuing involvement in transferred financial assets derecognised in their entirety\nThe bank does not have any material transferred assets that are derecognised in their entirety, but where ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO \nhas continuing involvement.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadershipGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceOtherAnnual Financial Statements\x0cAnnual Financial Statements 2018  /  Notes to the Consolidated Annual\xc2\xa0Financial\xc2\xa0Statements\n\n242\n\nPledged and encumbered assets\nPledged and encumbered assets are no longer readily available to the Group to secure funding, satisfy collateral needs \nor be sold to reduce the funding requirement.

Acceptances comprise \nundertakings by ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO to pay bills of exchange drawn on clients. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO expects most acceptances to be \nsettled simultaneously with the reimbursement from clients. Acceptances are not recognised in the balance sheet \nand\xc2\xa0are disclosed as commitments.\n\nFinancial guarantee contracts\nA financial guarantee contract requires the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it \nincurs\xc2\xa0if a specified debtor fails to make payment when due under the original or modified terms of a debt instrument. \nInitial recognition of financial guarantee contracts is at their fair value. Subsequent measurement is at the higher of the \namount of the expected credit loss and the amount initially recognised less, when appropriate, the cumulative amount \nof\xc2\xa0income recognised in the income statement.\n\nContingencies\nContingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be confirmed only by uncertain future events, and \npresent obligations where the transfer of economic resources is uncertain or cannot be reliably measured. Contingent \nliabilities are not recognised in the balance sheet but are disclosed unless the outflow of economic resources is remote.\n\nCommitted credit facilities\nCommitments to provide credit take the form of approved but undrawn loans, revolving and underwriting facilities. \nNew\xc2\xa0loan offers have a commitment period that does not extend beyond the normal underwriting and settlement period.\n\nGuarantees and other commitments\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO provides financial guarantees and letters of credit to guarantee the performance of customers to third \nparties. These transactions have fixed limits and generally extend for periods of up to 5 years. Expirations are not \nconcentrated in any particular period. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO also provides guarantees by acting as a settlement agent in securities \nborrowing and lending transactions. \n \nMany of the contingent liabilities and commitments are expected to expire without being paid out in whole or in part. \nThis means that the amounts stated do not represent expected future cash flows. Additionally, guarantees and letters \nof\xc2\xa0credit are supported by varying levels of collateral. \n \nFurthermore, statements of liability within the meaning of Article 403 Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code have been issued \nfor a number of ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s affiliated companies (see also the chapter on Other information). \n \n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadershipGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceOtherAnnual Financial Statements\x0cAnnual Financial Statements 2018  /  Notes to the Consolidated Annual\xc2\xa0Financial\xc2\xa0Statements\n\n244\n\nThe committed credit facilities, guarantees and other commitments at 31 December 2018 and 2017 are summarised \nin\xc2\xa0the following table.

This increase was due to a rise of EUR\xc2\xa05.9\xc2\xa0billion in committed \ncredit facilities, partly offset by a decrease of EUR\xc2\xa00.9\xc2\xa0billion in guarantees and other commitments. \n \nDuring the second half of 2018 ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO assessed the application of its definitions relating to committed and \nuncommitted credit facilities. This resulted in a restatement of committed credit facilities at 31 December 2017. \nMore\xc2\xa0information on this restatement can be found in note 1. The increase in committed credit facilities by \nEUR\xc2\xa05.9\xc2\xa0billion to EUR\xc2\xa061.2\xc2\xa0billion at 31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: EUR\xc2\xa055.3\xc2\xa0billion) was mainly related \nto\xc2\xa0an\xc2\xa0increase in credit lines granted to commercial clients, government and official institutions, partly offset by lower \ncredit\xc2\xa0lines granted to consumers and lower outstanding credit offers on residential mortgages. \n\nLeasing\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO mainly enters into leases classified as operating leases (including property rentals). The total payments \nmade under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. \nLease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense. If it \nis\xc2\xa0decided that an operating lease will be terminated or vacated before the lease period has expired, the lesser of any \npenalty payments required and the remaining payments due once vacated (less sub-leasing income) is recognised as \nan\xc2\xa0expense. If the lease agreement transfers substantially all the risks and rewards inherent to ownership of the asset, \nthe lease is recorded as a finance lease and the related asset is capitalised.\n\nOperating lease commitments\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO leases various offices and other premises under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements. The leases \nhave various terms, escalation and renewal rights. No contingent rents are payable. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO also leases equipment \nunder non-cancellable lease arrangements. Total operating lease arrangements amounted to EUR\xc2\xa00.4\xc2\xa0billion at \n31\xc2\xa0December 2018 (31 December 2017: EUR\xc2\xa00.4\xc2\xa0billion), of which EUR\xc2\xa00.3\xc2\xa0billion (31 December 2017: EUR\xc2\xa00.3\xc2\xa0billion) \nis\xc2\xa0due within five years.\n\nOther contingencies\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO is involved in a number of legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business in various jurisdictions. \nIn\xc2\xa0presenting consolidated financial information, management makes estimates regarding the outcome of legal, \nregulatory and arbitration matters, and takes provisions to the income statement when losses with respect to such \nmatters are more likely than not.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership structureGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceOtherAnnual Financial Statements\x0cAnnual Financial Statements 2018  /  Notes to the Consolidated Annual\xc2\xa0Financial\xc2\xa0Statements\n\n245\n\nProvisions are not recognised for matters for which expected cash outflow cannot be reasonably estimated or that \nare not more likely than not to lead to a cash outflow. Some of these matters may be regarded as a contingency. It is \nnot practicable to provide an aggregate estimate of potential liability for our legal proceedings and regulatory matters \nas a class of contingent liabilities. On the basis of information currently available, and having taken counsel with legal \nadvisors, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO is of the opinion that the outcome of these proceedings is unlikely to have a material adverse \neffect on the consolidated financial position and the consolidated result of ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO. In particular the following \nmatters are regarded as contingencies.\n \xc3\x85 Certain hedge funds initiated proceedings in Belgium and claimed the re-issue of certain Ageas Mandatory Convertible \nSecurities and payment of a 8.75% coupon from 7 December 2010 until 7 December 2030 (EUR\xc2\xa00.2 billion per annum) \nor, alternatively, compensation in cash for the amount of EUR\xc2\xa01.75 billion from four issuers, among which ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO, \nin relation to the conversion of Ageas MCS.\xc2\xa0On 23 March 2012, the Commercial Court in Brussels (Belgium) rejected \nall the hedge funds\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0claims. This judgement was in line with\xc2\xa0the earlier judgement in the summary proceedings \nof\xc2\xa0November 2010.\xc2\xa0On 1 February 2019, the Court of Appeal in Brussels rejected all the claims of the hedge funds \n(and found in favour of Ageas and ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO). The hedge funds have until 1 May 2019 to file cassation proceedings.\n\n \xc3\x85 As previously reported, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO, certain of its subsidiaries and some of their client funds had exposure to \n\nfunds that suffered losses (in some cases, significant losses) as a result of the Madoff fraud. Provision of custodial \nservices has resulted in a number of legal claims, including by the Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities\xc2\xa0trustee \nin bankruptcy (Irving Picard)\xc2\xa0and liquidators of certain funds, who are pursuing\xc2\xa0legal action\xc2\xa0in an attempt\xc2\xa0to recover \npayments made as a result of the fraud and/or to compensate their alleged losses. Certain ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO subsidiaries \nare defendants in these proceedings. In view of the preliminary status of these claims, it is not possible to estimate \nthe total amount of ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s potential liability, if any.\xc2\xa0\n\n \xc3\x85 The Imtech Group was declared bankrupt in August 2015. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO was one of the banks that extended financing \n\nto this group and participated in the second rights offering of October 2014. By letter of 20 January 2018, Stichting \nImtechclaim and Imtech Shareholders Action Group B.V. held ING, Rabobank, Commerzbank and ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO liable \nfor alleged\xc2\xa0misstatements in the prospectuses and for alleged\xc2\xa0actio pauliana (fraudulent preference). By letter \nof 28 March 2018 the VEB held parties including ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO liable for damage\xc2\xa0allegedly suffered by the Imtech \ninvestors. On 10 August 2018, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xc2\xa0received\xc2\xa0formal notification from Imtech\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0trustees that they were \nseeking to nullify a large number of transactions and\xc2\xa0claim\xc2\xa0various damages. The letter aimed\xc2\xa0to\xc2\xa0interrupt limitation \nperiods in view of the\xc2\xa0possible claims on Imtech\xe2\x80\x99s lenders, bondholders and underwriting banks. Two execution-only \nclients of ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO have commenced proceedings against ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO and are claiming an amount in excess of \nEUR\xc2\xa0600,000. Their claim is based on alleged prospectus liability, together\xc2\xa0with an alleged breach of the duty of care.\n\n \xc3\x85 On 18 October 2018, Eurostar Diamond Traders N.V. (EDT) filed a civil law complaint against ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO in the \n\nAntwerp Court, claiming a provisional\xc2\xa0amount of USD 720\xc2\xa0million. The composition and substantiation of the amount \nclaimed are\xc2\xa0not totally clear, but would seem\xc2\xa0to include an unsubstantiated claim for damages of EUR\xc2\xa0600\xc2\xa0million on \nthe ground\xc2\xa0that\xc2\xa0ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO allegedly caused EDT\xe2\x80\x99s demise deliberately. Damages of USD 73\xc2\xa0million have also been \nclaimed for\xc2\xa0the alleged\xc2\xa0sale of unsuitable derivatives over a long period of time. Provisional liquidators of Eurostar \nhave since been appointed.\n\n \xc3\x85 On 16 August 2016, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO received a writ of summons from a housing corporation, Stichting Havensteder \n(Havensteder), relating to two extendable loans (\xe2\x80\x98the Loans\xe2\x80\x99) with a total principal\xc2\xa0of EUR\xc2\xa064\xc2\xa0million. Havensteder \nclaimed\xc2\xa0partial annulment of the extendable part of the Loans since, according to Havensteder, the Loans conflicted \nwith the interest of public housing and public housing laws. Alternatively, Havensteder claimed\xc2\xa0that, as a result of \nunforeseen circumstances, the interest rates on the Loans should be reduced\xc2\xa0to approximately 2.45% or 3.0%. \nIn\xc2\xa0the further alternative, Havensteder claimed\xc2\xa0partial annulment of the extendable part of the Loans in view of error, \nbreach of duty of care and breach of information duties. The court hearing in this matter took place in September 2017. \nThe District Court of Amsterdam is expected to announce its verdict in the first half of 2019.\n\n \xc3\x85 On 22 August 2016, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO received a writ of summons from the indirect shareholders of its\xc2\xa0former clients, \n\nthe\xc2\xa0Partner Logistics Group. The claimants alleged that the defendants, including ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO, had\xc2\xa0acted wrongfully \nin relation to the bankruptcy of the Partner Logistics Group. Based on this, they claimed damages of EUR\xc2\xa0205\xc2\xa0million. \nAfter all their\xc2\xa0claims were rejected on 28 October 2018, the claimants filed for appeal in late January 2019.\n\n \xc3\x85 Other contingencies include\xc2\xa0EUR\xc2\xa056\xc2\xa0million related to an irrevocable payment commitment (IPC) to the Single \n\nResolution Board (SRB) in Brussels. In April 2016, the SRB provided credit institutions with the option to fulfil part of \ntheir obligation to pay the annual ex-ante contributions to the Single Resolution Fund (SRF) through IPCs. To secure \nfull and punctual payment, when called by the SRB, credit institutions needed to constitute cash collateral and fully \ntransfer legal\xc2\xa0ownership to the SRB.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadershipGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceOtherAnnual Financial Statements\x0cAnnual Financial Statements 2018  /  Notes to the Consolidated Annual\xc2\xa0Financial\xc2\xa0Statements\n\n246\n\nDuty of care matters\nA number of proceedings have been initiated against ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO for alleged breach of its duty of care in transparency-\nrelated standards. Where applicable, provisions for these matters have been made.\n\nThere can be no assurance that additional proceedings will not be brought or that amounts demanded in claims brought \nto date will not rise. Current proceedings are pending and their outcome, as well as the outcome of any threatened \nproceedings, is uncertain, as is the timing of reaching any finality on these legal claims and proceedings. These \nuncertainties are likely to continue for some time. As a result, and although the consequences could be substantial \nfor\xc2\xa0ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO and have a potentially material adverse effect on ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s reputation, results of operations, \nfinancial\xc2\xa0condition and prospects, it is not possible to reliably estimate or quantify ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s exposure at this time.\n\nInterest rate derivatives sold\xc2\xa0to SME clients\nA public debate has been ongoing in the Netherlands since 2014 on a bank\xe2\x80\x99s duty of care towards SMEs with respect \nto\xc2\xa0interest rate derivatives. \n\xc2\xa0 \nAs explained in note 29 Provisions, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO entered into interest rate derivatives, in combination with floating \ninterest rate loans, with approximately 6,800 SME clients. These clients entered into an interest rate derivative with \nthe\xc2\xa0purpose of fixing the interest rate risk on their floating rate loans. A combination of a floating interest rate loan \nand\xc2\xa0an interest rate swap was less expensive for these clients than the alternative of a loan with a fixed interest rate. \nAs\xc2\xa0a\xc2\xa0result of the decline in interest rates, the interest rate swaps currently have a negative mark-to-market value. There \nare no negative consequences for clients as long as the loan is not repaid, in whole or in part, before its maturity date.\n\nIndividual or class action complaints and litigation\nSome SME clients needed or wanted to repay their floating interest rate loans before their maturity date. As a consequence, \nthe interest rate swap needed to be unwound in order to avoid creating an overhedge. In line with standard market practice \nin such situations, the SME clients had to pay the bank the negative mark-to-market value of the interest rate swap. Such \npayments may be compared to the penalty interest on a fixed rate loan. ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO received multiple complaints and some \nclients and/or interest groups instigated legal proceedings about the bank\xe2\x80\x99s alleged violation of its duty of care, claiming, \nfor instance, that the bank had not properly informed them of the risks associated with interest rate swaps. In most \nof\xc2\xa0these cases, the client\xe2\x80\x99s claim was rejected, while in some other cases the bank paid compensation to the client. \n \nIn the case of litigation relating to SME derivatives, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO does not recognise provisions for claims that do not \nmeet the recognition and/or measurement criteria. There can be no assurance that additional proceedings will not be \nbrought or that the amount demanded in claims brought to date will not rise. Current proceedings are pending and their \noutcome is uncertain. These uncertainties are likely to continue for some time. \n\nUniform Recovery Framework\nIn December 2015 the AFM concluded that some aspects of the reviews banks were conducting with respect to their \nSME client files containing interest rate derivatives would need to be amended. On 1 March 2016, the AFM published \na\xc2\xa0press release and a letter addressed to the Dutch Minister of Finance, advising him to appoint a panel of independent \nexperts to advise on the reassessment of SME and middle-market interest rate derivatives. The draft Uniform Recovery \nFramework prepared by this panel of independent experts was presented on 5 July 2016.\xc2\xa0ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO has committed \nto\xc2\xa0the Uniform Recovery Framework, which was finalised on 19 December 2016.\xc2\xa0It is currently unclear how the Uniform \nRecovery Framework will impact on pending and future litigation. \n \nAs this is a possible liability dependent on a future event, no provision for a possible outflow of resources has been \nmade and it is therefore considered a contingency. Reference is made in this respect to note 29 Provisions.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership structureGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceOtherAnnual Financial Statements\x0cAnnual Financial Statements 2018  /  Notes to the Consolidated Annual\xc2\xa0Financial\xc2\xa0Statements\n\n247\n\nCross-liability\nA legal demerger may give rise to \xe2\x80\x98cross-liabilities\xe2\x80\x99. Under Section 2:334t of the Dutch Civil Code, the acquiring company \nor companies and the demerging company, if it continues to exist, are jointly and severally liable for the obligations of \nthe demerging company at the time of the demerger. The acquiring companies and the continuing demerged company \nwill remain fully liable for indivisible obligations. In the case of divisible obligations (e.g. monetary obligations), the \nacquiring company to whom the obligation transferred or, if the obligation remained where it was, the company that \ncontinued to exist is fully liable. However, if an obligation has not been transferred to a company or if it remained with \na\xc2\xa0company, that company\xe2\x80\x99s liability for divisible obligations will be limited to the value of the assets acquired or retained \nin the demerger. A cross-liability is of a secondary nature. The company that did not acquire or retain the obligation is \nnot\xc2\xa0required to perform until the company that acquired or retained the obligation fails to perform. \n \nOn 6 February 2010, the former ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Bank N.V. demerged into two entities: RBS N.V. and ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Bank N.V. \n(the \xe2\x80\x982010 Demerger\xe2\x80\x99), giving rise to cross-liabilities similar to the cross-liabilities described above. If ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Bank N.V.  \nfails to perform its obligations existing at the time of the 2010 Demerger, RBS N.V. is liable for the performance; if RBS N.V.  \nfails to perform its obligations existing at the time of the 2010 Demerger, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Bank N.V. is liable. RBS\xc2\xa0N.V.\xe2\x80\x99s \ncontingent liability for divisible obligations as a result of the 2010 Demerger is limited to EUR\xc2\xa04.0\xc2\xa0billion, whereas \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Bank N.V.\xe2\x80\x99s contingent liability is limited to EUR\xc2\xa01.8\xc2\xa0billion (which amount remained unchanged compared \nto\xc2\xa031 December 2017). ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Bank N.V. has put in place arrangements to mitigate the risks of such contingent \nliability and received collateral from RBS Plc amounting to EUR\xc2\xa01.8\xc2\xa0billion (2017: EUR\xc2\xa01.8\xc2\xa0billion). ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Bank N.V. \ndid not post any collateral with RBS N.V. or RBS Plc. \n \nOn 7 August 2008, the EC Remedy part of ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Bank N.V. was demerged to New HBU II N.V. (the \xe2\x80\x982008 \nDemerger\xe2\x80\x99), giving rise to cross-liabilities similar to the cross-liabilities as described above. If ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Bank N.V. fails \nto perform its obligations existing at the date of the 2008 Demerger, New HBU II N.V. is liable for the performance; if \nNew HBU II N.V. fails to perform its obligations existing at the date of the 2008 Demerger, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Bank N.V. is liable. \n \nOn 1 April 2010, New HBU II N.V. was transferred to Deutsche Bank AG and renamed Deutsche Bank Nederland N.V. \nAs\xc2\xa0a result of the cross-liabilities described above, if RBS N.V. or ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Bank N.V. fails to perform its obligations \nexisting at the date of the 2008 Demerger, Deutsche Bank Nederland N.V. is liable for the performance. Deutsche Bank \nNederland N.V.\xe2\x80\x99s contingent liability in this regard is limited to EUR\xc2\xa0950\xc2\xa0million. On 27 September 2014, pursuant to a put \noption exercised by Deutsche Bank AG, the assets and liabilities of Deutsche Bank Nederland N.V., apart from the cross-\nliabilities created as a result of the 2008 Demerger, were demerged into a newly incorporated subsidiary of Deutsche \nBank AG (the \xe2\x80\x982014 Demerger\xe2\x80\x99). Deutsche Bank Nederland N.V. was subsequently acquired by ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Bank N.V. \nand renamed Sumsare N.V. As a consequence, Deutsche Bank Nederland N.V.\xe2\x80\x99s contingent liability under the 2008 \nDemerger is now held by Sumsare N.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO Bank N.V. Deutsche Bank AG \nindemnified Sumsare N.V. for any claims (including cross-liabilities) in connection with the 2014 Demerger.\n\nIndemnity agreement with the Dutch State\xc2\xa0\nOn 1 April 2010 ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO signed an indemnity agreement with the Dutch State (currently represented by NLFI) \nfor\xc2\xa0a\xc2\xa0shortfall in capital above a certain amount related to specific assets and liabilities of RFS Holdings B.V. In July 2015 \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO was informed by NLFI of a claim it had received from RBS relating to these assets and liabilities in \nRFS\xc2\xa0Holdings B.V. This gives NLFI the right to file a claim with ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO. As at the publication date of these Annual \nFinancial Statements, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO is not aware of any claim being filed by NLFI. This situation could change in the future. \n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadershipGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceOtherAnnual Financial Statements\x0cAnnual Financial Statements 2018  /  Notes to the Consolidated Annual\xc2\xa0Financial\xc2\xa0Statements\n\n248\n\n35  Remuneration of Executive Board and\xc2\xa0Supervisory\xc2\xa0Board\nRemuneration of Executive Board and former Managing Board\nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s remuneration policy was formally approved by shareholders and adopted by the Supervisory Board. \n\nIn 2017, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO changed its management structure.

(ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xc2\xa0Bank) and ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xc2\xa0Group\xc2\xa0N.V. (ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xc2\xa0Group). As a result of the \nproposed merger, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xc2\xa0Group will cease to exist. Shareholders in ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xc2\xa0Group will consequently become \nshareholders in ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xc2\xa0Bank, while shares in ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xc2\xa0Bank will be represented by depositary receipts, through \nwhich\xc2\xa0the listing on Euronext Amsterdam will be retained. Holders of debt instruments will continue to hold instruments \nissued by ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xc2\xa0Bank. The legal merger has no material effect on equity. A legal merger is subject to approval by \ndepositary receipt holders, shareholders and regulators, including DNB and ECB. Subject to all the necessary approvals, \nincluding regulatory approvals, the merger is expected to be executed during 2019.\n\nOn 28 February, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO acquired 100% of the shares in Soci\xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9 G\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa9rale Private Banking NV in Belgium.

By combining ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO\xe2\x80\x99s existing private banking activities in Belgium with \nthose of Soci\xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9 G\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa9rale, ABN\xc2\xa0AMRO strengthens its market position in Belgium and its position in the Eurozone as a \nleading private bank.

In our \nplanning phase we have set the initial planning materiality at EUR 150 million. We reassessed the materiality based on \nthe 2018 operating profit before taxation and concluded the initial planning materiality to be appropriate for the purpose \nof the audit of the 2018 annual financial statements.\n\nWe have also taken into account misstatements and/or \npossible misstatements that in our opinion are material for \nthe users of the financial statements for qualitative \nreasons.\n\nWe agreed with the supervisory board that misstatements \nin excess of EUR 7.5 million, which are identified during \nthe audit, would be reported to them, as well as smaller \nmisstatements that in our view must be reported on \nqualitative grounds.\n\nScope of the group audit\nABN AMRO Group N.V. is at the head of a group of entities. \nThe financial information of this group is included in the \nconsolidated financial statements of ABN AMRO Group N.V. \n\nOur group audit mainly focused on significant group entities \nin France, Germany, the Netherlands and the United States \nbased on size and risk. We have performed full scope audit \nprocedures, specific scope audit procedures or review \nscope audit procedures at those entities. We were \nresponsible for the scope and direction of the audit \nprocedures and issued group instructions to all \ncomponents teams in scope. On a regular basis, we \ninteracted with the component teams during the various \nstages of the audit. Based on our risk assessment, we \nvisited component locations in France, Germany and the \nUnited States. We reviewed local working papers and \nconclusions and met with local management.\n\nIn total, the procedures above for entities in scope \ncover\xc2\xa0approximately 91% of the group\xe2\x80\x99s total assets and \napproximately 93% of operating profit before taxation, \nof\xc2\xa0which 87% respectively 82% for full scope entities. \nFor\xc2\xa0the\xc2\xa0remaining components we performed, amongst \nother procedures, analytical procedures to corroborate our \nassessment that there were no significant risks of material \nmisstatements within these components. All entities in \nscope for group reporting are audited by EY.\n\nBy performing the procedures mentioned above at group \nentities, together with additional procedures at group level, \nwe have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit \nevidence about the group\xe2\x80\x99s financial information to provide \nan opinion about the consolidated financial statements. \n\nOur key audit matters\nKey audit matters are those matters that, in our \nprofessional judgment, were of most significance in our \naudit of the financial statements. We have communicated \nthe key audit matters to the supervisory board. The key \naudit matters are not a comprehensive reflection of all \nmatters discussed. \n\nThese matters were addressed in the context of our audit \nof the financial statements as a whole and in forming our \nopinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion \non these matters.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadershipGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceAnnual Financial StatementsOther\x0cOther  /  Independent auditor\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0report\n\n260\n\nEstimation uncertainty with respect to impairment allowances for loans and receivables \xe2\x80\x93 customers\n\nRisk\n\nABN AMRO adopted IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (hereafter: IFRS 9) as at 1 January 2018 and has applied the principles of IFRS 9 \nretrospectively from 1 January 2018 onwards. The total net impact on equity as at 1 January 2018 amounts to EUR 319 million lower \ncarrying value, of which EUR 166 million relates to classification and measurement and EUR 153 million relates to impairments. \n\nAt 31 December 2018, the impairment allowance for loans and advances customers amounts to EUR 2.3 billion. Impairment allowances \nrepresent the bank\xe2\x80\x99s best estimate of expected credit losses on the loans and advances customers at balance sheet date. They are \ncalculated based on the risk of default over different time horizons, depending on whether the credit risk of the borrower has increased \nsignificantly since the exposure was first recognized. The loss allowance for those exposures that have not increased significantly in \ncredit risk (\xe2\x80\x9cstage 1\xe2\x80\x9d exposures) is based on 12-month expected credit losses (ECLs). The allowance for those exposures that have \nsuffered a significant increase in credit risk (\xe2\x80\x9cstage 2\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cstage 3\xe2\x80\x9d exposures) is based on lifetime ECLs. The ECL of stage 1 loan \nportfolios, stage 2 loan portfolios and stage 3 loan portfolios of a similar nature and below a certain threshold are calculated collectively. \nThe remaining stage 3 loan portfolios are calculated individually.\n\nECL calculations are probability-weighted estimates of the present value of cash shortfalls using models, applying scenarios, and which \napproximate the impact of historical losses on the one hand and forward-looking developments on the other hand. There is a large \nincrease in data inputs required for these models that have not been used previously for the preparation of accounting records, which \nincreases the risk of data inaccuracy and data incompleteness. The inputs to these models are amongst others based on historical loss \nexperience, macroeconomic variables, credit conditions of the loan and cash flow projections with judgment applied to determine the \nassumptions used to calculate the loan impairment allowance. Proxies and overlays are applied where data driven parameters or \ncalculations are not considered representative of the risk or conditions of the portfolio. \n\nThe bank\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of significant increase in credit risk, correct stage classification and the determination of the loan impairment \nallowance is part of the risk estimation process, and requires significant management judgment. As the loans and advances customers \nand the associated loan impairment allowance are material to the bank\xe2\x80\x99s balance sheet and income statement and given the related \nestimation uncertainty on loan impairment allowances, we consider this a key audit matter.\n\nThe critical accounting estimates and judgments and loan impairment allowance amounts are disclosed in note 1 Accounting policies \nand\xc2\xa0note 20 Loans and advances customers to the annual financial statements. Related accounting policies and credit risk disclosures \nare\xc2\xa0included in the Risk, Funding and Capital section of the executive board report.\n\nOur audit \napproach\n\nAs ABN AMRO adopted IFRS 9 Financial Instruments as at 1 January 2018, we performed audit procedures on the opening balances to \ngain assurance on the transition from IAS 39. This included evaluating the accounting interpretations for compliance with IFRS 9 and \ntesting the adjustments and disclosures made on the transition.\n\nFor the year-end loan impairment allowance, we have obtained an understanding of the loan origination process, the credit risk \nmanagement process and the estimation process of determining impairment allowances for loans and advances customers, and tested \nthe operating effectiveness of controls within these processes. Furthermore, we performed substantive and analytical procedures over \ndata, models, impairment calculation and overlays.\n\nFor collectively assessed loan impairment allowances, using models, we involved our modelling specialists to assess the modelling \nmethodology, challenge the underlying assumptions and to independently reperform the calculation for material portfolios. The \nappropriateness of the bank\xe2\x80\x99s judgments was also assessed in respect of inputs and judgmental overlays. For macroeconomic variables, \nwe compared data and assumptions used to external benchmarks, with the support of our internal specialists. To verify data quality, \nwe\xc2\xa0tested the data used in the calculation by reconciling to source systems.\n\nOn a risk basis, we selected individual loans and performed detailed credit file reviews and assessed whether the bank correctly applied \nits credit risk policy. \n\nIn addition, we challenged the bank\xe2\x80\x99s criteria used to allocate an asset to stage 1, 2 or 3 in accordance with IFRS 9, tested assets in stage \n1, 2 and 3 to verify that they were allocated to the appropriate stage, assessed the scenarios applied and recalculated the impairment \namounts recorded. For certain areas, assisted by our specialists, we assessed the assumptions, such as estimated future cash flows and \ncollateral valuations, underlying the loan impairment calculation. Calculations based on a discounted cash flow model within our sample \nwere re-performed.\n\nFinally, we assessed whether the disclosures are in compliance with EU-IFRS requirements.\n\nKey  \nobservations\n\nBased on our procedures performed we consider the impairment allowance for loans and advances customers to be reasonable.\n\nThe IFRS 9 transitional disclosure and the disclosures on loans and advances customers and loan impairment allowance are considered \nadequate and appropriate and meet the requirements under EU-IFRS.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership structureGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceAnnual Financial StatementsOther\x0cOther  /  Independent auditor\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0report\n\n261\n\nEstimation uncertainty with respect to provisions for conduct, regulatory matters and restructuring\n\nRisk\n\nAt 31 December 2018, the total provisions amount to EUR 1.2 billion of which an amount of EUR 475 million relates to legal provisions \ncovering conduct and regulatory matters. An amount of EUR 294 million is provided for restructuring. \n\nThe continued increased regulatory scrutiny gives rise to a high level of judgment in determining appropriate provisions and disclosures. \nABN AMRO has to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including those in relation to client acceptance and payment transactions. \nIncluded in the legal provisions are amongst others the provision for SME derivatives related issues amounting to EUR 275 million. As part \nof the other provisions of EUR 178 million, an amount of EUR 85 million is provided for in relation to the Know Your Client (KYC) and \ntransaction monitoring remediation programs.\n\nThe restructuring provision is recorded for programs that are planned and controlled by the bank due to material changes in the scope \nof\xc2\xa0certain business segments or the manner in which that business is conducted. \n\nThese provisions are liabilities of uncertain timing or amount and require considerable judgment of the bank. Due to this high level \nof\xc2\xa0judgment and the significant amounts involved, we consider this a key audit matter. \n\nThe critical accounting estimates and judgments and provision amounts are disclosed in note 1 Accounting policies and note 29 Provisions.\n\nOur audit \napproach\n\nFor the provisions recognized we assessed whether these provisions are reasonable and meet the bank\xe2\x80\x99s accounting policies and other \nlegal and regulatory requirements. We challenged the underlying assumptions and tested the data used.\n\nWe have obtained an understanding of the entity level controls and the legal and regulatory framework of the bank. On a regular basis, \nwe inquired with the Legal department and Compliance department of the bank to understand and discuss existing and potentially new \nconstructive and legal obligations, and regulatory matters. \n\nWe examined the relevant regulatory and legal correspondence to assess developments in regulatory findings and observations. \nWe\xc2\xa0periodically met with the executive board members to understand the significant and potential obligations and challenged their views \nbased on our audit procedures performed, knowledge of the bank and changes in the regulatory environment. We read the minutes of the \nexecutive board and supervisory board and attended the risk and capital committee meetings throughout the year. In addition, we held \nregular bilateral meetings with the chairs of the supervisory board, audit committee and risk and capital committee. Furthermore, we \nobtained legal letters from external lawyers to understand regulatory and legal matters.  \nIn line with auditing standard 250, we performed an analysis of the shortcomings as identified by the Dutch Central Bank in the KYC \nprocess and transaction monitoring process and the remediation thereon. We examined the level of provisioning, performed test of details \nand assessed the assumptions and judgments made by the bank. Especially in the area of being compliant to the Anti-Money Laundering \nand Counter Terrorism Financing Act, we involved our internal specialists. Possible outcomes were considered by\xc2\xa0us for material \nprovisions to independently assess the reasonableness of the judgment applied by the bank. \n\nFinally, we assessed the completeness and accuracy of the disclosures related to provisions and whether these disclosures are in \ncompliance with EU-IFRS requirements.\n\nKey  \nobservations\n\nBased on our procedures performed we consider the provisions to be reasonable.\n\nThe disclosure on provisions is considered adequate and appropriate and meets the requirements under EU-IFRS. \n\nReliability and continuity of electronic data processing\n\nRisk\n\nThe bank is highly dependent on the reliability and the continuity of electronic data processing due to the significant number of transactions \nthat are processed daily. External reporting and the increased granularity of financial and non-financial data are also important to \nstakeholders. An adequate IT infrastructure ensures the reliability and continuity of the bank\xe2\x80\x99s business processes and financial reporting. \nThe bank continuously makes investments to further improve the IT environment and IT systems. The audit approach relies on automated \ncontrols and therefore on the effectiveness of controls over IT systems. We identified and reported that access management controls for \ncertain applications in the financial reporting process requires improvement. The bank implemented several remediation activities to \nreduce the risk over access management in the financial reporting process. As the reliability and continuity of the IT systems may have an \nimpact on automated data processing, and due to the pervasive nature of IT general controls, we consider this a key audit matter.\n\nA summary of technology and the IT environment is included in the Non-financial review section in the executive board report.\n\nOur audit \napproach\n\nIT general controls related to access management and change management and  application controls were tested over automated data \nprocessing systems, operating systems and data bases, where we relied upon for financial reporting. \n\nIn some areas we performed additional procedures on access management for the related systems. \n\nWe also assessed the reliability and continuity of the IT environment and the possible impact of changes during the year either from \nongoing internal restructuring initiatives or to meet external reporting requirements. In addition, our audit procedures consisted of \nassessing the developments in the IT infrastructure and analyzing the impact on the IT organization. We assessed the reliability and \ncontinuity of automated data processing only to the extent necessary within the scope of the audit of the annual financial statements.\n\nKey  \nobservations\n\nFor the audit of the annual financial statements we found the reliability and continuity of the automated data processing \nsystems\xc2\xa0adequate.\n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadershipGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceAnnual Financial StatementsOther\x0cOther  /  Independent auditor\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0report\n\n262\n\nIn the 2017 auditor\xe2\x80\x99s report, \xe2\x80\x9csuspense accounts\xe2\x80\x9d was \nidentified as key audit matter.

Based on our \nknowledge and understanding obtained through our \naudit\xc2\xa0of the financial statements or otherwise, we have \nconsidered whether the other information contains \nmaterial misstatements. By performing these procedures, \nwe comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 2 of \nthe Dutch Civil Code and the Dutch Standard 720. The \nscope of the procedures performed is substantially less \nthan the scope of those performed in our audit of the \nfinancial statements.\n\nManagement is responsible for the preparation of the \nother information, including the executive board\xe2\x80\x99s report in \naccordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code \nand other information required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the \nDutch Civil Code.\n\nReport on other legal and regulatory requirements\nEngagement\nWe were engaged by the supervisory board as auditor of \nABN AMRO Group N.V. on 11 September 2015, as of the \naudit for the year 2016 and have operated as statutory \nauditor since that date.\n\nNo prohibited non-audit services \nWe have not provided prohibited non-audit services as \nreferred to in Article 5(1) of the EU Regulation on specific \nrequirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest \nentities, with one exception. \nDuring 2018, an EY tax team in the Netherlands, not \ninvolved in the audit of the financial statements 2018, \nconducted a non-audit services engagement at the \nrequest of, and for, a small entity newly acquired by \nABN\xc2\xa0AMRO. The contractual fee was less than 0.06% \n\nof\xc2\xa0EY\xe2\x80\x99s audit fees for the consolidated financial statements \n2018. As these non-audit services are non-permissible \nunder the Dutch independence rules, we immediately \nterminated this engagement upon identification and \nconsulted with the audit committee and reported the \nincident to the Dutch regulator. Due to the nature and \nlimited size of the engagement we concluded that our \nindependence was not compromised, to which the \naudit committee agreed with and the Dutch regulator \nhas\xc2\xa0not objected.\n\nDescription of responsibilities  \nfor the financial statements\nResponsibilities of management and the supervisory \nboard for the financial statements \nManagement is responsible for the preparation and fair \npresentation of the financial statements in accordance with \nEU-IFRS and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code. \nFurthermore, management is responsible for such internal \ncontrol as management determines is necessary to enable \nthe preparation of the financial statements that are free \nfrom material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\nAs part of the preparation of the financial statements, \nmanagement is responsible for assessing the company\xe2\x80\x99s \nability to continue as a going concern. Based on the \nfinancial reporting frameworks mentioned, management \nshould prepare the financial statements using the going \nconcern basis of accounting unless management either \nintends to liquidate the company or to cease operations, \nor\xc2\xa0has no realistic alternative but to do so. Management \nshould disclose events and circumstances that may cast \nsignificant doubt on the company\xe2\x80\x99s ability to continue as \na\xc2\xa0going concern in the financial statements. \n\nThe supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the \ncompany\xe2\x80\x99s financial reporting process.\n\nOur responsibilities for the audit of the financial \nstatements\nOur objective is to plan and perform the audit engagement \nin a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and \nappropriate audit evidence for our opinion. \n\nOur audit has been performed with a high, but not \nabsolute, level of assurance, which means we may not \ndetect all material errors and fraud during our audit. \n\nMisstatements can arise from fraud or error and are \nconsidered material if, individually or in the aggregate, \nthey could reasonably be expected to influence the \neconomic decisions of users taken on the basis of these \nfinancial statements. The materiality affects the nature, \ntiming and extent of our audit procedures and the \nevaluation of the effect of identified misstatements \non\xc2\xa0our\xc2\xa0opinion. \n\nABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018IntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership structureGovernanceAnnual Financial StatementsOtherIntroductionStrategy and performanceRisk, funding & capitalLeadership & governanceAnnual Financial StatementsOther\x0cOther  /  Independent auditor\xe2\x80\x99s\xc2\xa0report\n\n263\n\nWe have exercised professional judgment and have \nmaintained professional skepticism throughout the audit, \nin accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical \nrequirements and independence requirements. Our audit \nincluded among others: \n \xc3\x85 Identifying and assessing the risks of material \n\nmisstatement of the financial statements, whether \ndue to fraud or error, designing and performing audit \nprocedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining \naudit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to \nprovide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting \na material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher \nthan for one resulting from error, \n\n \xc3\x85 as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional \nomissions, misrepresentations, or the override of \ninternal control\n\n \xc3\x85 Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant \n\nto the audit in order to design audit procedures that \nare appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the \npurpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness \nof the company\xe2\x80\x99s internal control\n\n \xc3\x85 Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies \nused and the reasonableness of accounting estimates \nand related disclosures made by management\n\n \xc3\x85 Concluding on the appropriateness of management\xe2\x80\x99s \n\nuse of the going concern basis of accounting, and \nbased on the audit evidence obtained, whether \na material uncertainty exists related to events or \nconditions that may cast significant doubt on the \ncompany\xe2\x80\x99s ability to continue as a going concern. \n\n \xc3\x85 If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we \nare required to draw attention in our auditor\xe2\x80\x99s report \nto\xc2\xa0the related disclosures in the financial statements \nor,\xc2\xa0if such disclosures are inadequate, \n\n \xc3\x85 to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based \n\non the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our \nauditor\xe2\x80\x99s report. However, future events or conditions \nmay cause a company to cease to continue as a going \nconcern\n\n \xc3\x85 Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and \ncontent of the financial statements, including the \ndisclosures\n\n \xc3\x85 Evaluating whether the financial statements represent \nthe underlying transactions and events in a manner that \nachieves fair presentation\n\nBecause we are ultimately responsible for the opinion, \nwe\xc2\xa0are also responsible for directing, supervising and \nperforming the group audit. In this respect we have \ndetermined the nature and extent of the audit procedures \nto be carried out for group entities. Decisive were the size \nand/or the risk profile of the group entities or operations. \nOn this basis, we selected group entities for which an \naudit or review had to be carried out on the complete \nset\xc2\xa0of financial information or specific items.\n\nWe communicate with the supervisory board regarding, \namong other matters, the planned scope and timing of \nthe\xc2\xa0audit and significant audit findings, including any \nsignificant findings in internal control that we identify \nduring our audit. In this respect we also submit an \nadditional report to the audit committee in accordance \nwith Article 11 of the EU Regulation on specific \nrequirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest \nentities. The information included in this additional report \nis consistent with our audit opinion in this auditor\xe2\x80\x99s report.\n\nWe provide the supervisory board with a statement that \nwe have complied with relevant ethical requirements \nregarding independence, and to communicate with them \nall relationships and other matters that may reasonably \nbe\xc2\xa0thought to bear on our independence, and where \napplicable, related safeguards.\n\nFrom the matters communicated with the supervisory \nboard, we determine the key audit matters: those matters \nthat were of most significance in the audit of the financial \nstatements. We describe these matters in\xc2\xa0our auditor\xe2\x80\x99s \nreport unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure \nabout the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, \nnot communicating the matter is in the public interest.\n\nAmsterdam, 12 March 2019\n\nErnst & Young Accountants LLP\nsigned by W.J.
