We now offer \n\ncore business and new initiatives. I am pleased to share that \n\ncommercial grade Chrome OS products which are more rug-\n\nour efforts and achievements in 2018 concluded with growth \n\ngedized  in  design  and  built  very  differently  from  consumer \n\nin  both  revenue  and  profitability.  Acer\'s  2018  consolidated \n\ndevices. \n\nrevenues reached NT$242.27 billion with 2.1 percent growth \n\nyear-over-year; Net income reached NT$3.06 billion, up 8.7 \n\npercent  year-over-year;  and  earnings  per  share  (EPS)  were \n\nNT$1.01, the highest in eight years.  \n\nAcer\'s participation in esports games has been action-packed. \n\nWe were the official monitor provider of the 2018 League of \n\nLegends World Championships. In the third quarter, we kicked \n\noff our second Asia Pacific Predator league tournament where \n\nWhile  Acer\'s  gaming  business  achieved  substantial  revenue \n\n3,530 teams competed over five months and battled for the \n\ngrowth, in the latter part of the year, our operations were im-\n\nleague championship. Through such events, Acer will engage \n\npacted  by  global  CPU  supply  shortages  for  PCs.  Meanwhile, \n\nnew audiences while continuing to bring technologies, inno-\n\nwe  are  excited  to  see  other  products  and  businesses  show-\n\nvations and game-changing designs first to market.\n\ning growth, such as AOPEN, Weblink International, Acer Cyber \n\nSecurity,  digital  displays  and  gadgets.  We  will  continue  the \n\npursuit of technological innovation and leading-edge design, \n\nbroaden  our  business  boundaries  from  PCs  to  new  markets, \n\nand create multiple growth engines. \n\nFor  AI-based  technology,  servers  by  our  subsidiary,  Altos \n\nComputing,  which  integrate  other  software  and  services  to \n\nprovide a variety of solutions have won a dozen major high-\n\nperformance computing (HPC) tenders globally in 2018. In the \n\nrealm of smart cities, Acer ITS successfully initiated Taiwan\'s \n\nUnderscoring  the  importance we  place  on  research  and  de-\n\nfirst roadside Smart Parking Meter BOT project in collabora-\n\nvelopment, in 2018 Acer ranked among the top three in the \n\ntion  with  the  Tainan  city  government,  with  parking  meters \n\nnumber  of  Taiwan  patent  applications  with  476  filings,  up \n\nimplemented along a total of 2,000 spaces across the city.\n\n25 percent from the previous year. Among these patents, we \n\nhave innovative and breakthrough technologies such as our \n\nadvanced thermal solutions that enable Acer products to run \n\nat peak performance without overheating; these include our \n\nAeroBlade 3D metal fans applied in gaming notebooks, and \n\nIceTunnel  cooling  system  for  gaming  desktops.  Acer\'s  thin-\n\nand-light notebooks, gaming and education lines all captured \n\nattention with multiple industry and media awards. Further-\n\nmore, we are innovating in other aspects of designs that com-\n\nplete  the  total  user  experience,  such  as  software  and  pack-\n\naging, which were  recognized  and  awarded  by  the  iF  Design \n\nAwards of Germany. \n\nIn  the  Chrome  OS  segment,  Acer  ranked  No.  1  for  Chrome-\n\nbooks worldwide  in  Q4  2018 with  31  percent  market  share. \n\nWe offer the most complete selection of screen sizes and form \n\nfactors for a variety of usage needs. Acer is also strengthen-\n\nVenturing into technology for the future, Acer\'s Value Lab has \n\ncollaborated  with  one  of  Taiwan\'s  top  automakers,  Luxgen, \n\nto  showcase  the  vision  of  artificial  intelligence  (AI)  and  au-\n\ntonomous driving technology with a level 4-ready self-driving \n\nconcept car. Acer is stepping up the development further by \n\ncooperating  with  the  National  Yang-Ming  University  School \n\nof Medicine to improve the passenger experience, where the \n\nphysiological state of passengers during the technology de-\n\nvelopment  stage  is  monitored  to  improve  comfortability  of \n\nthe ride even during unexpected situations. On top of these, \n\nthere are many other exciting initiatives being developed.\n\nFor long-term business sustainability, Acer\'s pursuit to make \n\na positive impact to our society and environment has made \n\nsignificant headway in 2018. In addition to the on-going en-\n\ngagement with our partners and suppliers to act responsibly, \n\n50 percent of electricity consumption from Acer\'s global op-\n\nAcer Incorporated 2018 Annual ReportBusiness ReportAcer Incorporated 2018 Annual ReportBusiness Report\x0c6\n\n7\n\nerations  comes  from  green  energy. We  also  initiated  several \n\nprograms to encourage global employees to take part in car-\n\ning for our environment. With sustainable development em-\n\nbedded  in  the  company  culture,  and  the  determination  to \n\ninnovate  in  all  aspects  of  our  technology,  management  and \n\noperations, we persist in giving back to our communities and \n\nexceling in our corporate social responsibilities (CSR). More-\n\nover, to put into clearer perspective of Acer\'s impact on the \n\nenvironment  and  society,  we  continued  to  adopt  the  True \n\nValue methodology that quantifies in financial terms the costs \n\nand benefits. This serves as a guidance on taking the relevant \n\nrisk control measures and weighing business opportunities. \n\nWe have made significant strides in the past year, and we are \n\nalready moving full-steam ahead to explore and conquer new \n\nchallenges. On behalf of all Acer employees, allow me to ex-\n\npress  our  deepest  appreciation  to  our  shareholders  for your \n\nsupport. I look forward to planting the seeds for new opportu-\n\nnities in another fruitful year together!\n\nSincerely,\n\nJason Chen\n\nChairman and CEO\n\n1.1 Acer\'s Core Values\n\nAcer continues its transformation to become a \xe2\x80\x9chardware + software + services\xe2\x80\x9d company.

Policy, Standard and Combination of the Remuneration\n\nThe directors\' remuneration of the Company is based on the provisions of the Company\'s Articles of Incorporation; in accor-\ndance with the directors\' participation in the company\'s operations and the value of their contributions. The Remuneration \nCommittee refers to the standard of peers in the same industry and submits to the Board of Directors for resolution and issue \npayment after passing the resolution, and reports to the shareholders during the annual meeting in accordance with the law. \nThe remuneration of the directors includes fixed remuneration, reward of directors, and business execution expenses (travel \nexpenses included). When the company makes profit that year, the profit less an amount reserved to make up for the accumu-\nlative losses and no more than 0.8% of that balance is allocated to the directors as the reward. Regardless of fixed remunera-\ntion, business execution expenses and reward of directors, they are subject to the standards of the high-tech industry and \nare submitted by the Remuneration Committee to the Board of Directors for resolution and issue payment after passing the \nresolution.\n\nIn addition, according to the principle of remuneration paid by the company\'s remuneration committee and the board of \ndirectors, the director concurrently served as an employee would not be awarded with other director\'s remuneration (i.e. fixed \nremuneration and reward of directors) except for the business execution expenses.\n\nThe combination of Director\'s remuneration of 2018 is as follows:\n\n6%\n\nBusiness execution \nexpense\n\nReward of directors\n\n30%\n\nFixed Remuneration\n\n64%\n\n2.

The method of allocation is submitted by the Remuneration Committee to the \nboard of directors to decide.\n\n3. The relevance of the business performance and the future risks\n\nThe directors\' remuneration is stipulated in the company\'s Articles of Incorporation, and the non-fixed remuneration part is \nbased on the company\'s annual profitability and is directly related to the company\'s operating performance. In addition, consid-\nering the directors\' responsibilities, the company\'s operating performance and the standard of the peers in the same industry, \nfixed remuneration is set to avoid the negligence in assessing the future risks resulting from pursuing short-term operation \nprofits.

Policy, Standard and Combination of the Remuneration\n\nThe remuneration of the company to the manager is mainly divided into fixed salary, variable bonus and retire/severance pay; \nfixed salary is the monthly salary agreed with the employee, and the variable bonus is further divided into short-term bonus and \nlong-term bonus.\n\nShort-term bonuses are awarded when the annual performance has reached the target and in accordance with the Article 20 of \nthe Company\'s Articles of Incorporation. The short-term bonus considers the performance and contribution in the current year. \nThe remuneration committee will consider the factors such as the responsibilities of the job, the overall market of the industry \nand the market standard, report to the board of directors for approval. Upon approval, the annual bonus of the company will be \nreleased according to the times and date announced.\n\nThe long-term bonus is for the period of three years or more, and the profit of the shareholders\' investment in the company\'s \nstock is used as the standard for issuing the bonus which connects with the interests of the shareholders.\n\nVariable Bonus\n\n66%\n\nFixed Salary\n\n32%\n\n2%\n\nRetire/\nSeverance Pay\n\nAcer Incorporated 2018 Annual ReportCorporate Governance ReportAcer Incorporated 2018 Annual ReportCorporate Governance Report\x0c36\n\n37\n\n2.

The Company is fully aware that establishing, operating, and maintaining an internal control system are the responsibility of \nits Board of Directors and managers. The Company has established such a system aimed at providing reasonable assurance \nregarding the achievement of objectives in the following categories: (1) effectiveness and efficiency of operations (including \nprofitability, performance, and safe-guarding of assets), (2) reliability, timeliness, transparency, and regulatory compliance of \nreporting, and (3) compliance with applicable laws, regulations and bylaws.\n\n2.  An internal control system has inherent limitations. No matter how perfectly designed, an effective internal control system \ncan provide only reasonable assurance of accomplishing the three objectives mentioned above. Moreover, the effectiveness \nof an internal control system may be subject to changes of environment or circumstances. Nevertheless, the internal control \nsystem of the Company contains self-monitoring mechanisms, and the Company promptly takes corrective actions whenever \na deficiency is identified.\n\n3.  The Company evaluates the design and operating effectiveness of its internal control system based on the criteria provided \nin the \xe2\x80\x9cRegulations Governing Establishment of Internal Control Systems by Public Companies\xe2\x80\x9d promulgated by the Securi-\nties and Futures Bureau of the Financial Supervisory Commission (hereinafter, the \xe2\x80\x9cRegulations\xe2\x80\x9d). The criteria adopted by the \nRegulations identify five constituent elements of internal control based on the process of management control: (1) control en-\nvironment, (2) risk assessment, (3) control activities, (4) information and communications, and (5) monitoring activities. Each \nconstituent element further contains several items. Please refer to the Regulations for details.\n\n4.  The Company has evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of its internal control system according to the aforesaid \n\ncriteria.   \n\n5.  Based on the results of the evaluation mentioned in the preceding paragraph, the Company believes that, as of December 31, \n2018, its internal control system (including its supervision of subsidiaries), was effective in design and operation, and reason-\nably assured the achievement of the above-stated objectives.\n\n6.  This Statement will be an essential content of the Company\'s Annual Report for the year 2018 and Prospectus, and will be \npublicly disclosed. Any false-hood, concealment, or other illegality in the content made public will entail legal liability under \nArticles 20, 32, 171, and 174 of the Securities and Exchanged Act.\n\n7.

Market Share of PC Products\n\nAcer\'s 2018 revenue breakdown by regional operations were: Pan Asia Pacific with 38 percent share, EMEA with 35 percent share, \nand Pan America with 27 percent share. In worldwide PC shipments (Source: IDC), Acer ranked No. 4 for total PCs with 7 percent \nshare, No. 5 for notebooks with 8 percent share, and No. 4 for desktops with 4 percent share.\n\n2. The Future of Market Demand and Supply\n\nAccording to IDC, the growth of global PC shipments has officially reached saturation. However, the gradual development of 5G has \nbrought about the emergence of related IoT applications. In esports, its core development is based around the user experience and \nwhat is otherwise known as the "Gaming 3.0" era in Taiwan. In addition to hardware development, brand companies must embrace \nthose opportunities arising from the huge esports ecosystem with diversified business models and innovative applications.\n\nUnder this market condition, Acer will continue to focus on high-growth products, such as Chromebooks, thin-and-light note-\nbooks, and gaming PCs; in addition, the new brand \xe2\x80\x9cConceptD\xe2\x80\x9d launched in 2019 for "creators" is expected to inject fresh energy \ninto the overall stagnant PC industry. In 2018, Acer gaming products, Chromebooks, and among others, have reaped fruitful re-\nsults. Acer ranked No. 1 in worldwide gaming notebooks with 46 percent growth year-on-year (source: GFK and NPD, 2018), and \nNo. 1 worldwide for Chromebooks with 31 percent market share (source: IDC for Q4, 2018). In the year ahead, the company will \ncontinue to observe users\' needs and identify micro-trends that have the potential to create a new blue ocean of opportunities. \nIn parallel to focusing on its core PC products, Acer will persist in developing multiple growth engines, and integrate \xe2\x80\x9csoftware + \nhardware + services\xe2\x80\x9d to become a forward-looking company.\n\n3.

In new business developments, \nAcer has shifted away from traditional computer hardware manufacturers\' mindset. Its Value Lab has gradually invested more \nresources in developing artificial intelligence, big data and more, while exploring new business models to create opportunities for \ngrowth. Acer also has a number of subsidiaries in diverse scopes of business including information security, smart transportation, \nservers, digital signage solutions, and are just some examples of its multiple growth engines.\n\nIn terms of sales channel reach, Acer has a presence in over 160 countries and a lean organization for effective and fast decision \nmaking.

However, to \nfulfill its responsibilities as a corporate citizen, and to support global standards in strictly controlling the use of harmful environ-\nmental substances, the company released the \xe2\x80\x9cGuidelines for the Control of Restricted Substances\xe2\x80\x9d, which suppliers required to \nadhere to in the restriction of harmful substances including chemicals. Since July 1, 2006, all Acer products have complied with the \nEuropean Union\'s Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) and with the RoHS Recast to ban four types of phthalates. In addi-\ntion, the company\'s products are designed to reduce environmental impact from stages from design, packaging, transportation, \nusage, through to recycling for the goal of reducing harmful impacts on the environment. For example, in 2018, Acer achieved 100 \npercent use of recycled paper for its products, saving the earth\'s resources.\n\n5.1.3 Production Process of Key Products\n\nAcer has long-term cooperation with reputable firms, in and out of Taiwan, for the supply for raw materials. In addition, the com-\npany joined the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition in 1997, which later became the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA), \nand continues to be an active participant in the organization\'s actions. The company strictly prohibits suppliers from using com-\nponents and finished products produced with raw materials obtained illegally or via inhumane ways; or purchasing tantalum, tin, \ntungsten and gold (known as 3TG) from sources with direct or indirect funding or benefits from armed groups of the Congo or \nneighboring countries. Acer also updated the \xe2\x80\x9cResponsible Raw Materials Purchasing Policy\xe2\x80\x9d in 2017 by expanding the scope of \nmineral management beyond 3TG and Congo to ensure minerals management is consistent with the OECD\'s guidance for mineral \nsupply chains in conflict-affected and high-risk areas. The company requires suppliers to provide mineral procurement policies \nand processes, and shoulder the responsibility of social and environmental protection.\n\nSince 2016, the company has expanded its supplier responsibility management to the second-tier supplier (i.e. the supplier of sup-\npliers), and plans to expand to third-tier suppliers in 2021 to promote a positive cycle for sustainable future.\n\n5.1.4  Key Buyers and Suppliers Accounting Over 10% of Total \n\nNet Sales and Purchase:\n\n(1) Key Buyers for Acer Group: None\n\n(2) Key Suppliers for Acer Group\n\n2017\n\nItem\n\n1\n2\n3\n\nFrom\n\nAmount\n\nSupplier C\n\nSupplier D\n\nSupplier A\n\nOthers\n\n33,151,860\n\n20,318,907\n\n20,241,280\n\n91,421,223\n\nPercentage \nof total net \npurchase (%)\n\n20.08 \n\n12.30 \n\n12.26 \n\n55.36 \n\nInc.\nNone\n\nNone\n\nNone\n\n\xe3\x80\x80\n\nRelationship \n\nwith Acer \n\nFrom\n\nAmount\n\nUnit: NTD Thousands\n\n2018\n\nPercentage \nof total net \npurchase (%)\n\nRelationship \nwith Acer Inc.\n\nSupplier A\n\nSupplier C\n\nSupplier D\n\nOthers\n\n27,032,448\n\n26,096,605\n\n22,443,623\n\n85,303,623\n\n  16.81 \n\n16.22 \n\n13.95 \n\n53.02 \n\n100.00\n\nNone\n\nNone\n\nNone\n\n\xe3\x80\x80\n\nTotal Net Purchase\n\n165,133,270\n\n100.00 \n\nTotal Net Purchase\n\n160,876,299\n\nNote: The key suppliers are not significant change for 2018.\n\n5.1.5 Production Value in the Last Two Years: Not applicable.\n\n5.1.6 The Sales Value in the Last Two Years:\n\nYear                  \n\n2017\n\n2018\n\nMajor production \n\nDomestic Sales\n\nForeign Sales\n\nDomestic Sales\n\nForeign Sales\n\nComputer\n\nPeripherals & Others \n\nTotal            \n\n6,561,454\n\n18,511,502\n\n25,072,956\n\n178,477,796\n\n33,724,131\n\n212,201,927\n\n6,801,548\n\n24,090,391\n\n30,891,939\n\n176,159,653\n\n35,218,814\n\n211,378,467\n\nUnit: NTD Thousands\n\nAcer Incorporated 2018 Annual ReportAcer\xe2\x80\x99s Business FormulaAcer Incorporated 2018 Annual ReportAcer\xe2\x80\x99s Business Formula\x0c80\n\n81\n\n5.2 Keys to a Sustainable Future\n\n5.3 Employees\n\nEngaging in dual transformation for core IT business and new initiatives, Acer continues to pursue business growth and expansion, \nand upholds the following business philosophy and strategies:\n\n5.3.1 Global Human Asset Management\n\n5.2.1 Focus on competitive IT products with high margin in-\n\ncluding the gaming PC market\n\nCombining the strength and scale of its core products business with the innovation and integration capabilities of new businesses, \nAcer is transforming into a \xe2\x80\x9chardware + software + services\xe2\x80\x9d company.

In 2018, the Company was selected for the \nfifth consecutive year as a component stock of MSCI\'s Global Sustainability ESG Indexes and Dow Jones Sustainability Index (DJSI) \nEmerging Markets Index. Acer was included in the FTSE4Good Emerging Index for the third straight year, and listed in the new sub-\ncategory FTSE4Good TIP Taiwan ESG Index.\n\nIn 2008, Acer stablished the Corporate Sustainability Office (CSO) as an establishment directly in charge of Acer Group\'s CSR af-\nfairs. In line with the Company\'s new group-based strategy, a number of subsidiaries have become listed companies. As a result, \nour CSR governance structure faces changes, and thus we continue to review our CSR framework. In 2017, in response to the trans-\nformation of the company and changes in the global environment, we further adjusted our sustainability mission and CSR policy, \nensuring we are fully equipped to make good on our commitments to development that is sustainable on both the corporate and \nsocial  levels.  In  2018,  the  Company  undertook  a  comprehensive  review  of  CSR  framework,  reorganizing  the  2012-established \nGlobal Corporate Social Responsibility Committee (GCSRC) into the Corporate Sustainability Committee (CSC) to integrate corpo-\nrate social responsibility strategies and enhance Acer\'s ESG performance.\n\nIn the environment, safety and health management aspects, we implement office carbon reduction programs, enhance suppliers\' \ncapacity of greenhouse gases management, launch several projects to improve the health and safety of our employees and have \nthird party verification for the GHGs emissions data of Acer Group global operation sites every year. For supply chain management, \nwe conduct suppliers\' Social and Environmental Responsibility (SER) on-site audits, investigate smelters in our supply chain for \nconflict minerals issue to enhance the SER performance of acer suppliers. Regarding communication, we build a good communi-\ncation channel with stakeholders to ensure mutual understandings and respect, and we continuously improve the quality of our \ncustomer service and the protection of customer privacy. About community involvement, Acer is committed to give back to the \nsociety by creating digital opportunities for the disadvantages through Acer Volunteer Team and Acer Foundation.\n\n.\n\nAcer Incorporated 2018 Annual ReportCorporate Social ResponsibilityAcer Incorporated 2018 Annual ReportCorporate Social Responsibility\x0c90\n\n91\n\n6.1 Environment, Safety and Health Management\n\nsafety in the recycling process, we work with plastics manufacturers and upstream recyclers to conform to international standards \nof quality, environmental safety, occupational health and safety, and responsible recycling (R2), earning international export li-\ncenses and recycling service provision qualifications from local governments.\n\n6.1.1 The Environmental Protection\n\n1. Energy and Climate Change\n\nWe continue to implement the Acer Integrated Energy and Climate Change Policy. We have also formulated long-term carbon \nreduction targets in line with the methodology proposed by the Science Based Targeting initiative, and we expect to accomplish in \n2050 an 80% reduction in Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon emissions from the baseline year of 2009. In 2018, in line with GHG Protocol \nprinciples, we recalculated our benchmark for annual emissions based on structural changes.\n\nRegarding to the suppliers GHG management, we continually participate in the Carbon Disclosure Project Supply Chain Program, \nproviding the suppliers related training courses and consulting. We enforce suppliers\' capability on reacting to the climate change \nand saving energy and reduce emissions. Besides, we also encourage our suppliers to set reduction target to reduce the emission \nthrough the whole value chain. According to the report, our suppliers\' overall disclosure and performance on carbon reduction are \nover the average of the global suppliers\' performance.  \n\nOn the green electricity front, in 2017 Acer continued to expand our use of renewable energy in more operating locations, gradu-\nally expanding the use of renewable energy to achieve our medium-term goal of reducing carbon emissions by 60% by 2020.\n\n2. Green Product Management\n\nAcer\'s green product policy is:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Based on the \xe2\x80\x9cproduct life cycle\xe2\x80\x9d concept, we offer high-quality products that are energy and resource efficient, low in pollut-\n\nants and hazardous substances, and easy to recycle.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  By employing green purchasing and through communications with our suppliers we have been able to establish a green supply \n\nchain that is fully compliant with international environmental practice.\n\nAll of Acer\'s products are in compliance with regulatory and customer requirements in all respective territories, protecting the \nhealth and safety of users and reducing potential risk to the environment. In addition to legal compliance, we also proactively \ncomply with our various markets\' voluntary environmental demands including product life cycle considerations such as energy ef-\nficiency, reduced use of toxic and/or hazardous substances, and end-of-life product processing. Since 2009, Acer has kept launch-\ning PVC-free and BFR (Bromine Flame Retardants)-free products, and is steadily accomplishing the target of non-halogenated \nproducts. We also continually evaluate the related regulations and the concerns of external stakeholders, gradually extending the \ncontrol scope of the chemicals.\n\nAcer supports the concept of resource recycling. In 2018, we continued to use recycled plastics in display units and all-in-one com-\nputers, including the B6, V6, B7, & V7 lines of displays and our all-in-one desktop models.\n\nThrough the Acer Packaging Design Principles, we are able to examine the life cycle of our packaging material and make informed \ndecisions about the environmental impact of our packaging at every stage, from initial R&D into and selection of materials through \nproduction methods, transportation and fuel consumption, durability in use, and waste handling. The Acer Packaging Design Prin-\nciples also address ongoing reduction in design, the use of environmentally friendly materials, and improved recyclability. \n\nAcer is committed to improving energy efficiency in our products to help consumers reduce the amount of energy they consume \nwhile using our products. During product design, we comply with energy consumption guidelines in each of our markets, including \nthe European ErP eco-design directive. To ensure our products comply with the requirements of particular customers and markets \naround the world, we have acquired US Energy Star\xc2\xae and China Energy Conservation labels for selected products.\n\nAcer not only supports the concept of resource recycling, but also actively strives to use post-consumer recycled plastics (PCR) in \nour products. At the same time, with regard to the materials that are most likely to create problems of pollution or occupational \n\n3.Office Carbon Reduction\n\nAcer\'s energy consumption primarily comes from office electricity usage. Each year we collect data on electricity usage from our \noffices around the world to facilitate prompt adaptations. We also aim to reduce electricity usage through the use of green elec-\ntricity, improved office equipment, and stronger power management, coupled with ongoing assessment and planning of energy \nconservation measures. Acer Taiwan\'s total solar power generation reached 3.258 million kWh in 2018, enough to supply about \n930 households for one year. The Acer eDC Longtan office, meanwhile, deactivated the power transformers for some floors after \nan electricity demand assessment, resulting in an annual saving of approximately 348,000 kWh.\n\nThe main source of electricity consumption in our offices is air conditioning and lighting. Given this, in 2018 we changed out air \nconditioning equipment in two office areas, including the Zhizun Building at Acer Taiwan Aspire Park, and high-consumption light-\ning in six office areas including our Xizhi headquarters, in addition to undertaking renovations at four office areas, including Xizhi, \nto make use of energy-saving lighting. In addition, our office areas continue to pursue stronger power management, including \nthe use of monitoring systems to adjust the hours air conditioners are active, adjusting the temperature of water emitted by air \nconditioner chiller on a seasonal basis, and using lighting systems that automatically shut off during lunch breaks and after hours \nto control energy consumption.\n\n6.1.2 Safety and Health\n\n1.  Environmental Safety and Health Management\n\nAs a global IT company focused on marketing and service, Acer endeavors to achieve balanced development in economy, envi-\nronment and society. We are devoted to environmental protection. We understand that all our products, services and activities \nhave potential impact to the environment and community where we conduct business. We are also dedicated to providing a safe \nand healthy workplace for employees believing that occupational health and safety is the foundation of sound and responsible \nbusiness operations. We ensure all employees understand their roles and responsibilities and are working with our partners and \nsuppliers to meet or exceed the environmental, health and safety commitments. Our policies on environmental safety and health \nmanagement are as below:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Meet or exceed all applicable legal requirements, industry standards and voluntary agreements to which Acer subscribes.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \n\nImprove resource productivity by promoting pollution prevention, energy efficiency and waste reduction.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Carefully select raw materials and suppliers to provide safe and low environmental impact products.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Strive to create a safe and healthful workplace and to prevent occupational injury and illnesses.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Continuously improve EHS performance based on audit and communications.\n\nWe implement the Acer EHS management system to fulfill our pledges and reaching our corporate targets, including management \nof potential hazards to people and the environment, reducing the environmental impact of our company operations and products, \nregular monitoring to ensure we are compliant with relevant laws and Acer standards, and ensuring Acer staff enjoy a comfortable \nenvironment and attach importance to health and safety precautions\n\nIn 2018, most of Acer\'s Taiwan business units passed new ISO 14001:2015 environmental management system review and have \ncontinued to receive third-party certification. Some of our subsidiaries also passed ISO 14001:2015 review.\n\nAcer Incorporated 2018 Annual ReportCorporate Social ResponsibilityAcer Incorporated 2018 Annual ReportCorporate Social Responsibility\x0c92\n\n93\n\n2.  Working Environment and Employee Safety\n\nAcer cares about the working environment where employee\'s safety and health would largely depend on. We conducted a series \nof improvements, including water filtration system, drinking water quality, indoor air quality; strengthen the computer room and \nwarehouse safety. Acer also implemented environment, health and safety management system and conducted office sites hazards \nidentification. We then improved items with significant risks to lower the hazards.\n\n3.  Emergency Accident Operation\n\nAcer has established its own emergency operation procedures in the events of fire, earthquake, typhoon, power failure, water sup-\nply failure, contagious disease and other major accidents. In the fire safety aspect, we have organized a self-protection firefighting \nteam by the employees and their main duties are to extinguish the fire at the initial stage, evacuate the rest of the employees when \nnecessary and reduce possible damage from the accidents.\n\n4.  Employee Health \n\nAcer always cares about the health of colleagues. We keep promoting health management and promotion. In 2017, Acer applied for \nextended Healthy Workplace Certification. In 2018, Acer received the "sports enterprise certification from the minister of Educa-\ntion\'s Sports Administration" for the second consecutive year, further demonstrating our commitment to providing healthy work-\nplaces.\n\nMoreover, in order to strengthen workplace health promotion, we also hold afternoon lunch talks on health; offer weight loss class-\nes, smoking cessation classes, and physical fitness tests; hold sports competitions; set up health stations; and promote articles on \nhealth and wellbeing.\n\n6.2 Supply Chain Management\n\nWe treat our suppliers from all parts of the globe with consistent fairness in order to achieve efficient global operations and part-\nnerships and to provide clients with high quality products. We also strive to ensure that a safe working environment is provided \nthroughout the supply chain, that employees are treated with dignity and respect, and that suppliers observe ethical codes and \nshoulder their environmental responsibilities throughout their business operations. We will continuously investigate the necessary \nresponses to sustainability issues with a positive attitude and from a broad perspective so as to increase the positive effect of the \nsupply chain on society and the environment.\n\nAcer has been a member of the Responsible Business Alliance (RBA) (formerly the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC)) \nsince 2008, and actively participates in actions and discussions around supply chain social and environmental responsibility to \nbetter understand international trends in CSR and share in the practical experience of its members. All Acer manufacturers and \nservice providers are required to comply with both the RBA Code of Conduct and local regulations.\n\nIn addition, we carry out annual on-site RBA Code of Conduct vendor audits, gaining a deeper understanding of each location\'s \nworking environment and the human rights conditions of the staff. We also encourage and require vendors to uphold their cor-\nporate responsibility by ensuring their own vendors implement socially and environmentally responsible management and to ad-\nvocate for RBA Code of Conduct adherence, thus improving the working environment in the electronics supply chain worldwide.\n\nWe continue to communicate with vendors and enhance their ability to respond to sustainability issues, as well as encouraging \n\nvendors to incorporate sustainable development matters into their management agendas. In line with Acer\'s sustainable devel-\nopment strategy, we hold a variety of vendor sustainability conferences, and in our annual vendor CSR communication meetings, \nprovide information on the latest in CSR developments and trends, as well as analyzing important supply chain matters and po-\ntential actions that we can take together. These meetings also provide an opportunity for two-way communication between Acer \nand vendors, strengthening the supply chain\'s environmental and social responsibility and deepening our CSR-related cooperative \nrelationships.\n\nWe require new vendors pass the social and environmental responsibility assessment and sign an RBA Code of Conduct compliance \nstatement before they become official vendors. In order to put into practice environmental and social responsibility in Acerlnce \nstatement before they become official vendors. pliers to implement risk assessment and management based on the RBA Code of \nConduct. For higher risk suppliers, we also carry out on-site audits and management of follow-up improvement efforts. Addition-\nally, we incorporate performance in this regard into our vendor CSR scorecard assessments.\n\nAcer has taken multiple actions to verify the absence of forced labor, slavery and human trafficking in supply chain, including sup-\nplier risk assessment, declaration, on-site audit and training etc.\n\nRegarding to the topic on conflict minerals: Over the years, growing evidence has shown that mining is an intensive process in-\nvolving social and environmental risks. In 2017, Acer began the transformation of its conflict minerals program into a responsible \nminerals sourcing program with a broader focus that seeks to strategically identify priority minerals and regions that are a high \nrisk for negative social and environmental impacts. The mechanisms that drove the conflict minerals program are being adapted \nto address this broader focus, especially the supply chain tracing and due diligence processes that remain in alignment with the \nOECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas. In addition, \nAcer realigned its policy and internal procedures to drive this renewed focus.\n\nIn 2017 and 2018, Acer\'s responsible minerals sourcing program completed the transformation to this renewed focus. Acer has \nidentified and prioritized minerals for inclusion in our responsible sourcing strategy and they currently include Conflict Minerals or \n3TG from the DRC and its adjoining countries, cobalt from the DRC and tin from Indonesia. Acer will continue to reassess its prior-\nity minerals as well as be involved in the refining of the procedures to identify Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas (CAHRAs). \nIn 2018, Acer issued its first consolidated responsible minerals report, outlining the steps taken to conduct due diligence on all \npriority minerals. \n\nIn order to review suppliers\' SER performance, we established the acer suppliers CSR scorecard. Through the mechanism, we could \nknow and track suppliers\' environmental, social and governmental risks in early time and assist the suppliers to conduct the neces-\nsary measures to reduce or mitigate the risks. To implement acer suppliers\' environmental and social responsibility, our suppliers \nhave to conduct the risk assessment and management to their next-tier suppliers according to the RBA code of conduct. Besides, \nthey have to conduct on-site audit to the suppliers with high risk. We called the mentioned management \xe2\x80\x9cAcer RBA 2.0.\xe2\x80\x9d We in-\nclude the performance by the suppliers in the evaluation of CSR scorecard. In 2018, we continued to carry out vendor CSR score-\ncard evaluations, including overall carbon management, carbon reduction results, and green energy adoption status, using this to \nfurther improve the ability of our overall supply chain to respond to climate change.\n\n6.3 Communication\n\n6.3.1 Communication with Stakeholders\n\nAcer is positioned to be a global citizenship among its stakeholders. With that in mind, we endeavor to understand stakeholder\'s \nopinions and recommendations, and build a good communication channel with them to ensure mutual understandings and re-\nspects. Stakeholders are defined as consumers, investors, suppliers, media, Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs), govern-\nment, community, academia, trade organizations and others. In addition to CSR performance disclosure for stakeholders on all \nfronts via Acer\'s designated Acer Sustainability webpage.\n\nAcer Incorporated 2018 Annual ReportCorporate Social ResponsibilityAcer Incorporated 2018 Annual ReportCorporate Social Responsibility\x0c94\n\n95\n\nof charity.

In addition, we held four Cloud Professor teacher \ntraining sessions were held, focused on education in programming and IoT, with approximately 210 teachers participating. Over \nthe course of that same academic year, our four vehicles covered 175,199 km and helped foster over 1,000 \xe2\x80\x9creading kings.\xe2\x80\x9d We \nalso invited volunteers from universities and other walks of life to form reading volunteer teams to head into rural communities as \nstorytellers for the local children.\n\nIn addition to this, for several years Acer has organized the Longterm Smile Competition. In 2018, this competition was restruc-\ntured to incorporate smart technologies and IoT, relaunching as the Longterm Smile Internet of Beings Competition. With its first \nholding in this incarnation in 2018, the competition has continued to promote Taiwanese startup innovation. \n\nTo encourage today\'s youth to unleash their creative potential in the modern digital era, the Acer Foundation has for the second \ntime worked with the National Taiwan Science Education Center to hold the BeingLife Creativity Competition. This time, the com-\npetition attracted outstanding works from over 600 teams, from which a shortlist was compiled through judging interviews which \nlooked at the students\' insight into contemporary social issues. Each competing piece was the result of students\' observations of \nmodern life and attempts to incorporate technology in innovative ways, using cloud computing to solve everyday problems and \nshowcasing the value of the Internet of Things in creating an \xe2\x80\x9cInternet of Beings. \n\n6.3.2 Supplier CSR Communication Meeting\n\nEvery year, Acer invites representatives of our major vendors to participate in annual CSR Communication Meetings, sharing the \nlatest global trends in corporate sustainability and emphasizing Acer\'s requirements of and goals for supply chain CSR manage-\nment performance. At the 2017 Supplier CSR Communication Meeting, we announced a list of banned and restricted chemical \nsubstances, including substances that may impact the external environment or the health of operators. In 2018, with a focus on \ncircular economy, we invited the plastics recycler in our supply chain to share their practical operations and experiences to enhance \nthe overall supply chain\'s awareness of the topic and its gradual implementation in Acer\'s circular economy goal.\n\n6.3.3 Customer Relations\n\nAcer has always followed a quality policy of "Delivering zero-defect, competitive products and services on time" and adheres to \nthe concept of "Serve with honor and work with pride" in providing professional products and services.

We require a new \nemployee attend the training, emphasizing the importance of abid-\ning by the regulations. The standards of SBC, the core essence of CSR \nin doing business, are built-in Acer\'s performance appraisal system, \nwhich helps managerial staff to monitor the status of exercising the \nregulations. For any behavior that violates the regulations of SBC, \nthe disciplinary actions will be taken, including an employment \ndismissal.\n\n(4)  Have the criti-\ncal factors of \ncorporate social \nresponsibility \nbeen clearly \narticulated in \nthe performance \nappraisal system, \nwith fair and ef-\nfective rewarding \nor penalty system \nfollowed?\n\n4\n\n2. Fostering a Sustainable Environment\n\nAcer strives to lower the environmental impacts of our operation and \nproducts, and keeps improving the efficiency of resource usage. The \nmajor achievements of 2018 include:\n\na. Use of Post-Consumer Recycled Plastics\n\nAcer supports the concept of resource recycling, and as such we \nactively strive to use post-consumer recycled plastics (PCR) in our \nproducts. At the same time, with regard to the materials that are \nmost likely to create problems of pollution or occupational safety \nin the recycling process, we work with plastics manufacturers and \nupstream recyclers to conform to international standards of quality, \nenvironmental safety, occupational health and safety, and respon-\nsible recycling (R2), earning international export licenses and recy-\ncling service provision qualifications from local governments.\n\nb. Use of recycled paper in packaging\n\nAcer carefully considers the materials we use in our packaging, with \npackaging design emphasizing recyclability and making use of easily \nrecyclable materials a priority. In 2018, some 8% of all desktop com-\nputers shipped used molded pulp or folded paper packaging. Acer\'s \ndesktop computer models use brown carton inserts and boxes of \n100% recycled paper pulp. The notebook computers also use 100% \nrecycled EPE foam and 100% recycled paper for their packaging, \nminimizing its negative impact on the environment. On top of this, \nall of the posters included with products are produced with Forest \nStewardship Council certified paper, while all printing uses environ-\nmentally friendly water-based and soy inks.\n\nAcer adopted international standards ISO 14001 to establish the en-\nvironmental management system and keep maintaining the validity \nof the Certificate. In 2018, all of Acer\'s Taiwan business units passed \nnew ISO 14001:2015 environmental management system review \nand have continued to receive third-party certification. Some of our \nsubsidiaries have also passed ISO 14001:2015 review.\n\nNo discrepancy\n\nNo discrepancy\n\n(1)  Does the company \n\nendeavors to uti-\nlize all resources \nmore efficiently \nand uses renew-\nable materials \nwhich have a low \nimpact on the \nenvironment?\n\n(2)  Does the company \n\nestablish proper \nenvironmental-\nmanagement sys-\ntems based on the \ncharacteristics of \ntheir industries?\n\n4\n\n4\n\nAcer Incorporated 2018 Annual ReportCorporate Social ResponsibilityAcer Incorporated 2018 Annual ReportCorporate Social Responsibility\x0c98\n\n99\n\nImplementation Status\n\nAssessment Items\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nSummary Description\n\n(3)  Does the com-\n\npany monitor the \nimpact of climate \nchange on its \noperations and \nestablish com-\npany strategies \nfor energy conser-\nvation and carbon \nand greenhouse \ngas reduction?\n\n4\n\n3.

The economic data does not support FED to take \nmore aggressive monetary policy. As FED is more dovish in rate hiking, Central Bank of the Republic of China (Taiwan) is unlikely \nto raise interest rate. Short-term TWD and foreign currency deposits remain to be the most common used instruments for Acer to \noptimize return while reducing risk.\n\n2.Exchange Rate\n\nEUR may weaken in 2019 due to soft growth of economy and possible bouts of heightened political risk in Eurozone. USD would be \nthe natural outperformer in slowing global economy. US-China trade tensions have become a key driver of USD-RMB. The mon-\netary policies of major economies influence the stability of the currencies in emerging markets. Acer will maintain its strategy to \nmeticulously hedge its foreign positions to minimize the impacts on earnings caused by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\n\n3.Inflation\n\nAccording to recent IMF World Economic Outlook, An escalation of trade tensions, deeper-than-envisaged slowdown in China, \nand expectations of slower global growth lead to negative implications for global commodity prices. Consumer price inflation has \ngenerally remained contained. Appropriate measures will be taken accordingly to minimize impacts on business operation if need.\n\nAcer Incorporated 2018 Annual ReportRisk ManagementAcer Incorporated 2018 Annual ReportRisk Management\x0c116\n\n117\n\n8.6.2 The Policy Regarding High-Risk/Highly Leveraged In-\n\nvestments, Lending, Endorsements, and Guarantees for \nOther Parties; The Main Reasons for the Profits/Losses \nGenerated Thereby; And Response Measures To Be Tak-\nen In The Future\n\nCompany will use high-safety, high-liquidity, and fixed-income financial instruments provided by financial institutions with high \ncredit rating for the utilization of short-term idle funds.

Via multi-vendor strategies to separate the risks of cooperation with a single partner, the inventory management of Com-\npany will be more resilient. In addition, due to the uncertain global situation, crisis and challenges may occur at any time, Company \nactively strengthens the awareness of crisis management, develops preventive measures to avoid the occurrence of crisis, and \nestablishes risk management mechanism. If a crisis should be encountered, the losses of risk could be reduced to ensure Company \nwill be evergreen.\n\nAcer Incorporated 2018 Annual ReportRisk ManagementAcer Incorporated 2018 Annual ReportRisk Management\x0c118\n\n119\n\n8.6.7 Expected benefits and possible risks associated with \n\nany merger and acquisitions, and mitigation measures \nbeing or to be taken\n\nNone\n\n8.6.8 Predicted Benefits and Potential Risk to Company with \n\nFactory/Office Expansion\n\nNone\n\n8.6.9 Potential Risks to Company from the Consentration of \n\nProcurement and Sales\n\nNone\n\n8.6.10 Affect on Company from Shares Transfers by Direc-\n\ntors, Supervisors or Shareholders Holding More Than \n10% Shares\n\nNone\n\n8.6.11 Impact and Potential Risks to Company Management \n\nTeam Change\n\nNone\n\n8.6.12 The major litigious, non-litigious or administrative \n\ndisputes that: (1) involve Acer and/or any Acer direc-\ntor, any Acer supervisor, the general manager, any \nperson with actual responsibility for the firm, any ma-\njor shareholder holding a stake of greater than 10 %, \nand/or any company or companies controlled by Acer; \n\nand (2) have been concluded by means of a final and \nunappealable judgment, or are still under litigation. \nWhere such a dispute could materially affect share-\nholders\' equity or the prices of the company\'s secu-\nrities, the facts of the dispute, amount of money at \nstake in the dispute, the date of litigation commence-\nment, the main parties to the dispute, and the status \nof the dispute as of the date of printing of this annual \nreport shall be disclosed as follows\n\n1.  The status of the dispute as of the date of printing of this annual report:\n\n(1)  A US company filed a lawsuit against Acer in the superior court of California based on cause of actions for misappropria-\ntion of trade secrets and breach of a non-disclosure agreement. Acer has engaged external law firms to deal such litiga-\ntion. So far, the final verdict is still unpredictable; however, Acer has properly accrued provisions based on development \nof the aforesaid lawsuit. Thus, Acer foresees no immediate material adverse effect on the Acer\'s business operations and \nfinance.\n\n(2)  Acer from time to time receives notices from third parties asserting that Acer has infringed certain patents or demands \nAcer obtain certain patents licenses. Although Acer does not expect that outcome of the notices, individually or collec-\ntively, will have a material adverse effect on Acer\'s financial position or operation, given the outcome of legal proceedings \nare difficult to foresee, relevant settlements may affect Acer\'s result of operation or cash flow in a particular period.\n\nIn year 2018 and as of the date of printing of this annual report, any Acer director, supervisor, the general manager, any person \nwith actual responsibility for the firm, any major shareholder holding a stake of greater than 10% were not involved in any ma-\nterial litigious, non-litigious or administrative disputes of which the result could materially affect shareholders\' equity or the \nprices of Acer\'s securities.\n\nIn year 2018 and as of the date of printing of this annual report, any subsidiaries and affiliates controlled by Acer were not \ninvolved in any material litigious, non-litigious or administrative disputes of which the result could materially affect Acer share-\nholders\' equity or the prices of Acer\'s securities. \n\n2. \n\n3. \n\n8.6.13 Other important risks\n\nAcer\'s Risk Management Organizational Structure\n\nIn late 2012, Acer established the Risk Management Working Group, the membership of which spans the Legal, Finance, Human \nResource, Supply Chain Management, Enterprise Communication, Marketing, QA & Services, IT, Environmental Safety and Health, \nAsset Management, all Product Business Groups, and the Corporate Sustainability Office. Every year, the working group holds regu-\nlar meetings, inviting members of various working groups to engage in identifying, assessing, and discussing risks the Company \nmay face in three aspects: economic, environmental, and social.\n\nAdditionally, in 2018 Acer reorganized the former Global Corporate Social Responsibility Committee (GCSRC) into the Corporate \nSustainability Committee (CSC); the Risk Management Working Group is a unit under the CSC. We believe that this reorganization \nwill not only further strengthen our existing risk management practices, but also help in building a corporate culture with a strong \nawareness of risk management through the participation of top-level management from various departments and business units.\n\nAcer Incorporated 2018 Annual ReportRisk ManagementAcer Incorporated 2018 Annual ReportRisk Management\x0c120\n\n121\n\nChart of Acer\'s Risk Management Organizational Structure\n\nAcer\'s Risk Management Framework\n\nOverseers of Risk Appetite & Strategy \n\nBoard of Directors  \n\nAuditing\n\nInvestment \ncommission\n\nChairman\n\nRemuneration\n\nCommittee\n\nAudit\n\nCommittee\n\nSecretary Office of \n\nthe Board\n\nCorporate \n\nSustainability \n\nOffice\n\nUltimate Risk Owner\n\nCEO\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  The Global Legal Headquarters is responsible for legal risk management, reviewing and processing contract disputes, and so \n\non to reduce legal risk.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  The Global Information Technology Headquarters is responsible for the building and planning of overall information systems \n\nand information security management.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2  Global Financial Headquarters:\n\n 4 The Global Accounting and Business Analysis Head Office is responsible for verifying and checking global transactions, \n\nensuring the validity of transactions and reliability of financial statements.

In 2018, the Risk Management Working Group identified a total of 67 risk items, of \nwhich 10, in areas including IP and associated litigation risk, information security risk, and extreme climate risk, were categorized \nas medium-high risk or higher. Designated personnel from the relevant departments are responsible for the drafting of follow-up \nrisk management strategies related implementation plans with regard to risk items identified and analyzed, including commonly \nused response methods such as loss prevention planning, avoidance, separation & duplication, transfer, and retention. In addition, \nthey also assess appropriate resource inputs, execution priorities, methods for follow-up progress tracking. At the same time, risk \ncontingency plans and crisis management mechanisms are developed to reduce the possible adverse effects of various potential \nrisks on operations.

In response to \ninformation security risk, the Risk Management Working Group not only summarizes patterns of potential losses (including loss \nof goodwill, interruptions to operations, and data leakage), but also works with the IT Department to consolidate the basic capital \noperation principles and plans laid out below, as well as the gradual implementation of the ISO 27001 international information \nsecurity specification standard. Beyond this, in 2018 Acer organized a global cyber insurance policy, not only from consideration \nof risk transfer, but also in hopes of making use of the international insurance market to receive further assistance and resources \nfrom external information security experts.

Currently, \nour Supply Chain Management Department is assessing changes in low temperature that may be encountered during transporta-\ntion along particular routes, discussing and cooperating with shipping companies to enact feasible preventive measures based on \nthe type and characteristics of products.\n\nWith regard to future trends and potential negative impacts of trade protectionism risk, such as trade protectionism and related \ntrade barriers between countries and the imposition of tariffs on goods not produced domestically to alleviate trade deficits, ICT \nproducts produced in Asia are likely to become a point of focus, becoming a bargaining chip in trade negotiations and even causing \nchanges in pricing that may affect sales. The Risk Management Working Group has collated the types of losses that may occur (in-\ncluding a decline in sales or market share due to political/economic instability, labor-related costs due to migration of production \nbases, and so forth). We will closely monitor long-term development trends in trade protectionism and the subsequent impacts, \nwhile also continuing to expand into new niche markets and sales channels so as to distribute operational risks and reduce the \nimpact and uncertainty so caused.\n\n8.7 Other Necessary Supplement: None\n\nAcer Incorporated 2018 Annual ReportRisk ManagementAcer Incorporated 2018 Annual ReportRisk Management\x0c124\n\n125\n\nSpecial Notes\n1.

The extent and impact of changes are as follows:\n\n(i)\n\nIFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers\n\nIFRS 15 establishes a five-step model framework to determine the method, timing and amount\nof  revenue  recognized.  This  Standard  replaces  the  existing  revenue  recognition  guidance,\nincluding IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and the related interpretations. The\nGroup applies this standard retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying this\nStandard  recognized  at  the  date  of  initial  application.  The  Group  elected  not  to  restate  the\ncomparative information for the prior reporting period; but instead, continues to apply IAS 11,\nIAS 18 and the related Interpretations for comparative reporting period. The Group recognizes\nthe  cumulative  effect  upon  the  initial  application  of  this  Standard  as  an  adjustment  to  the\nopening balance of its retained earnings on January 1, 2018. \n\nThe Group uses the practical expedients for completed contracts, meaning, it need not restate\nthose contracts that have been completed on January 1, 2018.\n\nThe following are the nature and impacts on the changes of accounting policies:\n\nUnder IAS 18, revenue for the sale of goods was recognized when the related significant risks\nand rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred to the customers, the revenue and\nthe  cost  incurred,  or  to  be  incurred,  can  be  measured reliably, the economic benefits of the\ntransaction  will  probably  flow  to  the  Group,  and  there  is  neither  continuing  managerial\ninvolvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effect control over the goods\nsold. Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of the goods.\n\nFor certain contracts that give customers rebates or marketing support, revenue is recognized\nunder  IAS  18  when  relevant  allowance  could  be  reasonably  estimated  and  all  revenue\nrecognition criteria were met. Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognized for these contracts to the\nextent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue\nrecognized will not occur. A refund liability is recognized for the estimated sales allowance\nand presented separately in the statement of financial position.\n\n1)\n\nImpacts on financial statements\n\nThe  following  tables  summarize  the  impacts  of  adopting  IFRS  15  on  the  Group\xe2\x80\x99 s\nconsolidated financial statements.\n\nImpacted line items on the\nconsolidated balance sheet\nNotes and accounts\nreceivable, net\n\n$\n\nContract assets\xef\xbc\x8dcurrent\nInventories\nOther current assets\nImpact on assets\n\nDecember 31, 2018\n\nBalance prior\n\nto the\n\nadoption of\nIFRS 15\n47,887,830\n\nImpact of\nchanges in\naccounting\n\npolicies\n\n(396,235)\n\nBalance\nupon\n\nadoption of\nIFRS 15\n47,491,595\n\nBalance prior\n\nto the\n\nadoption of\nIFRS 15\n46,761,383\n\nJanuary 1, 2018\nImpact of\nchanges in\naccounting\n\npolicies\n\n(12,622)\n\nBalance\nupon\n\nadoption of\nIFRS 15\nNote\n46,748,761 Note 1\n\n-\n\n42,524,954\n3,307,851\n\n$\n\n396,235\n(448,545)\n448,545\n-\n\n396,235\n42,076,409\n3,756,396\n\n-\n\n40,079,221\n3,078,330\n\n12,622\n(578,467)\n578,467\n-\n\n12,622 Note 1\n39,500,754 Note 2\n3,656,797 Note 2\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n11\n\n$\n\nImpacted line items on the\nconsolidated balance sheet\nContract liabilities\xef\xbc\x8dcurrent\nOther payables\nOther current liabilities\nProvisions\xef\xbc\x8dcurrent\nRefund  liabilities\xef\xbc\x8dcurrent\nContract  liabilities\xef\xbc\x8dnon-\n\ncurrent\n\nOther non-current  liabilities\nImpact on liabilities\n\nDecember 31, 2018\n\nBalance prior\n\nto the\n\nadoption of\nIFRS 15\n\n-\n\n(36,170,574)\n(3,440,966)\n(6,192,798)\n\n-\n-\n\nImpact of\nchanges in\naccounting\n\npolicies\n\n(821,374)\n11,750,420\n821,374\n953,446\n(12,703,866)\n(1,405,350)\n\nBalance\nupon\n\nadoption of\nIFRS 15\n\n(821,374)\n(24,420,154)\n(2,619,592)\n(5,239,352)\n(12,703,866)\n(1,405,350)\n\nBalance prior\n\nto the\n\nadoption of\nIFRS 15\n\n-\n\n(37,219,141)\n(2,807,010)\n(6,656,001)\n\n-\n-\n\nJanuary 1, 2018\nImpact of\nchanges in\naccounting\n\nBalance\nupon\n\npolicies\n\n(608,275)\n13,126,578\n424,369\n1,281,123\n(13,488,170)\n(1,119,990)\n\nadoption of\nIFRS 15\n\nNote\n(608,275) Note 1\n(24,092,563) Note 2\n(2,382,641) Note 1\n(5,374,878) Note 2\n(13,488,170) Note 2\n(1,119,990) Note 1\n\n(3,084,788)\n\n1,405,350\n\n(1,679,438)\n\n(2,010,545)\n\n-\n\n384,365\n-\n\n(1,626,180) Note 1\n\nImpacted line items on the\n\nconsolidated statement of cash flows\nCash flows from operating activities:\nIncome before income tax\nAdjustments:\nChanges in operating assets and\n\nliabilities:\nContract assets\nNotes and accounts receivable, net\nInventories\nOther receivables and other current\n\nassets\n\nContract liabilities\nOther payables and other current\n\nliabilities\nProvisions\nRefund liabilities\nOther non-current  liabilities\n\nImpact on net cash flows provided by\n\n(used in) operating activities\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018\n\nBalance prior\nto the adoption\n\nof IFRS 15\n\nImpact of\nchanges in\naccounting\n\npolices\n\nBalance upon\nadoption of\nIFRS 15\n\n$\n\n4,252,380\n\n-\n\n4,252,380\n\n-\n\n(906,656)\n(2,304,356)\n(277,153)\n\n-\n\n(640,236)\n\n(472,654)\n\n-\n\n1,073,865\n\n(383,613)\n383,613\n(129,922)\n129,922\n\n498,459\n979,153\n\n327,677\n(784,304)\n(1,020,985)\n\n$\n\n-\n\n(383,613)\n(523,043)\n(2,434,278)\n(147,231)\n\n498,459\n338,917\n\n(144,977)\n(784,304)\n52,880\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n12\n\nNote  1:  For  certain  contracts,  the  Group  recognizes  revenue  when  it  satisfied  a  performance\nobligation but does not have an unconditional right to the considerations. Under IFRS 15,\ncontract  assets  and  revenue  are  recognized  for  such  situation,  different  from  accounts\nreceivable and revenue recognized prior to the adoption of IFRS 15. On the other hand,\nfor  certain  contracts,  the  Group  has  received  a  part  of  the  considerations  but  does  not\nsatisfy its obligations. Under IFRS 15, contract liabilities are recognized for such situation,\ndifferent  from  deferred  revenues  or  other  payables  recognized  under  other  current\nliabilities or other non-current liabilities prior to the adoption of IFRS 15. Both of them\nwere presented under other current liabilities or other non-current liabilities.\n\nNote 2: Prior to the adoption of IFRS 15, rebate payables were recognized under other payables,\nand allowance for sales returns were recognized under provisions. Under IFRS 15, both of\nthem are recognized under refund liabilities. Right to goods to be returned was recognized\nunder inventories prior to the adoption of IFRS 15. Under IFRS 15, it is presented under\nother current assets.\n\n(ii)\n\nIFRS 9 Financial Instruments\n\nIFRS 9 replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement which contains\nclassification and measurement of financial instruments, impairment, and hedge accounting.\n\nAs a result of the adoption of IFRS 9, the Group adopted the consequential amendments to\nIFRS  7  Financial  Instruments:  Disclosures  that  are  applied  to  disclosures  about  2018  but\ngenerally have not been applied to comparative information.\n\nThe details of new significant accounting policies and the nature and effect of the changes to\nIFRS 9 are as follows:\n\n1)\n\nClassification of financial assets and financial liabilities\n\nIFRS 9 contains three principal classification categories for financial assets: measured at\namortized cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (\xe2\x80\x9cFVOCI\xe2\x80\x9d) and fair value\nthrough profit or loss (\xe2\x80\x9cFVTPL\xe2\x80\x9d). The classification of financial assets under IFRS 9 is\ngenerally based on the business model in which financial assets are managed and their\ncontractual  cash  flow  characteristics.  The  standard  eliminates  the  previous  IAS  39\ncategories of held to maturity, loans and receivables and available-for-sale. Under IFRS\n9, if a hybrid contract contains a host that is within the scope of IFRS 9, the embedded\nderivatives  would  not  be  separated  from  the  host  contract;  instead,  the  entire  hybrid\ncontract is assessed for classification. Please refer to note 4(g) for an explanation of how\nthe Group classifies and measures its financial assets and accounts for related gains and\nlosses under IFRS 9.\n\nThe adoption of IFRS 9 has not had any significant impact on the Group\xe2\x80\x99s accounting\npolicies on financial liabilities.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n13\n\n2)\n\nImpairment of financial assets\n\nIFRS 9 replaces the \xe2\x80\x9cincurred loss\xe2\x80\x9d model in IAS 39 with a forward-looking \xe2\x80\x9cexpected\ncredit  loss\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9c ECL\xe2\x80\x9d )  model.  The  new  impairment  model  applies  to  financial  assets\nmeasured at amortized cost, contract assets, and debt investments at FVOCI, but not to\ninvestments in equity instruments. Under IFRS 9, credit losses are recognized earlier than\nunder IAS 39. Please refer to note 4(g) for more details.\n\n3)\n\nTransition\n\nThe adoption of IFRS 9 has generally been applied retrospectively, except as described\nbelow:\n\xe2\x80\xa7Differences in the carrying amounts of financial assets resulting from the adoption of\nIFRS  9  are  recognized  in  retained  earnings  and  other  equity  on  January  1,  2018.\nAccordingly,  the  information  presented  for  2017  does  not  generally  reflect  the\nrequirements of IFRS 9, and therefore, is not comparable to the information presented\nfor 2018 under IFRS 9.\n\xe2\x80\xa7The following assessments have been made on the basis of the facts and circumstances\nthat existed at the date of initial application.\n\n\xef\xbc\x8dThe determination of the business model within which a financial asset is held.\n\xef\xbc\x8d The  designation  and  revocation  of  financial  assets  and  financial  liabilities\n\npreviously designated as measured at FVTPL.\n\nmeasured at FVOCI.\n\n\xef\xbc\x8d The  designation  of  investments  in  equity  instruments  not  held  for  trading  as\n\xe2\x80\xa7If an investment in a debt security had low credit risk at the date of initial application of\nIFRS  9,  the  Group  shall  assume  that  the  credit  risk  on  the  asset  had  no  significant\nincrease since its initial recognition.\n\n4)\n\nClassification of financial assets on the date of initial application of IFRS 9\n\nThe following table shows the measurement categories and carrying amounts under IAS\n39 and IFRS 9 for each class of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s financial assets as of January 1, 2018.

The cash flows of these financial assets are\nnot solely payments of principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\nTherefore, the Group has classified these assets at the date of initial application of\nIFRS  9  as  mandatorily  measured  at  FVTPL  amounting  to  $286,414,  and  has\neliminated the interest receivables amounting to $849. As a result, an increase of\n$50,066 in retained earnings on January 1, 2018 was recognized.\n\nNote2:Under IAS 39, the right of profit-sharing was categorized as investments in debt\ninstrument  without  an  active  market.  The  financial  asset  was  managed  and\nmonitored  on  a  fair  value  basis,  and  therefore,  it  has  been  classified  as\nmandatorily  measured  at  FVTPL  under  IFRS  9.  An  increase  of  $5,501  in  the\ncarrying  amount  of  the  aforementioned  financial  asset  was  recognized  after  the\nmeasurement  of  its  fair  value,  resulting  in  the  increase  of  $3,480  in  retained\nearnings and $2,021 in non-controlling interests on January 1, 2018.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0c15\n\nACER INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nNote3:These equity instruments represent investments that the Group intends to hold for\nlong-term strategic purposes.

The related new, revised or amended standards and interpretations are set out\nbelow:\n\nNew, Revised or Amended Standards and Interpretations\n\nIFRS 16 Leases\nIFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments\nAmendments to IFRS 9 Prepayment features with negative compensation\nAmendments to IAS 19 Plan Amendment, Curtailment or Settlement\nAmendments to IAS 28 Long-term interests in associates and joint ventures\nAnnual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2015\xe2\x80\x932017 Cycle\n\nEffective date\n\nper IASB\n\nJanuary 1, 2019\nJanuary 1, 2019\nJanuary 1, 2019\nJanuary 1, 2019\nJanuary 1, 2019\nJanuary 1, 2019\n\nExcept for the items discussed below, the Group believes that the initial adoption of the above IFRSs\nwould not have any material impact on its consolidated financial statements. The extent and impact\nof significant changes are as follows:\n\n(i)\n\nIFRS 16 Leases\n\nIFRS 16 replaces the existing leases guidance, including IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining\nwhether an Arrangement contains a Lease, SIC-15 Operating Leases \xe2\x80\x93 Incentives and SIC-27\nEvaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease.\n\nIFRS  16  introduces  a  single  and  an  on-balance  sheet  lease  accounting  model  for  lessees.  A\nlessee recognizes a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a\nlease  liability  representing  its  obligation  to  make  lease  payments.  In  addition,  the  nature  of\nexpenses related to those leases will now be changed since IFRS 16 replaces the straight-line\noperating lease expense with a depreciation charge for right-of-use assets and interest expense\non lease liabilities. There are recognition exemptions for short-term leases and leases of low-\nvalue items. The lessor accounting remains similar to the current standard, i.e., the lessors will\ncontinue to classify leases as finance or operating leases.\n\n1)\n\nDetermining whether an arrangement contains a lease\n\n On transition to IFRS 16, the Group can choose to apply either of the following: \n\xe2\x80\xa7IFRS 16 definition of lease to all its contracts; or \n\xe2\x80\xa7 a  practical  expedient  that  does  not  need  any  reassessment  whether  a  contract  is,  or\ncontains, a lease. \n\nThe Group plans to apply IFRS 16 definition of lease to all its contracts upon transition.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0c17\n\nACER INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n2)\n\nTransition\n\nAs a lessee, the Group can apply the standard using either of the following: \n\xe2\x80\xa7retrospective approach; or \n\xe2\x80\xa7modified retrospective approach with optional practical expedients. \nThe Group plans to initially apply IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach.\nTherefore, the cumulative effect of adopting IFRS 16 will be recognized as an adjustment\nin the opening balance of retained earnings at January 1, 2019, with no restatement of\ncomparative information. \n\nWhen  applying  the  modified  retrospective  approach  to  leases  previously  classified  as\noperating leases under IAS 17, the lessee can elect, on a lease-by-lease basis, whether to\napply  a  number  of  practical  expedients  on  transition.  The  Group  chooses  to  elect  the\nfollowing practical expedients:\n\xe2\x80\xa7 apply a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics;\n\xe2\x80\xa7 apply  the  exemption,  and  not  to  recognize  the  right-of-use assets and lease liabilities\nwith lease term that ends within 12 months at the date of initial application;\n\xe2\x80\xa7 exclude  the  initial  direct  costs  from  measuring  the  right-of-use  assets  at  the  date  of\ninitial application; and\n\xe2\x80\xa7use hindsight to determine the lease term while the contract contains options to extend\nor terminate the lease.\n\n3)\n\nSo far, the most significant impact identified is that the Group will have to recognize the\nright-of-use  assets  and  lease  liabilities  for  the  operating  leases  of  its  offices  and\nwarehouses, which will result in an increase of $2,490,700 in its right-of-use assets and\nlease liabilities on January 1, 2019. Besides, The Group does not expect the adoption of\nIFRS  16  to  have  any  impact  on  its  ability  to  comply  with  the  maximum  leverage\nthreshold  loan  covenant.  Also,  the  Group  is  not  required  to  make  any adjustments for\nleases in which the Group is the intermediate lessor in a sub-lease.\n\n(ii)\n\nIFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments\n\nIn assessing whether and how an uncertain tax treatment affects the determination of taxable\nprofit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits, as well as tax rates, an entity\nshall assume that a taxation authority will examine the amounts it has the right to examine and\nhave a full knowledge on all related information when making those examinations.\n\nIf an entity concludes that it is probable that the taxation authority will accept an uncertain tax\ntreatment, the entity shall determine the taxable profit (tax loss), tax bases, unused tax losses,\nunused tax credits, as well as tax rates consistently with the tax treatment used or planned to be\nused in its income tax filings. Otherwise, an entity shall reflect the effect of uncertainty for\neach  uncertain  tax  treatment  by  using  either  the  most  likely  amount  or  the  expected  value,\ndepending  on  which  method  the  entity  expects  to  better  predict  the  resolution  of  the\nuncertainty.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n18\n\nSo far, the Group assessed that the adoption of the new interpretation will not have significant\nimpacts.  However,  the  actual  impacts  of  adopting  the  amended  standards  and  new\ninterpretations may change depending on the economic conditions and events which may occur\nin the future.\n\n(c)\n\nImpact of IFRSs issued by the IASB but not yet endorsed by the FSC\n\nA summary of new and amended standards issued by the IASB but not yet endorsed by the FSC is\nset out below:\n\nNew, Revised or Amended Standards and Interpretations\n\nAmendments to IFRS 3 Definition of a Business\nAmendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 Sale or Contribution of Assets Between an\n\nInvestor and Its Associate or Joint Venture\n\nIFRS 17 Insurance Contracts\nAmendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 Definition of Material\n\nEffective date\n\nper IASB\n\nJanuary 1, 2020\nEffective date to\nbe determined\nby IASB\nJanuary 1, 2021\nJanuary 1, 2020\n\nThose which may be relevant to the Group are set out below:\nIssuance / Release\n\nStandards or\nInterpretations\n\nDates\n\nOctober 31, 2018\n\nAmendments to IAS 1 and IAS\n8 Definition of Material\n\nContent of amendment\n\nfeatured  elsewhere \n\nThe  amendments  clarify  the  definition  of\nmaterial  and  how  it  should  be  applied  by\nincluding in the definition guidance that until\nnow  has \nIFRS\nStandards.

Finally,  the  amendments  ensure\nthat  the  definition  of  material  is  consistent\nacross all IFRS Standards.\n\nin \n\nThe Group is currently evaluating the impact on its consolidated financial position and consolidated\nfinancial performance upon the initial adoption of the abovementioned standards. The results thereof\nwill be disclosed when the Group completes its evaluation.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n19\n\n4.\n\nSummary of significant accounting policies\nThe significant accounting policies presented in the consolidated financial statements are summarized as\nfollows and have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financial statements.\n\n(a)\n\nStatement of compliance   \n\nThe  Group\xe2\x80\x99 s  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  have  been  prepared  in  accordance\nwith the \xe2\x80\x9cRegulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Issuers\xe2\x80\x9d (the\n\xe2\x80\x9c Regulations\xe2\x80\x9d )  and  the  IFRSs,  IASs,  IFRIC  Interpretations  and  SIC  Interpretations  endorsed  and\nissued into effect by the FSC (collectively as \xe2\x80\x9cTaiwan-IFRSs\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\n(b) Basis of preparation\n\n(i)\n\nBasis of measurement\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost\nbasis except for the following items:\n\n1)\n\n2)\n\n3)\n\nFinancial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss (including derivative\nfinancial instruments);\nFinancial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (Available-\nfor-sale financial assets measured at fair value) ; and\nNet defined benefit liability measured at present value of defined benefit obligation less\nthe fair value of plan assets.\n\n(ii) Functional and presentation currency\n\nThe functional currency of each Group entity is determined based on the primary economic\nenvironment in which the entity operates. The Group\xe2\x80\x99s consolidated financial statements are\npresented in New Taiwan dollars, which is the Company\xe2\x80\x99s functional currency. Except when\notherwise  indicated,  all  financial  information  presented  in  New  Taiwan  dollars  has  been\nrounded to the nearest thousand.\n\n(c) Basis of consolidation\n\n(i)\n\nPrinciples of preparation of the consolidated financial statements\n\nThe  accompanying  consolidated  financial  statements  incorporate  the  financial  statements  of\nthe Company and its controlled entities (the subsidiaries) in which the Company is exposed, or\nhas right, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect\nthose returns through its power over the investee.\n\nThe  financial  statements  of  the  subsidiaries  are  included  in  the  consolidated  financial\nstatements  from  the  date  that  control  commences  until  the  date  that  control  ceases.  All\nsignificant inter-company transactions, balances and resulting unrealized income and loss are\neliminated on consolidation. Total comprehensive income (loss) of a subsidiary is attributed to\nthe shareholders of the Company and the non-controlling interests even if this results in the\nnon-controlling interests having a deficit balance.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n20\n\nWhen  necessary,  financial  statements  of  subsidiaries  are  adjusted  to  align  the  accounting\npolicies with those adopted by the Company. \n\nChanges in the Group\xe2\x80\x99s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control\nare accounted for as equity transactions. The difference between the adjustment of the non-\ncontrolling interests and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognized in\nequity and attributed to the shareholders of the Company.\n\nWhen the Group loses control of a subsidiary, a gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss,\nwhich  is  calculated  as  the  difference  between  (1)  the  aggregate  of  the  fair  value  of\nconsideration received and the fair value of any retained interest at the date when control is\nlost,  and  (2)  the  previous  carrying  amount  of  the  former  subsidiary\'s  assets  (including\ngoodwill), liabilities and non-controlling interest at the date when the Group loses control. All\namounts recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to the subsidiary are accounted\nfor on the same basis as would be required if the Group had directly disposed of the related\nassets and liabilities.\n\nThe fair value of any investment retained in a former subsidiary at the date when control is lost\nis regarded as the cost on initial recognition of a financial asset measured at fair value through\nother  comprehensive  income  (available-for-sale  financial  asset)  or  an  investment  in  an\nassociate.\n\n(ii) List of subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements\n\nThe subsidiaries included in the consolidated financial statements at the end of the reporting\nperiod were as follows:\n\n Name of\nInvestor\n\nThe Company Acer Greater China (B.V.I.)

Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting\nfrom the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at exchange rates at the end\nof the period (the \xe2\x80\x9creporting date\xe2\x80\x9d) of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign\ncurrencies are recognized in profit or loss.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n27\n\nNon-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair\nvalue  are  retranslated  at  the  exchange  rate  prevailing  at  the  date  when  the  fair  value  is\ndetermined.  Exchange  differences  arising  on  the  translation  of  non-monetary  items  are\nrecognized in profit or loss, except for exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-\nmonetary  items  in  respect  of  which  gains  and  losses  are  recognized  directly  in  other\ncomprehensive income, in which case, the exchange differences are also recognized directly in\nother comprehensive income. Non-monetary items denominated in foreign currencies that are\nmeasured at historical cost are not retranslated.\n\n(ii) Foreign operations\n\nThe assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments\narising  from  acquisition,  are  translated  into  the  presentation  currency  of  the  Group\xe2\x80\x99 s\nconsolidated financial statements at the exchange rates at the reporting date.

All resulting exchange differences are recognized in\nother comprehensive income.\n\nOn the disposal of a foreign operation which involves a loss of control over a subsidiary or loss\nof significant influence over an associate that includes a foreign operation, all of the exchange\ndifferences accumulated in equity in respect of that operation attributable to the shareholders\nof the Company are entirely reclassified to profit or loss.  In the case of a partial disposal that\ndoes  not  result  in  the  Group  losing  control  over  a  subsidiary,  the  proportionate  share  of\naccumulated  exchange  differences  is  reclassified  to  non-controlling  interests.  For  a  partial\ndisposal of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s ownership interest in an associate or joint venture, the proportionate\nshare of the accumulated exchange differences in equity is reclassified to profit or loss.\n\nWhen the settlement of a monetary receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is neither\nplanned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future, the monetary item is, in substance, a part\nof net investment in that foreign operation, and the related foreign exchange gains and losses\nthereon are recognized as other comprehensive income.\n\n(e) Classification of current and non-current assets and liabilities\n\nAn  asset  is  classified  as  current  when  one  of  the  following  criteria  is  met;  all  other  assets  are\nclassified as non-current assets:\n\nIt is expected to be realized, or intended to be sold or consumed in the normal operating cycle;\nIt is held primarily for the purpose of trading;\nIt is expected to be realized within twelve months after the reporting period; or \n\n(i)\n(ii)\n(iii)\n(iv) The asset is cash or a cash equivalent unless the asset is restricted from being exchanged or\n\nused to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.\n\nA liability is classified as current when one of the following criteria is met; all other liabilities are\nclassified as non-current liabilities:\n\n(i)\n(ii)\n(iii)\n\nIt is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle;\nIt is held primarily for the purpose of trading;\nIt is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period; or \n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n28\n\n(iv) The Group does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least\ntwelve months after the reporting period. Terms of a liability that could, at the option of the\ncounterparty,  result  in  its  settlement  by  issuing  equity  instruments  do  not  affect  its\nclassification.\n\n(f) Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash consists of cash on hand, checking deposits, and demand deposits.  Cash equivalents consist of\nshort-term and highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and\nare subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.  Time deposits that meet the aforesaid criteria\nand are not held for investing purposes are also classified as cash equivalents.\n\nBank  overdrafts  that  are  repayable  on  demand  and  form  an  integral  part  of  the  Group\xe2\x80\x99 s  cash\nmanagement  are  included  as  a  component  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents  for  the  purpose  of  the\nconsolidated statement of cash flows.\n\n(g)\n\nFinancial instruments\n\n(i)\n\nFinancial assets (applicable commencing January 1, 2018)\n\nFinancial assets are classified into the following categories: measured at amortized cost, fair\nvalue through other comprehensive income (\xe2\x80\x9cFVOCI\xe2\x80\x9d), and fair value through profit or loss\n(\xe2\x80\x9cFVTPL\xe2\x80\x9d). A regular way purchase or sale of financial assets is recognized and derecognized\non a trade-date basis.\n\nThe Group shall reclassify all affected financial assets only when it changes its business model\nfor managing its financial assets.\n\n1)\n\nFinancial assets measured at amortized cost\n\nA  financial  asset  is  measured  at  amortized  cost  if  it  meets  both  of  the  following\nconditions and is not designated as at FVTPL:\n\xef\x82\xb7 it is held within a business model whose objective is to hold financial assets to collect\n\ncontractual cash flows; and\n\n\xef\x82\xb7 its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments\n\nof principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nA financial asset measured at amortized cost is initially recognized at fair value, plus any\ndirectly  attributable  transaction  costs.  These  assets  are  subsequently  measured  at\namortized cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses. Interest\nincome, foreign exchange gains and losses, and recognition (reversal) of impairment loss\nare recognized in profit or loss. Any gain or loss on derecognition is recognized in profit\nor loss.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n2)\n\nFinancial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income \n\n29\n\nA debt investment is measured at FVOCI if it meets both of the following conditions and\nis not designated as at FVTPL:\n\xef\x82\xb7 it  is  held  within  a  business  model  whose  objective  is  achieved  by  both  collecting\n\ncontractual cash flows and selling financial assets; and\n\n\xef\x82\xb7 its contractual terms give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments\n\nof principal and interest on the principal amount outstanding.\n\nOn initial recognition of an equity investment that is not held for trading, the Group may\nirrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in the investment\xe2\x80\x99s fair value in other\ncomprehensive income. This election is made on an instrument-by-instrument basis.\n\nA  financial  asset  measured  at  FVOCI  is  initially  recognized  at  fair  value,  plus  any\ndirectly  attributable  transaction  costs.  These  assets  are  subsequently  measured  at  fair\nvalue. Foreign exchange gains and losses, interest income calculated using the effective\ninterest method, and impairment losses deriving from debt investments, are recognized in\nprofit  or  loss;  whereas  dividends  deriving  from  equity  investments  are  recognized  in\nprofit or loss, unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of an\ninvestment. Other changes in the carrying amount of financial assets measured at FVOCI\nare  recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income  and  accumulated  in  other  equity  as\nunrealized  gain  (loss)  from  financial  assets  measured  at  fair  value  through  other\ncomprehensive income. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in other equity\nof  debt  investments  are  reclassified  to  profit  or  loss.  However,  gains  and  losses\naccumulated  in  other equity of equity investments are reclassified to retained earnings\ninstead of profit or loss.\n\nDividend  income  derived  from  equity  investments  is  recognized  on  the  date  that  the\nGroup\xe2\x80\x99s right to receive the dividends is established (usually the ex-dividend date).\n\n3)\n\nFinancial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss \n\nAll financial assets not classified as measured at amortized cost or at FVOCI described\nas  above  are  measured  at  FVTPL,  including  derivative  financial  assets  and  non-\nderivative financial assets (e.g., convertible bond and right of profit-sharing). On initial\nrecognition,  the  Group  may  irrevocably  designate  a  financial  asset,  which  meets  the\nrequirements to be measured at amortized cost or at FVOCI, as at FVTPL if doing so\neliminates or significantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.\n\nFinancial  assets  in  this  category  are  initially  recognized  at  fair  value.  Attributable\ntransaction  costs  are  recognized  in  profit  or  loss  as  incurred.  Subsequent  to  initial\nrecognition, they are measured at fair value, any changes therein, including any dividend\nand interest income, are recognized in profit or loss.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n4)\n\nImpairment of financial assets\n\n30\n\nThe  Group  recognizes  loss  allowances  for  expected  credit  losses  on  financial  assets\nmeasured  at  amortized  cost  (including  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  notes  and  accounts\nreceivable, other receivables, and other financial assets) and contract assets.\n\nThe Group measures loss allowances for accounts receivable, contract assets and other\nfinancial assets at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit loss (\xe2\x80\x9cECL\xe2\x80\x9d), except for\nthe following financial assets which are measured using 12-month ECL:\n\n\xef\x82\xb7 debt securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date; and\n\xef\x82\xb7 other debt securities and bank balances for which credit risk (i.e., the risk of default\noccurring  over  the  expected  life  of  the  financial  instrument)  has  not  increased\nsignificantly since initial recognition.\n\nLifetime ECLs are the ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected\nlife of a financial instrument. 12-month ECLs are the portion of ECLs that result from\ndefault events that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date (or a shorter\nperiod if the expected life of the instrument is less than 12 months).\n\nThe  maximum  period  considered  when  estimating  ECLs  is  the  maximum  contractual\nperiod over which the Group is exposed to credit risk.\n\nWhen determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly\nsince  initial  recognition,  the  Group  considers  reasonable  and  supportable  information\nthat is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. The information includes both\nquantitative  and  qualitative  information  and  analysis  based  on  the  Group\xe2\x80\x99 s  historical\nexperience and credit assessment, as well as forward-looking information.\n\nECLs  are  probability-weighted  estimate  of  credit  losses  over  the  expected  life  of\nfinancial assets. Credit losses are measured as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e.,\nthe difference between the cash flows due to the Group in accordance with the contract\nand  the  cash  flows  that  the  Group  expects  to  receive).  ECLs  are  discounted  at  the\neffective interest rate of the financial asset.\n\nLoss allowances for financial assets measured at amortized cost are deducted from the\ngross carrying amount of the assets. The recognition or reversal  of the loss allowance is\nrecognized in profit or loss.\n\nThe gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off, either partially or in full, to\nthe extent that there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case when\nthe Group determines that the debtor does not have assets or sources of income that could\ngenerate sufficient cash flows to repay the amounts subject to the write-off. However,\nfinancial  assets  that  are  written  off  could  still  be  subject  to  enforcement  activities  in\norder to comply with the Group\xe2\x80\x99s procedures for recovery of amounts due.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0c31\n\nACER INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n5)\n\nDerecognition of financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are derecognized when the contractual rights of the cash inflow from the\nassets are terminated, or when the Group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards\nof ownership of the financial assets to other enterprises.\n\nOn derecognition of a debt instrument in its entirety, the difference between the carrying\namount and the sum of the consideration received or receivable and any cumulative gain\nor  loss  that  had  been  recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income  and  accumulated  in\n\xe2\x80\x9cother equity\xe2\x80\x93unrealized gain (loss) from financial assets measured at fair value through\nother  comprehensive  income\xe2\x80\x9d   is  recognized  in  profit  or  loss,  and  included  in  non-\noperating income and loss.\n\nOn derecognition of a debt instrument other than in its entirety, the Group allocates the\nprevious  carrying  amount  of  the  debt  instrument  between  the  part  it  continues  to\nrecognize under continuing involvement, and the part it no longer recognizes on the basis\nof  the  relative  fair  values  of  those  parts  on  the  date  of  the  transfer.  The  difference\nbetween the carrying amount allocated to the part that is no longer recognized and the\nsum of the consideration received or receivable for the part no longer recognized and any\ncumulative gain or loss allocated to it that had been recognized in other comprehensive\nincome is recognized in profit or loss, and included in non-operating income and loss. A\ncumulative  gain  or  loss  that  had  been  recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income  is\nallocated between the part that continues to be recognized and the part that is no longer\nrecognized on the basis of the relative fair values of those parts.\n\n(ii) Financial assets (applicable before January 1, 2018)\n\nFinancial  assets  are  classified  into  the  following  categories:  financial  assets  at  fair  value\nthrough profit or loss, loans and receivables, and available-for-sale financial assets. A regular\nway purchase or sale of financial assets is recognized or derecognized on a trade-date basis. \n\n1)\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss \n\nFinancial  assets  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss consist of financial assets held for\ntrading  and  those  designated  as  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  at  inception.  A\nfinancial  asset  is  classified  in  this  category  if  acquired  principally  for  the  purpose  of\nselling in the short term. Derivatives are also categorized as financial assets at fair value\nthrough  profit  or  loss  unless  they  are  designated  as  hedges.  The  Group  designates\nfinancial assets, other than ones classified as held for trading, as at fair value through\nprofit or loss at initial recognition under one of the following situations:\n\n\xef\x82\xb7 Such  designation  eliminates  or  significantly  reduces  a  measurement  or  recognition\ninconsistency  that  would  otherwise  arise  from  measuring  assets  or  liabilities  or\nrecognizing the gains and losses on them on a different basis;\n\n\xef\x82\xb7 Performance of the financial asset is evaluated on a fair value basis; \n\xef\x82\xb7 A hybrid instrument contains one or more embedded derivatives.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n32\n\nAt  initial  recognition,  financial  assets  carried  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  are\nrecognized at fair value. Any attributable transaction costs are recognized in profit or loss\nas  incurred.  Subsequent  to  the  initial  recognition,  changes  in  fair  value  (including\ndividend  income  and  interest  income)  are  recognized  in  profit  or  loss  and  included  in\nnon-operating income and loss. \n\n2)\n\nLoans and receivables\n\nLoans  and  receivables  are  non-derivative  financial  assets  with  fixed  or  determinable\npayments  that  are  not  quoted  in  an  active  market.  Loans  and  receivables  comprise\naccounts  receivable,  other  receivables  and  investments  in  debt  instrument  without  an\nactive  market.  At  initial  recognition,  such  assets  are  recognized  at  fair  value  plus  any\ndirectly  attributable  transaction  costs.  Subsequent  to  initial  recognition,  loans  and\nreceivables  other  than  insignificant  interest  on  short-term  receivables  are  measured  at\namortized  cost  using  the  effective  interest  method  less  any  impairment losses. Interest\nincome is recognized as non-operating income in profit or loss.\n\n3)\n\nAvailable-for-sale financial assets\n\nAvailable-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are designated\nas available for sale or are not classified in any of the other categories of financial assets.\nAt initial recognition, available-for-sale financial assets are recognized at fair value plus\nany directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, these assets\nare  measured  at  fair  value,  and  changes therein, other than impairment losses, interest\nincome  calculated  using  the  effective  interest  method,  dividend  income,  and  foreign\ncurrency differences on monetary financial assets, are recognized in other comprehensive\nincome and accumulated in other equity as unrealized gain (loss) from available-for-sale\nfinancial  assets.  When  the  financial  asset  is  derecognized,  the  gain  or  loss  previously\naccumulated in equity is reclassified to profit or loss. \n\nDividends received from equity investments are recognized as non-operating income on\nthe date of entitlement to receive the dividends (usually the ex-dividend date). \n\n4)\n\nImpairment of financial assets\n\nFinancial assets, other than those carried at fair value through profit or loss, are assessed\nfor indicators of impairment at the end of each reporting date. Those financial assets are\nconsidered  to  be  impaired  when  there  is  objective  evidence  that,  as  a result of one or\nmore  events  that  occurred  after  the  initial  recognition  of  the  financial  assets,  their\nestimated future cash flows have been affected. \n\nEvidence  of  impairment  may  include  indications  that  the  debtor  is  experiencing\nsignificant financial difficulty, default or delinquency in interest or principal payments,\nindications  that  the  debtor  or  issuer  will  probably  enter  bankruptcy  or  other  financial\nreorganization, and the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because\nof  financial  difficulties.  For  available-for-sale  equity  investments,  a  significant  or\nprolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is also evidence that the\nassets are impaired. \n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n33\n\nIf  the  Group  determines  that  no  objective  evidence  of  impairment  exists  for  an\nindividually  assessed  account  receivable,  whether  significant  or  not,  such  account\nreceivable  is  included  in  a  group  of  accounts  receivable  with  similar  credit  risk\ncharacteristics which are then collectively assessed for impairment.  Objective evidence\nthat receivables are impaired includes the Group\xe2\x80\x99s collection experience in the past, an\nincrease of delayed payments, and national or local economic conditions that correlate\nwith arrears of receivables.\n\nAn  impairment  loss  is  recognized  by  reducing  the  carrying  amount  of  the  respective\nfinancial assets with the exception of receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced\nthrough  an  allowance  account.  Except  for  the  write-off  of  uncollectible  receivables\nagainst  the  allowance  account,  changes  in  the  amount  of  the  allowance  account  are\nrecognized in profit or loss.\n\nAn impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortized cost is measured\nas the excess of the asset\xe2\x80\x99s carrying amount over the present value of the estimated future\ncash  flows  discounted  at  the  financial  asset\xe2\x80\x99 s  original  effective  interest  rate.  If,  in  a\nsubsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be\nrelated  objectively  to  an  event  occurring  after  the  impairment  was  recognized,  the\npreviously recognized impairment loss is reversed to the extent that the carrying amount\nof the financial assets at the date the impairment loss is reversed does not exceed what\nthe amortized cost would have been had the impairment loss not been recognized.\n\nWhen  an  impairment  loss  is  recognized  for  an  available-for-sale  asset,  the  cumulative\ngains  or  loss  that  had  been  recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income  is  reclassified\nfrom equity to profit or loss. Any subsequent recovery in the fair value of an impaired\navailable-for-sale  equity  security  is  recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income,  and\naccumulated  in  other  equity.  If,  in  a  subsequent  period,  the  fair  value  of  an  impaired\navailable-for-sale debt security increases and the increase can be related objectively to an\nevent  occurring  after  the  impairment  loss  was  recognized,  then  the  impairment  loss  is\nreversed, with the amount of the reversal recognized in profit or loss. \n\nImpairment  losses  and  recoveries  of  accounts  receivable  are  recognized  as  operating\nexpenses.  Impairment  losses  and  recoveries  of  other  financial assets are recognized as\nother gains and losses under non-operating income and loss.\n\n5)\n\nDerecognition of financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are derecognized when the contractual rights of the cash inflow from the\nasset are terminated, or when the Group transfers substantially all the risks and rewards\nof ownership of the financial assets to other enterprises.\n\nOn derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the carrying\namount and the sum of the consideration received or receivable and any cumulative gain\nor  loss  that  had  been  recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income  and  accumulated  in\n\xe2\x80\x9c other  equity  \xe2\x80\x93   unrealized  gain  (loss)  from  available-for-sale  financial  assets\xe2\x80\x9d   is\nrecognized in profit or loss, and included in non-operating income and loss.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0c34\n\nACER INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nOn  derecognition  of  part  of  a  financial  asset,  the  previous  carrying  amount  of  the\nfinancial asset shall be allocated between the part that continues to be recognized and the\npart that is derecognized, on the basis of relative fair values of those parts on the date of\ntransfer. The difference between the carrying amount allocated to the part derecognized\nand the sum of the consideration received or receivable for the part of the financial asset\nderecognized  and  the  cumulative  gain  or  loss  that  has  been  recognized  in  other\ncomprehensive income allocated to the part derecognized is charged to profit or loss and\nincluded  in  non-operating  income  and  loss.  A  cumulative  gain  or  loss  that  had  been\nrecognized in other comprehensive income is allocated between the part that continues to\nbe recognized and the part that is derecognized, based on the relative fair values of those\nparts.\n\n(iii) Financial liabilities and equity instruments\n\n1)\n\nClassification of debt or equity\n\nDebt or equity instruments issued by the Group are classified as financial liabilities or\nequity  in  accordance  with  the  substance  of  the  contractual  agreement.  An  equity\ninstrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group\nafter deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments are recognized at the amount of\nconsideration received less the direct issuing cost.\n\nInterest and gain or loss related to the financial liability are recognized in profit or loss\nand included in non-operating income and loss.\n\n2)\n\nFinancial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss\n\nA financial liability is classified in this category if it is classified as held for trading or is\ndesignated as a financial liability measured at fair value through profit or loss on initial\nrecognition.  A  financial  liability  is  classified  as  held  for  trading  if  it  is  acquired\nprincipally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the short term.  Derivatives are\nalso categorized as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss unless they are\ndesignated  as  hedges.    The  Group  designates  financial  liabilities,  other  than  those\nclassified as held for trading, as measured at fair value through profit or loss at initial\nrecognition under one of the following situations:\n\n\xef\x82\xb7 Such  designation  eliminates  or  significantly  reduces  a  measurement  or  recognition\ninconsistency  that  would  otherwise  arise  from  measuring  assets  or  liabilities  or\nrecognizing the gains and losses on them on a different basis;\n\n\xef\x82\xb7 Performance of the financial liabilities is evaluated on a fair value basis; \n\xef\x82\xb7 A hybrid instrument contains one or more embedded derivatives.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n35\n\nAt  initial  recognition,  the  financial  liability  is  recognized  at  fair  value,  and  any\nattributable  transaction  costs  are  recognized  in  profit  or  loss  as  incurred.  Subsequent\nchanges that are measured at fair value, which take into account any interest expense, are\nrecognized in profit or loss and included in non-operating income and loss.\n\n3)\n\nFinancial liabilities measured at amortized cost\n\nFinancial liabilities not classified as held for trading or not designated as at fair value\nthrough profit or loss, which comprise loans and borrowings, accounts payable, and other\npayables,  are  measured  at  fair  value  plus  any  directly  attributable  transaction  costs  at\ninitial  recognition.  Subsequent  to  initial  recognition,  these  financial  liabilities  are\nmeasured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. \n\n4)\n\nDerecognition of financial liabilities\n\nThe  Group  derecognizes  a  financial  liability  when  its  contractual  obligation  has  been\nfulfilled or cancelled, or has expired. The difference between the carrying amount of a\nfinancial liability derecognized and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets\ntransferred  or  liabilities  assumed)  is  recognized  in  profit  or  loss  and  included  in  non-\noperating income and loss.\n\n5)\n\nOffsetting of financial assets and liabilities \n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are presented on a net basis only when the Group has the\nlegally enforceable right to offset and intends to settle such financial assets and liabilities\non a net basis or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.\n\n(iv) Derivative  financial  instruments  and  hedge  accounting  (applicable  commencing  January  1,\n\n2018) \n\nThe Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency and interest rate\nexposures. Derivatives are initially measured at fair value. Any attributable transaction costs\nthereof  are  recognized  in  profit  or  loss  as  incurred.  Subsequent  to  initial  recognition,\nderivatives are measured at fair value, and changes therein are recognized in profit or loss and\nincluded  in  non-operating  income  and  loss,  unless  the  derivative  financial  instruments  are\ndesignated as effective hedging instruments, in which the timing of the recognition in profit or\nloss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship. If the valuation of a derivative instrument\nresults in a positive fair value, it is classified as a financial asset; otherwise, it is classified as a\nfinancial liability.\n\nEmbedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for separately if the\neconomic  characteristics  and  risks  of  the  host  contract  that  is  a  non-financial  asset  are  not\nclosely related to the embedded derivatives and the host contract is not measured at FVTPL.\n\nCertain derivatives are designated as either (i) hedges of the fair value of recognized assets or\nliabilities (fair value hedge) or (ii) hedges of highly probable forecast transactions (cash flow\nhedge).  The  Group  documents,  at  the  inception  of  the  transaction,  the  relationship  between\nhedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy\nfor  undertaking  various  hedging  transactions.  The  Group  also  documents  its  assessment  of\nwhether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n36\n\nin fair value or cash flows of hedged items.\n\nThe  Group  shall  discontinue  hedge  accounting  prospectively  only  when  the  hedging\nrelationship (or a part of a hedging relationship) ceases to meet the qualifying criteria (after\ntaking into account any rebalancing of the hedging relationship, if applicable). This includes\ninstances when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised. \n\n1)\n\nFair value hedge\n\nChanges in the fair value of a hedging instrument that is qualified as a fair value hedge\nare  recognized  in  profit  or  loss  (or  other  comprehensive  income,  if  the  hedging\ninstrument hedges an equity instrument measured at FVOCI). \n\n2)\n\nCash flow hedge\n\nWhen  a  derivative  is  designated  and  qualified  as  a  cash  flow  hedging  instrument,  the\neffective  portion  of  changes  in  the  fair  value  is  recognized  in  other  comprehensive\nincome and accumulated in \xe2\x80\x9cother equity \xe2\x80\x94gains (losses) on hedging instruments\xe2\x80\x9d, and\nis limited to the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item from inception of the\nhedge. Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized\nimmediately in profit or loss, and included in non-operating income and loss.\n\nAmounts  previously  recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income  and  accumulated  in\nequity  are  reclassified  to  profit  or  loss  in  the  same  periods  when  the  hedged  item  is\nrecognized in profit or loss, and are included in the same account in the statements of\ncomprehensive income as the hedged item.\n\n(v) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting (applicable before January 1, 2018) \n\nExcept for the following items, the Group applied the same accounting policies as applicable\ncommencing January 1, 2018. \n\nEmbedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for separately if the\neconomic characteristics and risk of the host contract are not closely related to the embedded\nderivatives and the host contract is not measured at FVTPL. \n\nFor all cash flow hedges including hedges of expected transactions recognized in non-financial\nassets  or  non-financial  liabilities,  amounts  previously  recognized  in  other  comprehensive\nincome, and accumulated in equity, are reclassified to profit or loss in the same periods when\nexpected cash flow of hedged items are recognized in profit or loss. In addition, for the cash\nflow  hedge  that  is  discontinuing  before  January  1,  2018,  changes  in  fair  value  of  forward\nposition are recognized in profit or loss. \n\n(h)\n\nInventories\n\nInventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Inventories are recorded at\nstandard cost and adjusted to approximate weighted-average cost at the end of the reporting period.\nNet realizable value represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less all\nestimated costs of completion and necessary selling expenses.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n37\n\n(i) Non-current assets held for sale\n\nNon-current  assets  or  disposal  groups  comprising  assets  and  liabilities  that  are  expected  to  be\nrecovered primarily through a sale transaction, rather than through continuing use, are reclassified as\nnon-current assets held for sale. Such non-current assets or disposal groups must be available for\nimmediate sale in their present condition, and the sale is highly probable within one year. \n\nImmediately before the initial classification of the non-current assets (or disposal groups) as held for\nsale, the carrying amount of the assets (or all the assets and liabilities in the group) is measured in\naccordance with the Group\xe2\x80\x99s applicable accounting policies. Thereafter, the assets are measured at\nthe  lower  of  their  carrying  amount  and  fair  value  less  costs  to  sell.  Any  impairment  loss  on  a\ndisposal group will first be allocated to goodwill, and then the remaining balance of impairment loss\nis allocated to assets and liabilities on a pro rata basis, except for the assets not within the scope of\nIAS 36 \xe2\x80\x93 Impairment of Assets. Such assets will continue to be measured in accordance with the\nGroup\xe2\x80\x99s accounting policies. Impairment losses for assets initially classified as held for sale and any\nsubsequent  gains  or  losses  on  remeasurement  are  recognized  in  profit  or  loss;  nevertheless,  the\nreversal gains are not recognized in excess of any cumulative impairment loss.\n\nIntangible  assets  and  property,  plant  and  equipment are no longer amortized or depreciated when\nthey are classified as held for sale. \n\n(j)\n\nInvestments accounted for using equity method\n\nInvestments accounted for using the equity method include investments in associates and interests in\njoint venture. \n\nAn  associate  is  an  entity  over  which  the  Group  has  significant  influence  and  that  is  neither  a\nsubsidiary nor a joint venture. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and\noperating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.\n\nA joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the Group and other parties that have joint control of\nthe  arrangement  have  rights  to  the  net  assets  of  the  joint  arrangement.  Joint  control  is  the\ncontractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about\nthe relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. \n\nThe operating results as well as assets and liabilities of associates and joint venture are incorporated\nin these consolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity\nmethod, an investment in an associate or a joint venture is initially recognized in the consolidated\nbalance sheet at cost, and adjusted thereafter, to recognize the Group\xe2\x80\x99s share of profit or loss and\nother  comprehensive  income  (loss)  of  the  associate  and  joint  venture,  as  well  as  the  distribution\nreceived. The Group also recognizes its share in the changes in the equities of associates and joint\nventure.\n\nAny excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group\xe2\x80\x99s share of the net fair value of the identifiable\nassets, liabilities, and contingent liabilities of an associate or a joint venture recognized at the date of\nacquisition,  is  recognized  as  goodwill,  which  is  included  within  the  carrying  amount  of  the\ninvestment. Any excess of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities\nand contingent liabilities over the cost of acquisition, after reassessment, is recognized immediately\nin profit or loss.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n38\n\nWhen  necessary,  the  entire  carrying  amount  of  the  investment  (including  goodwill)  is  tested  for\nimpairment as a single asset by comparing its recoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair\nvalue less costs to sell) with its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognized forms part of the\ncarrying amount of the investment. Any reversal of that impairment loss is recognized to the extent\nthat the recoverable amount of the investment subsequently increases.\n\nThe  Group  discontinues  the  use  of  equity  method  from  the  date  when  the  Group  ceases  to  have\nsignificant influence over an associate. When the Group retains an interest in the former associate,\nthe  Group  measures  the  retained  interest  at  fair  value  at  that  date.  The  difference  between  the\ncarrying amount of the associate at the date the equity method was discontinued, and the fair value\nof  any  retained  interest  and  any  proceeds  from  disposing  of  a  part  interest  in  the  associate,  is\nincluded in the determination of the gain or loss on disposal of the associate. In addition, the Group\nshall account for all amounts recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to that associate\non the same basis as would be required if the associate had directly disposed of the related assets or\nliabilities. If the Group\xe2\x80\x99s ownership interest in an associate is reduced as a result of disposal, with\nthe investment continues to be an associate, the Group should reclassify only a proportionate amount\nof the gain or loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income to profit or loss.\n\nWhen the Group subscribes to additional shares in an associate or a joint venture at a percentage\ndifferent  from  its  existing  ownership  percentage,  the  resulting  carrying  amount  of  the  investment\ndiffers from the amount of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s proportionate interest in the net assets of the associate or\njoint  venture.  The  Group  records  such  a  difference  as  an  adjustment  to  investments  with  the\ncorresponding amount charged or credited to capital surplus. If the Group\xe2\x80\x99s ownership interest is\nreduced  due  to  the  additional  subscription  to  the  shares  of  associate  or  joint  venture  by  other\ninvestors,  the  proportionate  amount  of  the  gains  or  losses  previously  recognized  in  other\ncomprehensive income in relation to that associate or joint venture shall be reclassified to profit or\nloss on the same basis as would be required if the associate or joint venture had directly disposed of\nthe related assets or liabilities.\n\nUnrealized profits resulting from transactions between the Group and an associate or joint venture\nare  eliminated  to  the  extent  of  the  Group\xe2\x80\x99 s  interest  in  the  associate  or  joint  venture.  Unrealized\nlosses on transactions with associates or joint venture are eliminated in the same way, except to the\nextent that the underlying asset is impaired.\n\nAdjustments  are  made  to  associates\xe2\x80\x99   and  joint  ventures\xe2\x80\x99   financial  statements  to  conform  to  the\naccounting polices applied by the Group. \n\n(k)\n\nProperty, plant and equipment \n\n(i)\n\nRecognition and measurement\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  are  measured  at  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation  and\naccumulated impairment losses. Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the\nacquisition of the asset and bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to\nbe capable of operating in the manner intended by management, the initial estimate of the costs\nof dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located, and any\nborrowing  cost  that  is  eligible  for  capitalization.  Purchased  software  that  is  integral  to  the\nfunctionality of the related equipment is capitalized as part of that equipment.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n39\n\nThe  gain  or  loss  arising  from  the  disposal  of  an  item  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  is\ndetermined  as  the  difference  between  the  net  disposal  proceeds,  if  any,  and  the  carrying\namount of the item, and is recognized as non-operating income and loss.\n\n(ii) Reclassification to investment property \n\nA property is reclassified to investment property at its carrying amount when the purpose of\nthe property changes from owner-occupied to investment.  \n\n(iii) Subsequent costs\n\nSubsequent  costs  are  capitalized  only  when  it  is  probable  that  future  economic  benefits\nassociated  with  the  costs  will  flow  to  the  Group  and  the  cost  of  the  item  can  be  measured\nreliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized in profit and loss. All other\nrepairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred.\n\n(iv) Depreciation\n\nDepreciation is calculated on the cost of assets less their residual values and is recognized on a\nstraight  line  basis  over  the  estimated  useful  lives.  When  an  item  of  property,  plant  and\nequipment  comprises  significant  individual  components  for  which  different  depreciation\nmethods or useful lives are appropriate, each component is depreciated separately. Land is not\ndepreciated. The depreciation is recognized in profit or loss.\n\nThe estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment for the current and comparative\nperiods are as follows: buildings\xef\xbc\x8dmain structure - 30 to 50 years; air-conditioning system - 10\nyears;  other  equipment  pertaining  to  buildings  -  20  years;  computer  and  communication\nequipment - 2 to 5 years; and other equipment - 3 to 10 years.\n\nDepreciation  methods,  useful  lives,  and  residual  values  are reviewed at each financial year-\nend, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis. \n\n(l)\n\nInvestment property\n\nInvestment property is property held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or for\nboth, but not for use in the ordinary course of business or for administrative purposes. Investment\nproperty  is  measured  at  cost  on  initial  recognition.  Subsequent  to  initial  recognition,  investment\nproperty  is  measured  at  initial  acquisition  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  accumulated\nimpairment losses. The methods for depreciating and determining the useful life and residual value\nof investment property are the same as those adopted for property, plant and equipment. \n\nCost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the investment property,\nbringing the investment property to the condition necessary for intended use, and any borrowing cost\nthat is eligible for capitalization.\n\nAn investment property is reclassified to property, plant and equipment at its carrying amount when\nthe purpose of the investment property has been changed from investment to owner-occupied.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n40\n\n(m) Leases\n\nLeases  are  classified  as  finance  leases  when  the  Group  assumes  substantially  all  the  risks  and\nrewards incidental to ownership of the assets. All other leases are classified as operating leases.\n\n(i)\n\nThe Group as lessor\n\nLease income from an operating lease is recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis\nover the lease term. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease\nare added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognized as expense over the lease\nterm on a straight-line basis. Incentives granted to the lessee to enter into the operating lease\nare  recognized  as  a  reduction  of  rental  income  over  the  lease  term  on  a  straight-line  basis.\nContingent  rents  are  recognized  as  income  in  the  period  when  the  lease  adjustments  are\nconfirmed.\n\n(ii) The Group as lessee \n\nPayments  made  under  operating  leases  (excluding  insurance  and  maintenance  expenses)  are\ncharged to expense over the lease term on a straight-line basis. Lease incentives received from\nthe lessor are recognized as a reduction of rental expense over the lease term on a straight-line\nbasis. Contingent rents are recognized as expense in the period when the lease adjustments are\nconfirmed.\n\n(n)\n\nIntangible assets\n\n(i) Goodwill\n\nGoodwill arising from acquisitions of subsidiaries is accounted for as intangible assets. Refer\nto note 4(v) for the description of the measurement of goodwill at initial recognition.  Goodwill\narising  from  acquisitions  of  associates  is  included  in  the  carrying  amount  of  investments in\nassociates.  Goodwill  is  not  amortized  but  is  measured  at  cost  less  accumulated  impairment\nlosses.\n\n(ii) Trademarks\n\nTrademarks acquired in a business combination are measured at fair value at the acquisition\ndate. Subsequent to the initial recognition, trademarks with definite useful lives are carried at\ncost  less  accumulated  amortization  and  accumulated  impairment  losses.  Amortization  is\nrecognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of 7 years. Trademarks with\nindefinite useful lives are carried at cost less any accumulated impairment losses and are tested\nfor impairment annually. The useful life of an intangible asset not subject to amortization is\nreviewed annually at each financial year-end to determine whether events and circumstances\ncontinue to support an indefinite useful life assessment for the asset. Any change in the useful\nlife assessment from indefinite to definite is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n41\n\n(iii) Other intangible assets\n\nOther separately acquired intangible assets are carried at cost or fair value at the acquisition\ndate,  less  accumulated  amortization  and  accumulated  impairment  losses.  Amortization  is\nrecognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the following estimated useful lives:\ncustomer relationships - 7 to 10 years; developed technology - 10 years; channel resources -\n8.8 years; developing technology - 15 years; patents - 4 to 15 years; acquired software - 1 to 3\nyears.\n\nThe residual value, amortization period, and amortization method are reviewed at least at each\nfinancial year-end, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective\nbasis.\n\n(o)\n\nImpairment of non-financial assets\n\n(i) Goodwill \n\nFor  the  purpose  of  impairment  testing,  goodwill  arising  from  a  business  combination  is\nallocated  to  each  of  the  Group\xe2\x80\x99 s  cash-generating  units  (CGUs)  that  are  expected  to  benefit\nfrom the synergies of the combination. The CGUs with goodwill are tested annually (or when\nthere  are  indications  that  a  CGU  may  have  been  impaired)  for  impairment.  When  the\nrecoverable amount of a CGU is less than the carrying amount of the CGU, the impairment\nloss  is  recognized  firstly  by  reducing  the  carrying  amount  of  any  goodwill  allocated  to  the\nCGU  and  then  proportionately  allocated  to  the  other  assets  of  the  CGU  on  the  basis  of  the\ncarrying amount of each asset in the CGU. Any impairment loss is recognized immediately in\nprofit or loss. A subsequent reversal of the impairment loss on goodwill is prohibited.\n\n(ii) Other tangible and intangible assets \n\nNon-financial  assets  other  than  inventories,  deferred  income  tax  assets,  assets  arising  from\nemployee benefits, and non-current assets held for sale are reviewed for impairment at each\nreporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. When there exists\nan indication of impairment for an asset, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated. If\nthe recoverable amount of an individual asset cannot be determined, the Group estimates the\nrecoverable amount of the CGU to which the asset has been allocated. \n\nThe recoverable amount for an individual asset or a CGU is the higher of its fair value less\ncosts to sell or its value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are\ndiscounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the evaluation of\ncurrent market on the time values of money and on the risks specific to the asset. When the\nrecoverable amount of an asset or a CGU is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount\nof the asset or CGU is reduced to its recoverable amount, and an impairment loss is recognized\nin profit or loss immediately. \n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n42\n\nThe Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any evidence that an impairment\nloss recognized in prior periods for an asset other than goodwill may no longer exist or may\nhave decreased.  If so, an impairment loss recognized in prior periods for an asset other than\ngoodwill is reversed, and the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is increased to its revised\nestimate of recoverable amount. The increased carrying amount shall not exceed the carrying\namount  (net  of  amortization  or  depreciation)  that  would  have  been  determined  had  no\nimpairment loss been recognized in prior years.\n\nIntangible  assets  with  indefinite  useful  lives  or  those  not  yet  available  for  use  are  tested\nannually  for  impairment.  An  impairment  loss  is  recognized  for  the  excess  of  the  asset\xe2\x80\x99 s\ncarrying amount over its recoverable amount.\n\n(p)\n\nProvisions\n\nProvisions are recognized when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result\nof a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable\nestimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.\n\n(i) Warranties\n\nA provision for warranties is recognized when the underlying products or services are sold.\nThis  provision  reflects  the  historical  warranty  claim  rate  and  the  weighting  of  all  possible\noutcomes against their associated probabilities.\n\n(ii) Sales return provision\n\nA  provision  for  sales  returns  is  recognized  when  the  underlying  products  are  sold.  This\nprovision is estimated based on historical sales return data.\n\n(iii) Others\n\nProvisions for litigation claims and environmental restoration are recognized when the Group\nhas a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the\nGroup  will  be  required  to  settle  the  obligation,  and  a  reliable  estimate  can  be  made  of  the\namount of the obligation.\n\n(q) Treasury stock\n\nCommon  stock  repurchased  by  the  Group  treated  as  treasury  stock  (a  contra-equity  account)  is\nreported at acquisition cost (including all directly accountable costs).  When treasury stock is sold,\nthe excess of sales proceeds over cost is accounted for as capital surplus\xef\xbc\x8dtreasury stock.  If the\nsales  proceeds  are  less  than  cost,  the  deficiency  is  accounted  for  as a reduction of the remaining\nbalance  of  capital  surplus\xef\xbc\x8d treasury  stock.  If  the  remaining  balance  of  capital  surplus\xef\xbc\x8d treasury\nstock  is  insufficient  to  cover  the  deficiency,  the  remainder  is  recorded  as  a  reduction  of  retained\nearnings. The cost of treasury stock is computed using the weighted-average cost of different types\nof repurchase.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n43\n\nIf  treasury  stock  is  retired,  the  weighted-average  cost  of  the  retired  treasury  stock  is  written  off\nagainst the par value and the capital surplus premium, if any, of the stock retired on a pro rata basis.\nIf the weighted-average cost written off exceeds the sum of the par value and the capital surplus, the\ndifference  is  accounted  for  as  a  reduction  of  capital  surplus\xef\xbc\x8d treasury  stock,  or  a  reduction  of\nretained earnings for any deficiency where capital surplus\xef\xbc\x8dtreasury stock is insufficient to cover the\ndifference. If the weighted-average cost written off is less than the sum of the par value and capital\nsurplus, if any, of the stock retired, the difference is accounted for as an increase in capital surplus\xef\xbc\x8d\ntreasury stock.\n\n(r) Revenue recognition \n\n(i)\n\nRevenue from contracts with customers (applicable commencing January 1, 2018)\n\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration to which the Group expects to be entitled in\nexchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. The Group recognizes revenue when\nit  satisfies  a  performance  obligation  by  transferring  control  of  a  good  or  a  service  to  a\ncustomer. The accounting policies for the Group\xe2\x80\x99s main types of revenue are explained below.\n\n1)\n\nSale of goods\n\nThe Group recognizes revenue when control of the products has been transferred, being\nwhen the products are delivered to the customer, the customer has full discretion over the\nchannel and price to sell the products, and there is no unfulfilled obligation that could\naffect the customer\xe2\x80\x99s acceptance of the products. Delivery occurs when the products have\nbeen  shipped  to  the  specific  location,  the  risks  of  obsolescence  and  loss  have  been\ntransferred  to  the  customer,  and  either  the  customer  has  accepted  the  products  in\naccordance with the sales contract, the acceptance provisions have lapsed, or the Group\nhas objective evidence that all criteria for acceptance have been satisfied.\n\nThe  Group  recognizes  revenue  based  on  the  price  specified  in  the  contract, net of the\nestimated volume discounts and rebates. Accumulated experience is used to estimate the\ndiscounts and rebates using the expected value method, and revenue is only recognized to\nthe extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. A refund\nliability  is  recognized  for  expected  sales  discounts  and rebate payable to customers in\nrelation to sales made until the end of the reporting period. No element of financing is\ndeemed  present  as  the  sales  are  made  with  a  credit  term  ranged  from  30  to  90  days,\nwhich is consistent with the market practice.\n\nSome  subsidiaries  of  the  Group  grant  their  customers  the  right  to  return  the  products\nwithin 90 days. Therefore, they reduce revenue by the amount of expected returns and\nrecognize a refund liability and a right to the returned goods. Accumulated experience is\nused  to  estimate  such  returns  at  the  time  of  sale.  At  each  reporting  date,  the  Group\nreassesses the estimated amount of expected returns.\n\nThe Group\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to provide a refund for faulty goods under the standard warranty\nterms  is  recognized  as  a  provision  for  warranty.  Please  refer  to  note  6(s)  for  more\nexplanation.\n\nA receivable is recognized when the goods are delivered as this is the point in time that\nthe Group has a right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n44\n\n2)\n\nRevenue from service rendered\n\nThe  Group  provides  system  implementation  or  integration  services  to  enterprise\ncustomers. Revenue from providing services is recognized in the accounting periods in\nwhich the services are rendered. For performance obligations that are satisfied over time,\nrevenue is recognized based on the actual service provided to the end of the reporting\nperiod  as  a  proportion  of the total services to be provided. The proportion of services\nprovided is determined based on the portion of the work performed, the time passed by,\nor the milestone reached. \n\nEstimates  of  revenues,  costs,  or  extent  of  progress  toward  completion,  are  revised  if\ncircumstances  change.  Any  resulting  increases  or  decreases  in  estimated  revenues  or\ncosts are reflected in profit or loss in the period in which the circumstances that give rise\nto the revision become known by the management.\n\nIn case of fixed-price contracts, the customer pays the fixed amount based on a payment\nschedule. If the accumulated revenue recognized by the Group exceed the payments, a\ncontract asset is recognized. If the payments exceed the accumulated revenue recognized,\na contract liability is recognized.\n\n3)\n\nFinancing components\n\nThe Group does not expect to have any contracts where the period between the transfer\nof  the  promised  goods  or  services  to  the  customer  and  the  payment  by  the  customer\nexceeds one year. As a consequence, the Group does not adjust any of the transaction\nprices for the time value of money. \n\n(ii) Revenue recognition (applicable before January 1, 2018)\n\nRevenue  from  the  sale  of  goods  or  services  is  measured  at  the  fair  value  of  consideration\nreceived or receivable, net of returns, rebates, and other similar discounts.\n\n1)\n\nSale of goods\n\nRevenue  from  the  sale  of  goods  is  recognized  when  all  the  following  conditions  have\nbeen satisfied: (a) the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been\ntransferred to the buyer; (b) the Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement\nto the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold;\n(c) the amount of revenue can be measured reliably; (d) it is probable that the economic\nbenefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group; and (e) the cost incurred\nor to be incurred, in respect of the transaction, can be measured reliably. \n\nThe timing of the transfers of risks and rewards varies depending on the individual terms\nof the sales agreement. Revenue is not recognized for the sale of key components to an\noriginal  design  manufacturer  for  manufacture  or  assembly  as  the  significant  risks  and\nrewards of the ownership of materials are not transferred.\n\nRevenue from extended warranty contracts is deferred and amortized as earned over the\ncontract period, ranging from one to three years.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n45\n\n2)\n\nServices\n\nRevenue from services rendered is recognized by reference to the stage of completion at\nthe reporting date.\n\n3)\n\nRental income, interest income, and dividend income\n\nRental income from investment property is recognized over the lease term on a straight-\nline basis. \n\nDividend income from investments is recognized when the shareholder\xe2\x80\x99s right to receive\npayment has been established, provided that it is probable that the economic benefits will\nflow to the Group and the amount of income can be measured reliably. \n\nInterest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and\nat the effective interest rate applicable.\n\n(iii) Contract costs (applicable commencing January 1, 2018)\n\n1)\n\nIncremental costs of obtaining a contract\n\nThe Group recognizes the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer as an\nasset if the Group expects to recover those costs. The incremental costs of obtaining a\ncontract are those costs that the Group incurs to obtain a contract with a customer that it\nwould not have incurred if the contract had not been obtained. Costs to obtain a contract\nthat would have been incurred, regardless of whether the contract was obtained, shall be\nrecognized as an expense when incurred, unless those costs are explicitly chargeable to\nthe customer regardless of whether the contract is obtained.\n\nThe Group applies the practical expedient to recognize the incremental costs of obtaining\na contract as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset that the\nGroup otherwise would have recognized is one year or less.\n\n2)\n\nCosts to fulfil a contract\n\nIf the costs incurred in fulfilling a contract with a customer are not within the scope of\nanother Standard (e.g., IAS 2 Inventories, IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment or IAS\n38 Intangible Assets), the Group recognizes an asset from the costs incurred to fulfil a\ncontract only if those costs meet all of the following criteria:\n\n\xef\x82\xb7 the costs relate directly to a contract or to an anticipated contract that the Group can\n\nspecifically identify;\n\n\xef\x82\xb7 the costs generate or enhance resources of the Group that will be used in satisfying (or\n\nin continuing to satisfy) performance obligations in the future; and\n\n\xef\x82\xb7 the costs are expected to be recovered.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0c46\n\nACER INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nGeneral and administrative costs, costs of wasted materials, labor or other resources to\nfulfil the contract that were not reflected in the price of the contract, costs that relate to\nsatisfied  performance  obligations  (or  partially  satisfied  performance  obligations),  and\ncosts  for  which  the  Group  cannot  distinguish  whether  the  costs  relate  to  unsatisfied\nperformance  obligations  or  to  satisfied  performance  obligations  (or  partially  satisfied\nperformance obligations) are recognized as expenses when incurred.\n\n(s)\n\nEmployee benefits \n\n(i) Defined contribution plans\n\nObligations  for  contributions  to  defined  contribution  pension  plans  are  expensed  during  the\nyear in which employees render services.\n\n(ii) Defined benefit plans\n\nThe liability recognized in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the\ndefined benefit obligation at the reporting date less the fair value of plan assets. The discount\nrate for calculating the present value of the defined benefit obligation refers to the interest rate\nof high-quality government bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits\nwill be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating the terms of the related pension\nobligation.\n\nThe defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by qualified actuaries using the projected\nunit credit method. When the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the recognized asset\nis limited to the total amount of the present value of the economic benefits available in the\nform of refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan.  The minimum\nfunding requirements of any plans applicable to the Group should be taken into consideration\nwhen determining the present value of the economic benefits. An economic benefit is available\nto  the  Group  if  it  is  realizable  during  the  life  of  the  plan  or  upon  settlement  of  the  plan\nliabilities.\n\nWhen the benefits of a plan are improved, the expenses related to the increased obligations\nresulting from the services rendered by employees in the past years are recognized in profit or\nloss immediately.\n\nThe remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability (asset) comprise (i) actuarial gains and\nlosses; (ii) return on plan assets, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined\nbenefit  liability  (asset);  and  (iii)  any  change  in  the  effect  of  the  asset  ceiling,  excluding\namounts  included  in  net  interest  on  the  net  defined  benefit  liability  (asset).  The\nremeasurements  of  the  net  defined  benefit  liability  (asset)  are  recognized  in  other\ncomprehensive income and reflected in other equity.\n\nThe Group recognizes gains or losses on the curtailment or settlement of a defined benefit plan\nwhen  the  curtailment  or  settlement  occurs.  The  gain  or  loss  on  curtailment  or  settlement\ncomprises any resulting change in the fair value of plan assets and any change in the present\nvalue of the defined benefit obligation. \n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n47\n\n(iii) Short-term employee benefits\n\nShort-term  employee  benefit  obligations  are  measured  on  an  undiscounted  basis  and  are\nexpensed during the period in which employees render services.  A liability is recognized for\nthe  amount  expected  to  be  paid  under  short-term  cash  bonus  or  profit-sharing  plans  if  the\nGroup has a present legal or constructive obligation to make such payments as a result of past\nservice provided by the employees, and the obligation can be estimated reliably.\n\n(t)\n\nShare-based payment\n\nShare-based payment awards granted to employees are measured at fair value at the date of grant.\nThe fair value determined at the grant date is expensed over the period that the employees become\nunconditionally entitled to the awards, with a corresponding increase in equity. The compensation\ncost is adjusted to reflect the number of awards given to employees for which the performance and\nnon-market conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognized shall be\nbased on the number of equity instruments that eventually vested. \n\nThe grant date of options for employees to subscribe new shares for a cash injection is the date when\nthe Board of Directors approves the exercise price and the shares to which employees can subscribe. \n\n(u) Government grant\n\nA government grant is recognized in profit or loss only when there is reasonable assurance that the\nGroup will comply with the conditions attached to it and that the grant will be received.\n\nA  government  grant  that  becomes  receivable  as  compensation  for  expenses  or  losses  already\nincurred or for the purpose of giving immediate financial support to the Group with no future related\ncosts is recognized in profit or loss in the period in which it becomes receivable.\n\nGovernment grant is recognized in other gains and losses.\n\n(v)\n\nIncome taxes \n\nIncome tax expenses include both current taxes and deferred taxes. Current and deferred taxes are\nrecognized in profit or loss unless they relate to business combinations or items recognized directly\nin equity or other comprehensive income.\n\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using\ntax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustments to tax payable in\nrespect of previous years.\n\nDeferred  income  taxes  are  recognized  in  respect  of  temporary  differences  between  the  carrying\namounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation\npurposes.  Deferred taxes are not recognized for:\n\n(i)\n\nTemporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is\nnot a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;\n\n(ii) Temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures to the extent\nthat the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences, and it\nis probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and\n\n(iii) Temporary differences arising from initial recognition of goodwill.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n48\n\nDeferred  tax  assets  are  recognized  for  unused  tax  losses,  tax  credits,  and  deductible  temporary\ndifferences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which\nthey  can  be  utilized.    Deferred  tax  assets  are  reviewed  at  each  reporting  date  and  reduced  to  the\nextent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized.\n\nDeferred tax is measured based on the expected manner of realization or settlement of the carrying\namount of the assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting\ndate.\n\nDeferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  are  offset  when  where  is  a  legally  enforceable  right  to  offset\ncurrent tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate\nto income taxes levied by the same tax authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable\nentities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.\n\n(w) Business combinations\n\nGoodwill  is measured as the excess of the acquisition-date fair value of consideration transferred\n(including any non-controlling interest in the acquiree) over the net of the acquisition-date amounts\nof  the  identifiable  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  (generally  at  fair  value).  If  the residual\nbalance  is  negative,  the  Group  shall  reassess  whether  it  has  correctly  identified  all  of  the  assets\nacquired and liabilities assumed and recognize any additional assets or liabilities that are identified\nin that review, and shall recognize a gain on the bargain purchase thereafter.\n\nAcquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred except for the costs related to issuance of debt or\nequity instruments.\n\nFor  each  business  combination,  non-controlling  interest  in  the  acquiree  is  measured  either  at  fair\nvalue  or  at  the  non-controlling  interest\xe2\x80\x99 s  proportionate  share  of  the  fair  value  of  the  acquiree\xe2\x80\x99 s\nidentifiable net assets.\n\nIn a business combination achieved in stages, the Group shall remeasure its previously held equity\ninterest in the acquiree at its acquisition-date fair value and recognize the resulting gain or loss in\nprofit or loss. The amount previously recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to the\nchanges in the value of the Group\xe2\x80\x99s equity interest should be reclassified to profit or loss on the\nsame basis as would be required if the Group had disposed directly of the previously held equity\ninterest.\n\nIf the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period\nin  which  the  combination  occurs,  provisional  amounts  for  the  items  for  which  the  accounting  is\nincomplete are reported in the financial statements. During the measurement period, the provisional\namounts recognized at the acquisition date are retrospectively adjusted to reflect new information\nobtained  about  facts  and  circumstances  that  existed  as  of  the  acquisition  date.  The  measurement\nperiod shall not exceed one year from the acquisition date.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n49\n\n(x) Earnings per share (\xe2\x80\x9cEPS\xe2\x80\x9d)\n\nThe  basic  and  diluted  EPS  attributable  to  stockholders  of  the  Company  are  disclosed  in  the\nconsolidated  financial  statements.  Basic  EPS  is  calculated  by  dividing  net  income  attributable  to\nstockholders of the Company by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during\nthe year.  In calculating diluted EPS, the net income attributable to stockholders of the Company and\nweighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the year are adjusted for the effects\nof  dilutive  potential  common  shares.  The  Group\xe2\x80\x99 s  dilutive  potential  common  shares  include\nrestricted shares of stock issued to employees and profit sharing for employees to be settled in the\nform of common stock.\n\n(y) Operating segments\n\nAn operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it\nmay earn revenues and incur expenses (including revenues and expenses relating to transactions with\nother components of the Group). Operating results of the operating segment are regularly reviewed\nby the Group\xe2\x80\x99s chief operating decision maker, who decides on the allocation of resources to the\nsegment and assesses its performance for which discrete financial information is available.\n\n5.\n\nCritical Accounting Judgments and Key Sources of Estimation and Assumption Uncertainty\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with the Regulations and Taiwan-\nIFRSs requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of\nthe accounting policies and the reported amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results\nmay differ from these estimates.\n\nThe  estimates  and  underlying  assumptions  are reviewed on an ongoing basis.  Revisions to accounting\nestimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised and in the future periods affected.\n\nInformation about assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting in a\nmaterial adjustment within the next financial year is included as follows:\n\n(a) Revenue recognition (accrual of sales return and allowance)\n\nThe  Group  recognizes  revenue  when  the earning process is completed. The Group also records a\nprovision for estimated future returns and other allowances in the same period the related revenue is\nrecorded. Provision for estimated sales returns and other allowances is generally made and adjusted\nbased on historical experience, market and economic conditions, and any other known factors that\nwould significantly affect the allowance. The adequacy of estimations is reviewed periodically. The\nfierce market competition and rapid evolution of technology could result in significant adjustments\nto the provision made.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n50\n\n(b) Valuation of inventory\n\nInventories are measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  The Group uses judgment and\nestimates to determine the net realizable value of inventory at each reporting date.\n\nDue to rapid technological changes, the Group estimates the net realizable value of inventory, taking\nobsolescence and unmarketable items into account at the reporting date, and then writes down the\ncost  of  inventories  to  net  realizable  value.  The  net  realizable  value  of  the  inventory  is  mainly\ndetermined  based  on  assumptions  of  future  demand  within  a  specific  time  horizon,  which  could\nresult in significant adjustments.Refer to note 6(h) for further description of inventory write-downs.\n\n(c)\n\nImpairment of goodwill\n\nThe  assessment  of  impairment  of  goodwill  requires  the  Group  to  make  subjective  judgments  to\nidentify cash-generating units, allocate the goodwill to relevant cash-generating units, and estimate\nthe recoverable amount of relevant cash-generating units. Any changes in these estimates based on\nchanged economic conditions or business strategies could result in significant adjustments in future\nyears.

The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk\nexposures within acceptable parameters, while optimizing the return.\n\nThe Group utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage market risk and the volatility of\nprofit or loss.  All such transactions are carried out within the guidelines set by the Board of\nDirectors. \n\n1)\n\nForeign currency risk\n\nThe  Group  is  exposed  to  foreign  currency  risk  on  sales  and  purchases  that  are\ndenominated in a currency other than the respective functional currencies of the Group\nentities.  The  foreign  currencies  used  in  these  transactions  are  mainly  the  US  dollar\n(USD),  Euro  (EUR),  Great  British  Pound  (GBP),  Australian  Dollar  (AUD),  Russian\nRuble (RUB), Indian Rupee (INR), etc.\n\nThe  Group  utilizes  foreign  currency  forward  contracts  to  hedge  its  foreign  currency\nexposure with respect to its forecast sales and purchases over the following 12 months.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0c97\n\nACER INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\na)\n\nExposure to foreign currency risk and sensitivity analysis\n\nThe  Group\xe2\x80\x99 s  exposure  to  foreign  currency  risk  arises  from  cash  and  cash\nequivalents,  notes  and  accounts  receivable  (including  related-party  receivables),\nnotes  and  accounts  payable  (including  related-party  payables),  other  receivables\n(including  related-party  receivables)  and  other  payables  that  are  denominated  in\nforeign  currency.

To  manage  the  interest  rate  risk,  the  Group  periodically\nassesses the interest rates of bank loans and maintains good relationships with financial\ninstitutions to obtain lower financing costs.  The Group also strengthens the management\nof  working  capital  to  reduce  the  dependence  on bank loans as well as the risk arising\nfrom fluctuation of interest rates.\n\nThe following sensitivity analysis is based on the risk exposure to floating-interest-rate\nliabilities on the reporting date. The sensitivity analysis assumes the liabilities recorded\nat the reporting date had been outstanding for the entire period.  The change in interest\nrate  reported  to  the  key  management  in  the  Group  is  based  on 100 basis points (1%),\nwhich is consistent with the assessment made by the key management in respect of the\npossible change in interest rate.\n\nIf the interest rate had been 100 basis points (1%) higher/lower with all other variables\nheld constant, pre-tax income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nwould have been $39,771 and $64,854, respectively, lower/higher, which mainly resulted\nfrom the borrowings with floating interest rates.\n\n3)\n\nOther market price risk\n\nThe Group is exposed to the risk of price fluctuation in securities market resulting from\nits  investment  in  publicly  traded  stocks.  The  Group  supervises  the  equity  price  risk\nactively  and  manages  the  risk  based  on  fair  value.  The  Group  also  has  strategic\ninvestments in privately held stocks, in which the Group does not actively participate in\ntheir trading. \n\nAssuming  a  hypothetical  increase  or  decrease  of  5%  in  equity  prices  of  the  equity\ninvestments at each reporting date, the other comprehensive income for the years ended\nDecember  31,  2018  and  2017,  would  have  increased  or  decreased  by  $221,472  and\n$268,534, respectively.\n\n(ag) Capital management\n\nIn consideration of the industry dynamics and future developments, as well as external environment\nfactors, the Group maintains an optimal capital structure to enhance long-term shareholder value by\nmanaging its capital in a manner to ensure that it has sufficient and necessary financial resources to\nfund its working capital needs, research and development activities, dividend payments, and other\nbusiness  requirements  for  continuing  operations  and  to  reward  shareholders  and  take  into\nconsideration the interests of other stakeholders.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n(ah) Changes in liabilities from financing activities\n\nThe reconciliation of liabilities arising from financing activities was as follows:\n\nLong-term debt\nShort-term borrowings\nTotal liabilities from\nfinancing activities\n\n$\n\n$\n\nJanuary 1,\n\n2018\n6,002,457\n482,894\n\nCash flows\n\n(2,681,440)\n98,492\n\n6,485,351\n\n(2,582,948)\n\n7.

The  IT  Hardware  Products  engages  mainly  in  the  research,  design,  and\nmarketing of personal computers, IT products, and tablet products. Other business groups, which do\nnot meet the quantitative reporting threshold, mainly engage in the activities of e-commerce, cloud\nservices,  sales  and  distribution  of  smart  devices,  IT  products,  new  energy  devices,  and  handheld\ndevices, as well as real estate services.\n\nStrategic investment expenditures (such as global branding expenditures, depreciation of the capital\nexpenditures  for  the  strengthening  of  the  global  information  structure,  and  non-routine  long-term\nstrategic  expenditures)  are  not  allocated  to  reportable  segments.  Operating  profit  is  used  as  the\nmeasurement for segment profit and the basis for performance evaluation. The reporting amount is\nconsistent  with  the  report  used  by  the  chief  operating  decision  maker.  There  was  no  material\ninconsistency between the accounting policies adopted for the operating segments and the significant\naccounting policies of the Group.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER

The Company aims at the integrated applications of Internet\nof  Things  (IoT)  and  service-oriented  technology  in  the  future  to  provide  more  products  and  integrated\napplications combining software, hardware and service for consumer and commercial markets.\n\n2.

(\xe2\x80\x9cFSC\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\nIn preparing the accompanying parent-company-only financial statements, the Company has adopted\nthe  following  International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (\xe2\x80\x9c IFRS\xe2\x80\x9d ),  International  Accounting\nStandards  (\xe2\x80\x9c IAS\xe2\x80\x9d ),  and  Interpretations  that  have  been  issued  by  the  International  Accounting\nStandards Board (\xe2\x80\x9c IASB\xe2\x80\x9d) (collectively, \xe2\x80\x9c IFRSs\xe2\x80\x9d) and endorsed by the FSC, with effective date\nfrom January 1, 2018.\n\nNew, Revised or Amended Standards and Interpretations\n\nAmendment to IFRS 2 Classification and Measurement of Share-based Payment\n\nTransactions\n\nEffective date\n\nper IASB\n\nJanuary 1, 2018\n\nAmendments to IFRS 4 Applying IFRS 9 Financial Instruments with IFRS 4\n\nInsurance Contracts\n\nIFRS 9 Financial Instruments\nIFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers\nAmendment to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows\xe2\x80\x94Disclosure Initiative\nAmendment to IAS 12 Income Taxes\xe2\x80\x94Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for\n\nUnrealized Losses\n\nAmendments to IAS 40 Transfers of Investment Property\nAnnual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2014\xe2\x80\x932016 Cycle:\n\nAmendments to IFRS 12\nAmendments to IFRS 1 and Amendments to IAS 28\n\nJanuary 1, 2018\n\nJanuary 1, 2018\nJanuary 1, 2018\nJanuary 1, 2017\nJanuary 1, 2017\n\nJanuary 1, 2018\n\nJanuary 1, 2017\nJanuary 1, 2018\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0c9\n\nACER INCORPORATED\n\nNotes to Parent-Company-Only Financial Statements\n\nNew, Revised or Amended Standards and Interpretations\nIFRIC 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration\n\nEffective date\n\nper IASB\n\nJanuary 1, 2018\n\nExcept for the following items, the initial application of the above IFRSs did not have any material\nimpact on the parent-company-only\xe2\x80\x99s financial statements. The extent and impact of changes are as\nfollows:\n\n(i)\n\nIFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers\n\nIFRS 15 establishes a five-step model framework to determine the method, timing and amount\nof  revenue  recognized.  This  Standard  replaces  the  existing  revenue  recognition  guidance,\nincluding IAS 18 Revenue, IAS 11 Construction Contracts and the related interpretations. The\nCompany applies this standard retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying\nthis Standard recognized at the date of initial application. The Company elected not to restate\nthe comparative information for the prior reporting period; but instead, continues to apply IAS\n11,  IAS  18  and  the  related  Interpretations  for  comparative  reporting  period.  The  Company\nrecognizes the cumulative effect upon the initial application of this Standard as an adjustment\nto the opening balance of its retained earnings on January 1, 2018.\n\nThe  Company  uses  the  practical  expedients  for  completed  contracts,  meaning,  it  need  not\nrestate those contracts that have been completed on January 1, 2018.\n\nThe following are the nature and impacts on the changes of accounting policies:\n\nUnder IAS 18, revenue for the sale of goods was recognized when the related significant risks\nand rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred to the customers, the revenue and\nthe  cost  incurred,  or  to  be  incurred,  can  be  measured reliably, the economic benefits of the\ntransaction  will  probably  flow  to  the  Company,  and  there  is  neither  continuing  managerial\ninvolvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effect control over the goods\nsold. Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of the goods.\n\nFor certain contracts that give customers rebates or marketing support, revenue is recognized\nunder  IAS  18  when  relevant  allowance  could  be  reasonably  estimated  and  all  revenue\nrecognition criteria were met. Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognized for these contracts to the\nextent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue\nrecognized  will  not  occur.  A  refund  liability  will  be  recognized  for  the  estimated  sales\nallowance and presented separately in the statement of financial position.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED\n\nNotes to Parent-Company-Only Financial Statements\n\n10\n\n1)\n\nImpacts on financial statements\n\nThe  following  tables  summarize  the  impacts  of  adopting  IFRS15  on  the  Company\xe2\x80\x99 s \nparent-company-only financial statements.\n\nDecember 31, 2018\n\nBalance prior\n\nto the\n\nadoption of\nIFRS 15\n\n$\n\n3,436,721\n\nImpact of\nchanges in\naccounting\n\npolicies\n\n(84,450)\n\nBalance\nupon\n\nadoption of\nIFRS 15\n3,352,271\n\nBalance prior\n\nto the\n\nadoption of\nIFRS 15\n\n4,246,340\n\nImpacted line items on the \n\nbalance sheet\n\nNotes and accounts\nreceivable, net\n\nJanuary 1, 2018\nImpact of\nchanges in\naccounting\n\nBalance\nupon\n\npolicies\n\n-\n\nadoption of\nIFRS 15\nNote\n4,246,340 Note 1\n\nContract assets\xef\xbc\x8dcurrent\nImpact on assets\nOther payables\nContract liabilities\xef\xbc\x8dcurrent\nRefund  liabilities\xef\xbc\x8dcurrent\nContract liabilities\xef\xbc\x8dnon-current\nImpact on liabilities\n\n-\n\n$ (18,334,838)\n\n-\n-\n-\n\n84,450\n-\n\n3,226,193\n(122,994)\n(2,611,223)\n(491,976)\n\n-\n\n$\n\n$\n\n84,450\n\n-\n\n(15,108,645)\n(122,994)\n(2,611,223)\n(491,976)\n\n(17,226,533)\n\n-\n-\n-\n\n-\n-\n\n3,623,442\n(150,830)\n(2,869,290)\n(603,322)\n\n-\n\n-\n\nNote 1\n\n(13,603,091) Note 2\n(150,830) Note 1\n(2,869,290) Note 2\n(603,322) Note 1\n\nImpacted line items on the\n statement of cash flows\n\nCash flows from operating activities:\nIncome before income tax\nAdjustments:\nChanges in operating assets and\n\nliabilities:\nContract assets\nNotes and accounts receivable, net\nOther payables and other current\n\nliabilities\n\nRefund liabilities\nContract liabilities\n\nImpact on net cash flows provided by\n\n(used in) operating activities\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2018\n\nBalance prior\nto the adoption\n\nof IFRS 15\n\nImpact of\nchanges in\naccounting\n\npolices\n\nBalance upon\nadoption of\nIFRS 15\n\n$\n\n3,912,590\n\n-\n\n3,912,590\n\n-\n806,882\n1,162,721\n\n-\n-\n\n(84,450)\n84,450\n397,249\n\n(258,067)\n(139,182)\n\n(84,450)\n891,332\n1,559,970\n\n(258,067)\n(139,182)\n\n$\n\n-\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED\n\nNotes to Parent-Company-Only Financial Statements\n\n11\n\nNote  1:  For  certain  contracts,  the  Company  recognizes  revenue  when  it  satisfied a  performance\nobligation but does not have an unconditional right to the considerations. Under IFRS 15,\ncontract  assets  and  revenue  are  recognized  for  such  situation,  different  from  accounts\nreceivable and revenue that would be recognized prior to the adoption of IFRS 15. On the\nother hand, for certain contracts, the Company has received a part of the considerations\nbut does not satisfy its obligations. Under IFRS 15, contract liabilities are recognized for\nsuch situation, different from other payables recognized prior to the adoption of IFRS 15.\n\nNote 2: Prior to the adoption of IFRS 15, rebate payables were recognized under other payables.\n\nUnder IFRS 15, they are recognized under refund liabilities.\n\n(ii)\n\nIFRS 9 Financial Instruments\n\nIFRS 9 replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement which contains\nclassification and measurement of financial instruments, impairment, and hedge accounting.\n\nAs a result of the adoption of IFRS 9, the Company adopted the consequential amendments to\nIFRS  7  Financial  Instruments:  Disclosures  that  are  applied  to  disclosures  about  2018  but\ngenerally have not been applied to comparative information.\n\nThe details of new significant accounting policies and the nature and effect of the changes to\nIFRS 9 are as follows:\n\n1)\n\nClassification of financial assets and financial liabilities\n\nIFRS 9 contains three principal classification categories for financial assets: measured at\namortized  cost,  fair  value  through  other  comprehensive  income  (\xe2\x80\x9c FVOCI\xe2\x80\x9d ),  and  fair\nvalue through profit or loss (\xe2\x80\x9cFVTPL\xe2\x80\x9d). The classification of financial assets under IFRS\n9 is generally based on the business model in which financial assets are managed and\ntheir contractual cash flow characteristics. The standard eliminates the previous IAS 39\ncategories of held to maturity, loans and receivables and available-for-sale. Under IFRS\n9, if a hybrid contract contains a host that is within the scope of IFRS 9, the embedded\nderivatives  would  not  be  separated  from  the  host  contract;  instead,  the  entire  hybrid\ncontract is assessed for classification. Please refer to note 4(f) for an explanation of how\nthe Company classifies and measures its financial assets and accounts for related gains\nand losses under IFRS 9.\n\nThe  adoption  of  IFRS  9  did  not  have  any  significant  impact  on  the  Company\xe2\x80\x99 s\naccounting policies on financial liabilities.\n\n2)\n\nImpairment of financial assets\nIFRS 9 replaces the \xe2\x80\x9cincurred loss\xe2\x80\x9d model in IAS 39 with a forward-looking \xe2\x80\x9cexpected\ncredit  loss\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9c ECL\xe2\x80\x9d )  model.

The  extent  and  impact  of\nsignification changes are as follows:\n\n(i)\n\nIFRS 16 Leases\n\nIFRS 16 replaces the existing leases guidance, including IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining\nwhether an Arrangement contains a Lease, SIC-15 Operating Leases \xe2\x80\x93 Incentives and SIC-27\nEvaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease.\n\nIFRS  16  introduces  a  single  and  an  on-balance  sheet  lease  accounting  model  for  lessees.  A\nlessee recognizes a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset and a\nlease  liability  representing  its  obligation  to  make  lease  payments.  In  addition,  the  nature  of\nexpenses related to those leases will now be changed since IFRS 16 replaces the straight-line\noperating lease expense with a depreciation charge for right-of-use assets and interest expense\non lease liabilities. There are recognition exemptions for short-term leases and leases of low-\nvalue items. The lessor accounting remains similar to the current standard \xe2\x80\x93 i.e. the lessors will\ncontinue to classify leases as finance or operating leases.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED\n\nNotes to Parent-Company-Only Financial Statements\n\n15\n\n1)\n\nDetermining whether an arrangement contains a lease\n\n On transition to IFRS 16, the Company can choose to apply either of the following: \n\n\xef\x82\xb7 IFRS 16 definition of lease to all its contracts; or \n\xef\x82\xb7 a  practical  expedient  that  does  not  need  any  reassessment  whether  a  contract  is,  or\n\ncontains, a lease. \n\nThe  Company  plans  to  apply  IFRS  16  definition  of  a  lease  to  all  its  contracts  upon\ntransition.\n\n2)\n\nTransition\n\nAs a lessee, the Company can apply the standard using either of the following: \n\n\xef\x82\xb7 retrospective approach; or \n\xef\x82\xb7 modified retrospective approach with optional practical expedients. \n\nThe Company plans to initially apply IFRS 16 using the modified retrospective approach.\nTherefore, the cumulative effect of adopting IFRS 16 will be recognized as an adjustment\nin the opening balance of retained earnings at January 1, 2019, with no restatement of\ncomparative information. \n\nWhen  applying  the  modified  retrospective  approach  to  leases  previously  classified  as\noperating leases under IAS 17, the lessee can elect, on a lease-by-lease basis, whether to\napply a number of practical expedients on transition. The Company chooses to elect the\nfollowing practical expedients:\n\n\xef\x82\xb7 apply a single discount rate to a portfolio of leases with similar characteristics;\n\xef\x82\xb7 apply  the  exemption,  and  not  to  recognize  the  right-of-use  asset  and  lease  liabilities\n\nwith  lease term that ends within 12 months at the date of initial application;\n\n\xef\x82\xb7 exclude  the  initial  direct  costs  from  measuring  the  right-of-use  asset  at  the  date  of\n\n\xef\x82\xb7 use hindsight to determine the lease term while the contract contains options to extend\n\ninitial application; and\n\nor terminate the lease.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED\n\nNotes to Parent-Company-Only Financial Statements\n\n16\n\n3)\n\nSo far, the most significant impact identified is that the Company will have to recognize\nthe  right-of-use  assets  and  lease  liabilities  for  the  operating  leases  of  its  offices  and\nwarehouses, which will result in an increase of $187,485 in its right-of-use assets and\nlease liabilities on January 1, 2019. Besides, the Company does not expect the adoption\nof  IFRS  16  to  have  any  impact  on  its  ability  to  comply  with  the  maximum  leverage\nthreshold loan covenant. Also, the Company is not required to make any adjustments for\nleases in which the Company is the intermediate lessor in a sub-lease.\n\nThe  actual  impacts  of  adopting  the  amended  standards  and  new  interpretations  may  change\ndepending on the economic conditions and events which may occur in the future.\n\n(c)\n\nImpact of IFRS issued by IASB but not yet endorsed by the FSC\n\nA summary of new and amended standards issued by the IASB but not yet endorsed by the FSC is\nset out below:\n\nNew, Revised or Amended Standards and Interpretations\n\nAmendments to IFRS 3 Definition of a Business\nAmendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 Sale or Contribution of Assets Between an\n\nInvestor and Its Associate or Joint Venture\n\nIFRS 17 Insurance Contracts\nAmendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8 Definition of Material\n\nEffective date\n\nper IASB\n\nJanuary 1, 2020\nEffective date to\nbe determined\nby IASB\nJanuary 1, 2021\nJanuary 1, 2020\n\nThose which may be relevant to the Company are set out below:\nIssuance / Release\n\nStandards or\nInterpretations\n\nDates\n\nOctober 31, 2018\n\nAmendments to IAS 1 and IAS\n8 Definition of Material\n\nContent of amendment\n\nfeatured  elsewhere \n\nThe  amendments  clarify  the  definition  of\nmaterial  and  how  it  should  be  applied  by\nincluding in the definition guidance that until\nnow  has \nIFRS\nStandards.

Exchange  differences  arising  on  the  translation  of  non-monetary  items  are\nrecognized in profit or loss, except for exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-\nmonetary  items  in  respect  of  which  gains  and  losses  are  recognized  directly  in  other\ncomprehensive income, in which case, the exchange differences are also recognized directly in\nother comprehensive income. Non-monetary items denominated in foreign currencies that are\nmeasured at historical cost are not retranslated.\n\n(ii) Foreign operations\n\nThe assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments\narising from acquisition, are translated into the presentation currency of the Company\xe2\x80\x99s parent-\ncompany-only financial statements at the exchange rates at the reporting date. The income and\nexpenses of foreign operations, excluding foreign operations in hyperinflationary economies,\nare translated into the presentation currency of the Company\xe2\x80\x99s parent-company-only financial\nstatements at the average exchange rates for the period. All resulting exchange differences are\nrecognized in other comprehensive income.\n\nOn the disposal of a foreign operation which involves a loss of control over a subsidiary or loss\nof significant influence over an associate that includes a foreign operation, all of the exchange\ndifferences accumulated in equity in respect of that operation attributable to the shareholders\nof the Company are entirely reclassified to profit or loss.  In the case of a partial disposal that\ndoes  not  result  in  the  Company  losing  control  over  a  subsidiary,  the  proportionate  share  of\naccumulated  exchange  differences  is  reclassified  to  non-controlling  interests.  For  a  partial\ndisposal  of  the  Company\xe2\x80\x99 s  ownership  interest  in  an  associate  or  joint  venture,  the\nproportionate share of the accumulated exchange differences in equity is reclassified to profit\nor loss.\n\nWhen the settlement of a monetary receivable from or payable to a foreign operation is neither\nplanned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future, the monetary item is, in substance, a part\nof net investment in that foreign operation, and the related foreign exchange gains and losses\nthereon are recognized as other comprehensive income.\n\n(d) Classification of current and non-current assets and liabilities\n\nAn  asset  is  classified  as  current  when  one  of  the  following  criteria  is  met;  all  other  assets  are\nclassified as non-current assets:\n\nIt is expected to be realized, or intended to be sold or consumed in the normal operating cycle;\nIt is held primarily for the purpose of trading;\nIt is expected to be realized within twelve months after the reporting period; or \n\n(i)\n(ii)\n(iii)\n(iv) The asset is cash or a cash equivalent unless the asset is restricted from being exchanged or\n\nused to settle a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting period.\n\nA liability is classified as current when one of the following criteria is met; all other liabilities are\nclassified as non-current liabilities:\n\n(i)\n(ii)\n(iii)\n\nIt is expected to be settled in the normal operating cycle;\nIt is held primarily for the purpose of trading;\nIt is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting period; or \n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED\n\nNotes to Parent-Company-Only Financial Statements\n\n19\n\n(iv) The Company does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at\nleast twelve months after the reporting period. Terms of a liability that could, at the option of\nthe  counterparty,  result  in  its  settlement  by  issuing  equity  instruments  do  not  affect  its\nclassification.\n\n(e) Cash and cash equivalents\n\nCash consists of cash on hand, checking deposits, and demand deposits.  Cash equivalents consist of\nshort-term and highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and\nare subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.  Time deposits that meet the aforesaid criteria\nand are not held for investing purposes are also classified as cash equivalents.\n\nBank  overdrafts  that  are  repayable  on  demand  and  form  an  integral  part  of  the  Company\xe2\x80\x99 s  cash\nmanagement  are  included  as  a  component  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents  for  the  purpose  of  the\nstatement of cash flows.\n\n(f)\n\nFinancial instruments\n\n(i)\n\nFinancial assets (applicable commencing January 1, 2018)\n\nFinancial assets are classified into the following categories: measured at amortized cost, fair\nvalue through other comprehensive income (\xe2\x80\x9cFVOCI\xe2\x80\x9d), and fair value through profit or loss\n(\xe2\x80\x9cFVTPL\xe2\x80\x9d).

These  assets  are  subsequently  measured  at\namortized cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.

This  election  is  made  on  an  instrument-by-instrument\nbasis.\n\nA  financial  asset  measured  at  FVOCI  is  initially  recognized  at  fair  value,  plus  any\ndirectly  attributable  transaction  costs.  These  assets  are  subsequently  measured  at  fair\nvalue. Foreign exchange gains and losses, interest income calculated using the effective\ninterest method, and impairment losses deriving from debt investments, are recognized in\nprofit  or  loss;  whereas  dividends  deriving  from  equity  investments  are  recognized  in\nprofit or loss, unless the dividend clearly represents a recovery of part of the cost of an\ninvestment. Other changes in the carrying amount of financial assets measured at FVOCI\nare  recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income  and  accumulated  in  other  equity  as\nunrealized  gain  (loss)  from  financial  assets  measured  at  fair  value  through  other\ncomprehensive income. On derecognition, gains and losses accumulated in other equity\nof  debt  investments  are  reclassified  to  profit  or  loss.  However,  gains  and  losses\naccumulated  in  other equity of equity investments are reclassified to retained earnings\ninstead of profit or loss.\n\nDividend  income  derived  from  equity  investments  is  recognized  on  the  date  that  the\nCompany\xe2\x80\x99s right to receive the dividends is established (usually the ex-dividend date).\n\n3)\n\nFinancial assets measured at fair value through profit or loss \n\nAll financial assets not classified as measured at amortized cost or at FVOCI described\nas  above  are  measured  at  FVTPL,  including  derivative  financial  assets  and  non-\nderivative financial assets (e.g., convertible bond). On initial recognition, the Company\nmay  irrevocably  designate  a  financial  asset,  which  meets  the  requirements  to  be\nmeasured  at  amortized  cost  or  at  FVOCI,  as  at  FVTPL  if  doing  so  eliminates  or\nsignificantly reduces an accounting mismatch that would otherwise arise.\n\nFinancial  assets  in  this  category  are  initially  recognized  at  fair  value.  Attributable\ntransaction  costs  are  recognized  in  profit  or  loss  as  incurred.  Subsequent  to  initial\nrecognition, they are measured at fair value, any changes therein, including any dividend\nand interest income, are recognized in profit or loss.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED\n\nNotes to Parent-Company-Only Financial Statements\n\n4)\n\nImpairment of financial assets\n\n21\n\nThe Company recognizes loss allowances for expected credit losses on financial assets\nmeasured  at  amortized  cost  (including  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  notes  and  accounts\nreceivable, other receivables, and other financial assets) and contract assets.\n\nThe  Company  measures  loss  allowances  for  accounts  receivable,  contract  assets  and\nother financial assets at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit loss (\xe2\x80\x9cECL\xe2\x80\x9d), except\nfor the following financial assets which are measured using 12-month ECL:\n\n\xef\x82\xb7 debt securities that are determined to have low credit risk at the reporting date; and\n\xef\x82\xb7 other  debt  securities  and  bank  balances  for  which credit risk (i.e. the risk of default\noccurring  over  the  expected  life  of  the  financial  instrument)  has  not  increased\nsignificantly since initial recognition.\n\nLifetime ECLs are the ECLs that result from all possible default events over the expected\nlife of a financial instrument. 12-month ECLs are the portion of ECLs that result from\ndefault events that are possible within the 12 months after the reporting date (or a shorter\nperiod if the expected life of the instrument is less than 12 months).\n\nThe  maximum  period  considered  when  estimating  ECLs  is  the  maximum  contractual\nperiod over which the Company is exposed to credit risk.\n\nWhen determining whether the credit risk of a financial asset has increased significantly\nsince initial recognition, the Company considers reasonable and supportable information\nthat is relevant and available without undue cost or effort. The information includes both\nquantitative and qualitative information and analysis based on the Company\xe2\x80\x99s historical\nexperience and credit assessment, as well as forward-looking information.\n\nECLs  are  probability-weighted  estimate  of  credit  losses  over  the  expected  life  of\nfinancial assets. Credit losses are measured as the present value of all cash shortfalls (i.e.,\nthe  difference  between  the  cash  flows  due  to  the  Company  in  accordance  with  the\ncontract and the cash flows that the Company expects to receive). ECLs are discounted at\nthe effective interest rate of the financial asset.\n\nLoss allowances for financial assets measured at amortized cost are deducted from the\ngross carrying amount of the assets. The recognition or reversal of the loss allowance is\nrecognized in profit or loss.\n\nThe gross carrying amount of a financial asset is written off, either partially or in full, to\nthe extent that there is no realistic prospect of recovery. This is generally the case when\nthe Company determines that the debtor does not have assets or sources of income that\ncould  generate  sufficient  cash  flows  to  repay  the  amounts  subject  to  the  write-off.\nHowever,  financial  assets  that  are  written  off  could  still  be  subject  to  enforcement\nactivities  in  order  to  comply  with  the  Company\xe2\x80\x99s procedures for recovery of amounts\ndue.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0c22\n\nACER INCORPORATED\n\nNotes to Parent-Company-Only Financial Statements\n\n5)\n\nDerecognition of financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are derecognized when the contractual rights of the cash inflow from the\nassets  are  terminated,  or  when  the  Company  transfers  substantially  all  the  risks  and\nrewards of ownership of the financial assets to other enterprises.\n\nOn derecognition of a debt instrument in its entirety, the difference between the carrying\namount and the sum of the consideration received or receivable and any cumulative gain\nor  loss  that  had  been  recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income  and  accumulated  in\n\xe2\x80\x9cother equity\xe2\x80\x93unrealized gain (loss) from financial assets measured at fair value through\nother  comprehensive  income\xe2\x80\x9d   is  recognized  in  profit  or  loss,  and  included  in  non-\noperating income and loss.\n\nOn derecognition of a debt instrument other than in its entirety, the Company allocates\nthe  previous  carrying  amount  of  the  debt  instrument  between  the  part  it  continues  to\nrecognize under continuing involvement, and the part it no longer recognizes on the basis\nof  the  relative  fair  values  of  those  parts  on  the  date  of  the  transfer.  The  difference\nbetween the carrying amount allocated to the part that is no longer recognized and the\nsum of the consideration received or receivable for the part no longer recognized and any\ncumulative gain or loss allocated to it that had been recognized in other comprehensive\nincome is recognized in profit or loss, and included in non-operating income and loss. A\ncumulative  gain  or  loss  that  had  been  recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income  is\nallocated between the part that continues to be recognized and the part that is no longer\nrecognized on the basis of the relative fair values of those parts.\n\n(ii) Financial assets (applicable before January 1, 2018)\n\nFinancial  assets  are  classified  into  the  following  categories:  financial  assets  at  fair  value\nthrough profit or loss, loans and receivables, and available-for-sale financial assets. A regular\nway purchase or sale of financial assets is recognized or derecognized on a trade-date basis. \n\n1)\n\nFinancial assets at fair value through profit or loss \n\nFinancial  assets  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss consist of financial assets held for\ntrading  and  those  designated  as  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  at  inception.  A\nfinancial  asset  is  classified  in  this  category  if  acquired  principally  for  the  purpose  of\nselling in the short term. Derivatives are also categorized as financial assets at fair value\nthrough  profit  or  loss  unless  they  are  designated  as  hedges.  The  Company  designates\nfinancial assets, other than ones classified as held for trading, as at fair value through\nprofit or loss at initial recognition under one of the following situations:\n\xe2\x80\xa7 Such  designation  eliminates  or  significantly  reduces  a  measurement  or  recognition\ninconsistency  that  would  otherwise  arise  from  measuring  assets  or  liabilities  or\nrecognizing the gains and losses on them on a different basis;\n\xe2\x80\xa7Performance of the financial asset is evaluated on a fair value basis;\n\xe2\x80\xa7A hybrid instrument contains one or more embedded derivatives.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED\n\nNotes to Parent-Company-Only Financial Statements\n\n23\n\nAt  initial  recognition,  financial  assets  carried  at  fair  value  through  profit  or  loss  are\nrecognized at fair value. Any attributable transaction costs are recognized in profit or loss\nas  incurred.  Subsequent  to  the  initial  recognition,  changes  in  fair  value  (including\ndividend  income  and  interest  income)  are  recognized  in  profit  or  loss  and  included  in\nnon-operating income and loss. \n\n2)\n\nLoans and receivables\n\nLoans  and  receivables  are  non-derivative  financial  assets  with  fixed  or  determinable\npayments  that  are  not  quoted  in  an  active  market.  Loans  and  receivables  comprise\naccounts  receivable,  other  receivables  and  investments  in  debt  instrument  without  an\nactive  market.  At  initial  recognition,  such  assets  are  recognized  at  fair  value  plus  any\ndirectly  attributable  transaction  costs.  Subsequent  to  initial  recognition,  loans  and\nreceivables  other  than  insignificant  interest  on  short-term  receivables  are  measured  at\namortized  cost  using  the  effective  interest  method  less  any  impairment losses. Interest\nincome is recognized as non-operating income in profit or loss.\n\n3)\n\nAvailable-for sale financial assets\n\nAvailable-for-sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are designated\nas available for sale or are not classified in any of the other categories of financial assets.\nAt initial recognition, available-for-sale financial assets are recognized at fair value plus\nany directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, these assets\nare  measured  at  fair  value,  and  changes therein, other than impairment losses, interest\nincome  calculated  using  the  effective  interest  method,  dividend  income,  and  foreign\ncurrency differences on monetary financial assets, are recognized in other comprehensive\nincome and accumulated in other equity as unrealized gain (loss) from available-for-sale\nfinancial  assets.  When  the  financial  asset  is  derecognized,  the  gain  or  loss  previously\naccumulated in equity is reclassified to profit or loss. \n\nDividends received from equity investments are recognized as non-operating income on\nthe date of entitlement to receive the dividends (usually the ex-dividend date).\n\n4)\n\nImpairment of financial assets\n\nFinancial assets, other than those carried at fair value through profit or loss, are assessed\nfor indicators of impairment at the end of each reporting period. Those financial assets\nare considered to be impaired when there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or\nmore  events  that  occurred  after  the  initial  recognition  of  the  financial  assets,  their\nestimated future cash flows have been affected. \n\nEvidence  of  impairment  may  include  indications  that  the  debtor  is  experiencing\nsignificant financial difficulty, default or delinquency in interest or principal payments,\nindications  that  the  debtor  or  issuer  will  probably  enter  bankruptcy  or  other  financial\nreorganization, and the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because\nof  financial  difficulties.  For  available-for-sale  equity  investments,  a  significant  or\nprolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is also evidence that the\nassets are impaired. \n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED\n\nNotes to Parent-Company-Only Financial Statements\n\n24\n\nIf  the  Company  determines  that  no  objective  evidence  of  impairment  exists  for  an\nindividually  assessed  account  receivable,  whether  significant  or  not,  such  account\nreceivable  is  included  in  a  group  of  accounts  receivable  with  similar  credit  risk\ncharacteristics which are then collectively assessed for impairment.  Objective evidence\nthat receivables are impaired includes the Company\xe2\x80\x99s collection experience in the past,\nan increase of delayed payments, and national or local economic conditions that correlate\nwith arrears of receivables.\n\nAn  impairment  loss  is  recognized  by  reducing  the  carrying  amount  of  the  respective\nfinancial assets with the exception of receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced\nthrough  an  allowance  account.  Except  for  the  write-off  of  uncollectible  receivables\nagainst  the  allowance  account,  changes  in  the  amount  of  the  allowance  account  are\nrecognized in profit or loss.\n\nAn impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortized cost is measured\nas the excess of the asset\xe2\x80\x99s carrying amount over the present value of the estimated future\ncash  flows  discounted  at  the  financial  asset\xe2\x80\x99 s  original  effective  interest  rate.  If,  in  a\nsubsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be\nrelated  objectively  to  an  event  occurring  after  the  impairment  was  recognized,  the\npreviously recognized impairment loss is reversed to the extent that the carrying amount\nof the financial assets at the date the impairment loss is reversed does not exceed what\nthe amortized cost would have been had the impairment loss not been recognized.\n\nWhen  an  impairment  loss  is  recognized  for  an  available-for-sale  asset,  the  cumulative\ngains  or  loss  that  had  been  recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income  is  reclassified\nfrom equity to profit or loss. Any subsequent recovery in the fair value of an impaired\navailable-for-sale  equity  security  is  recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income,  and\naccumulated  in  other  equity.  If,  in  a  subsequent  period,  the  fair  value  of  an  impaired\navailable-for-sale debt security increases and the increase can be related objectively to an\nevent  occurring  after  the  impairment  loss  was  recognized,  then  the  impairment  loss  is\nreversed, with the amount of the reversal recognized in profit or loss. \n\nImpairment  losses  and  recoveries  of  accounts  receivable  are  recognized  as  operating\nexpenses.  Impairment  losses  and  recoveries  of  other  financial assets are recognized as\nother gains and losses under non-operating income and loss.\n\n5)\n\nDerecognition of financial assets\n\nFinancial assets are derecognized when the contractual rights of the cash inflow from the\nasset are terminated, or when the Company transfers out substantially all the risks and\nrewards of ownership of the financial assets to other enterprises.\n\nOn derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the carrying\namount and the sum of the consideration received or receivable and any cumulative gain\nor  loss  that  had  been  recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income  and  accumulated  in\n\xe2\x80\x9c other  equity  \xe2\x80\x93   unrealized  gain  (loss)  from  available-for-sale  financial  assets\xe2\x80\x9d   is\nrecognized in profit or loss, and included in non-operating income and loss.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0c25\n\nACER INCORPORATED\n\nNotes to Parent-Company-Only Financial Statements\n\nOn  derecognition  of  part  of  a  financial  asset,  the  previous  carrying  amount  of  the\nfinancial asset shall be allocated between the part that continues to be recognized and the\npart that is derecognized, on the basis of relative fair values of those parts on the date of\ntransfer. The difference between the carrying amount allocated to the part derecognized\nand the sum of the consideration received or receivable for the part of the financial asset\nderecognized  and  the  cumulative  gain  or  loss  that  has  been  recognized  in  other\ncomprehensive income allocated to the part derecognized is charged to profit or loss and\nincluded  in  non-operating  income  and  loss.  A  cumulative  gain  or  loss  that  had  been\nrecognized in other comprehensive income is allocated between the part that continues to\nbe recognized and the part that is derecognized, based on the relative fair values of those\nparts.\n\n(iii) Financial liabilities and equity instruments\n\n1)\n\nClassification of debt or equity\n\nDebt or equity instruments issued by the Company are classified as financial liabilities or\nequity  in  accordance  with  the  substance  of  the  contractual  agreement.  An  equity\ninstrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company\nafter deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments are recognized at the amount of\nconsideration received less the direct issuing cost.\n\nInterest and gain or loss related to the financial liability are recognized in profit or loss\nand included in non-operating income and loss.\n\n2)\n\nFinancial liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss\n\nA financial liability is classified in this category if it is classified as held for trading or is\ndesignated as a financial liability measured at fair value through profit or loss on initial\nrecognition.  A  financial  liability  is  classified  as  held  for  trading  if  it  is  acquired\nprincipally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the short term.  Derivatives are\nalso categorized as financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss unless they are\ndesignated  as  hedges.    The  Company  designates  financial  liabilities,  other  than  those\nclassified as held for trading, as measured at fair value through profit or loss at initial\nrecognition under one of the following situations:\n\xe2\x80\xa7 Such  designation  eliminates  or  significantly  reduces  a  measurement  or  recognition\ninconsistency  that  would  otherwise  arise  from  measuring  assets  or  liabilities  or\nrecognizing the gains and losses on them on a different basis;\n\xe2\x80\xa7Performance of the financial liabilities is evaluated on a fair value basis; \n\xe2\x80\xa7A hybrid instrument contains one or more embedded derivatives.\nAt  initial  recognition,  the  financial  liability  is  recognized  at  fair  value,  and  any\nattributable  transaction  costs  are  recognized  in  profit  or  loss  as  incurred.  Subsequent\nchanges that are measured at fair value, which take into account any interest expense, are\nrecognized in profit or loss and included in non-operating income and loss.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED\n\nNotes to Parent-Company-Only Financial Statements\n\n26\n\n3)\n\nFinancial liabilities measured at amortized cost\n\nFinancial liabilities not classified as held for trading or not designated as at fair value\nthrough profit or loss, which comprise loans and borrowings, accounts payable, and other\npayables,  are  measured  at  fair  value  plus  any  directly  attributable  transaction  costs  at\ninitial  recognition.  Subsequent  to  initial  recognition,  these  financial  liabilities  are\nmeasured at amortized cost using the effective interest method. \n\n4)\n\nDerecognition of financial liabilities\n\nThe Company derecognizes a financial liability when its contractual obligation has been\nfulfilled or cancelled, or has expired. The difference between the carrying amount of a\nfinancial liability derecognized and the consideration paid (including any non-cash assets\ntransferred  or  liabilities  assumed)  is  recognized  in  profit  or  loss  and  included  in  non-\noperating income and loss.\n\n5)\n\nOffsetting of financial assets and liabilities \n\nFinancial assets and liabilities are presented on a net basis only when the Company has\nthe  legally  enforceable  right  to  offset  and  intends  to  settle  such  financial  assets  and\nliabilities on a net basis or to realize the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.\n\n(iv) Derivative  financial  instruments  and  hedge  accounting  (applicable  commencing  January  1,\n\n2018) \n\nThe Company uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency and interest\nrate  exposures.  Derivatives  are  initially  measured  at  fair  value.  Any  attributable  transaction\ncosts  thereof  are  recognized  in  profit  or  loss  as  incurred.  Subsequent  to  initial  recognition,\nderivatives are measured at fair value, and changes therein are recognized in profit or loss and\nincluded  in  non-operating  income  and  loss,  unless  the  derivative  financial  instruments  are\ndesignated as effective hedging instruments, in which the timing of the recognition in profit or\nloss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship. If the valuation of a derivative instrument\nresults in a positive fair value, it is classified as a financial asset; otherwise, it is classified as a\nfinancial liability.\n\nEmbedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for separately if the\neconomic  characteristics  and  risks  of  the  host  contract  that  is  a  non-financial  asset  are  not\nclosely related to the embedded derivatives and the host contract is not measured at FVTPL.\n\nCertain derivatives are designated as either (i) hedges of the fair value of recognized assets or\nliabilities (fair value hedge) or (ii) hedges of highly probable forecast transactions (cash flow\nhedge).  The Group documents, at the inception of the transaction, the relationship between\nhedging instruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy\nfor  undertaking  various  hedging  transactions.  The  Group  also  documents  its  assessment  of\nwhether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes\nin fair value or cash flows of hedged items.\n\nThe  Company  shall  discontinue  hedge  accounting  prospectively  only  when  the  hedging\nrelationship (or a part of a hedging relationship) ceases to meet the qualifying criteria (after\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED\n\nNotes to Parent-Company-Only Financial Statements\n\n27\n\ntaking into account any rebalancing of the hedging relationship, if applicable). This includes\ninstances when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised.\n\n1)\n\nFair value hedge\n\nChanges in the fair value of a hedging instrument that is qualified as a fair value hedge\nare  recognized  in  profit  or  loss  (or  other  comprehensive  income,  if  the  hedging\ninstrument hedges an equity instrument measured at FVOCI). \n\n2)\n\nCash flow hedge\n\nWhen  a  derivative  is  designated  and  qualified  as  a  cash  flow  hedging  instrument,  the\neffective  portion  of  changes  in  the  fair  value  is  recognized  in  other  comprehensive\nincome and accumulated in \xe2\x80\x9cother equity \xe2\x80\x94 gains (losses) on hedging instruments\xe2\x80\x9d, and\nis limited to the cumulative change in fair value of the hedged item from inception of the\nhedge. Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognized\nimmediately in profit or loss, and included in non-operating income and loss.\n\nAmounts  previously  recognized  in  other  comprehensive  income  and  accumulated  in\nequity  are  reclassified  to  profit  or  loss  in  the  same  periods  when  the  hedged  item  is\nrecognized in profit or loss, and are included in the same account in the statements of\ncomprehensive income as the hedged item.\n\n(v) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting (applicable before January 1, 2018) \n\nExcept  for  the  following  items,  the  Company  applied  the  same  accounting  policies  as\napplicable commencing January 1, 2018.\n\nEmbedded derivatives are separated from the host contract and accounted for separately if the\neconomic characteristics and risk of the host contract are not closely related to the embedded\nderivatives and the host contract is not measured at FVTPL.\n\nFor all cash flow hedges including hedges of expected transactions recognized in non-financial\nassets  or  non-financial  liabilities,  amounts  previously  recognized  in  other  comprehensive\nincome, and accumulated in equity, are reclassified to profit or loss in the same periods when\nexpected cash flow of hedged items are recognized in profit or loss. In addition, for the cash\nflow  hedge  that  is  discontinuing  before  January  1,  2018,  changes  in  fair  value  of  forward\nposition are recognized in profit or loss.\n\n(g)\n\nInventories\n\nInventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realizable value. Inventories are recorded at\nstandard cost and adjusted to approximate weighted-average cost at the end of the reporting period.\nNet realizable value represents the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less all\nestimated costs of completion and necessary selling expenses.\n\n(h)\n\nInvestments in associates and interests in joint venture\n\nAn  associate  is  an  entity  over  which  the  Company  has  significant  influence  and  that  is  neither  a\nsubsidiary nor a joint venture. Significant influence is the power to participate in the financial and\noperating policy decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED\n\nNotes to Parent-Company-Only Financial Statements\n\n28\n\nA joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the Company and other parties that have joint control\nof  the  arrangement  have  rights  to  the  net  assets  of  the  joint  arrangement.  Joint  control  is  the\ncontractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about\nthe relevant activities require unanimous consent of the parties sharing control. \n\nThe operating results as well as assets and liabilities of associates and joint venture are incorporated\nin these financial statements using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, an\ninvestment in an associate or a joint venture is initially recognized in the balance sheet at cost, and\nadjusted  thereafter,  to  recognize  the  Company\xe2\x80\x99 s  share  of  profit  or  loss  and  other  comprehensive\nincome (loss) of the associate and joint venture, as well as the distribution received. The Company\nalso recognizes its share in the changes in the equities of associates and joint venture.\n\nAny  excess  of  the  cost  of  acquisition  over  the  Company\xe2\x80\x99 s  share  of  the  net  fair  value  of  the\nidentifiable  assets  and  liabilities  of  an  associate  or  a  joint  venture  recognized  at  the  date  of\nacquisition,  is  recognized  as  goodwill,  which  is  included  within  the  carrying  amount  of  the\ninvestment. Any excess of the Company\xe2\x80\x99s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets and\nliabilities over the cost of acquisition, after reassessment, is recognized immediately in profit or loss.\n\nWhen  necessary,  the  entire  carrying  amount  of  the  investment  (including  goodwill)  is  tested  for\nimpairment as a single asset by comparing its recoverable amount (higher of value in use and fair\nvalue, less, costs to sell) with its carrying amount. Any impairment loss recognized forms part of the\ncarrying amount of the investment. Any reversal of that impairment loss is recognized to the extent\nthat the recoverable amount of the investment subsequently increases.\n\nThe  Company  discontinues  the  use  of  equity  method  from the date when the Company ceases to\nhave significant influence over an associate. When the Company retains an interest in the former\nassociate,  the  Company  measures  the  retained  interest  at  fair  value  at  that  date.  The  difference\nbetween the carrying amount of the associate at the date the equity method was discontinued, and the\nfair value of any retained interest and any proceeds from disposing of a part interest in the associate,\nis  included  in  the  determination  of  the  gain  or  loss  on  disposal  of  the  associate.  In  addition,  the\nCompany shall account for all amounts recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to that\nassociate on the same basis as would be required if the associate had directly disposed of the related\nassets or liabilities. If the Company\xe2\x80\x99s ownership interest in an associate is reduced as a result of\ndisposal,  with  the  investment  continues  to  be  an associate, the Company should reclassify only a\nproportionate amount of the gain or loss previously recognized in other comprehensive income to\nprofit or loss.\n\nWhen the Company subscribes to additional shares in an associate or a joint venture at a percentage\ndifferent  from  its  existing  ownership  percentage,  the  resulting  carrying  amount  of  the  investment\ndiffers from the amount of the Company\xe2\x80\x99s proportionate interest in the net assets of the associate or\njoint  venture.  The  Company  records  such  a  difference  as  an  adjustment  to  investments  with  the\ncorresponding amount charged or credited to capital surplus. If the Company\xe2\x80\x99s ownership interest is\nreduced  due  to  the  additional  subscription  to  the  shares  of  associate  or  joint  venture  by  other\ninvestors,  the  proportionate  amount  of  the  gains  or  losses  previously  recognized  in  other\ncomprehensive income in relation to that associate or joint venture shall be reclassified to profit or\nloss on the same basis as would be required if the associate or joint venture had directly disposed of\nthe related assets or liabilities.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED\n\nNotes to Parent-Company-Only Financial Statements\n\n29\n\nUnrealized  profits  resulting  from  transactions  between  the  Company  and  an  associate  or  joint\nventure  are  eliminated  to  the  extent  of  the  Company\xe2\x80\x99 s  interest  in  the  associate  or  joint  venture.\nUnrealized losses on transactions with associates or joint venture are eliminated in the same way,\nexcept to the extent that the underlying asset is impaired.\n\nAdjustments  are  made  to  associates\xe2\x80\x99   and  joint  ventures\xe2\x80\x99   financial  statements  to  conform  to  the\naccounting polices applied by the Company. \n\n(i)\n\nInvestments in subsidiaries\n\nWhen preparing the parent-company-only financial statements, investment in subsidiaries which are\ncontrolled  by  the  Company  is  accounted  for  using  the  equity  method.  Carrying  amount  of\ninvestments in subsidiaries includes goodwill arising from initial recognition less any accumulated\nimpairment losses, which is recognized as a reduction of carry amount. Under equity method, profit\nor loss and other comprehensive income recognized in parent-company-only financial statement is\nthe  same  as  total  comprehensive  income  attributable  to  shareholders  of  the  Company  in  the\nconsolidated financial statements. In addition, changes in equity recognized in parent-company-only\nfinancial  statement  is  the  same  as  changes  in  equity  attributable  to  owners  of  parent  in  the\nconsolidated financial statements. Changes in a parent\xe2\x80\x99s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do\nnot result in the loss of control are accounted for within equity.\n\nThe Company uses acquisition method for acquisitions of new subsidiaries. Goodwill is measured at\nthe  excess  of  the  acquisition-date  fair  value  of  consideration  transferred  (including  any  non-\ncontrolling interest in the acquiree) over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable\nassets acquired and liabilities assumed (generally at fair value). If the residual balance is negative,\nthe  Company  shall  re-assess  whether  it  has  correctly  identified  all  of  the  assets  acquired  and\nliabilities assumed and recognize any additional assets or liabilities that are identified in that review,\nand shall recognize a gain on the bargain purchase thereafter. For each acquisition, non-controlling\ninterest  in  the  acquiree  is  measured  either  at  fair  value  or  at  the  non-controlling  interest\xe2\x80\x99 s\nproportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree\xe2\x80\x99s identifiable net assets.\n\nIn an acquisition of new subsidiary achieved in batches, the previously held equity interest in the\nacquiree  at  its  acquisition  date  fair  value  is  remeasured,  and  the  resulting  gain  or  loss,  if  any,  is\nrecognized in profit or loss. For all amounts recognized in other comprehensive income arising from\nchange in equity of acquiree prior to acquisition date, the Company shall treat it on the same basis as\nif  the  Company  directly  dispose  of  the  previously  held  equity  interest.  If  the  amounts  previously\nrecognized in other comprehensive income shall be reclassified to profit or loss as would be required\nwhile disposal of such interest, the Company shall reclassify it to profit or loss.\n\nIf the initial accounting for an acquisition is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which\nthe  acquisition  occurs,  provisional  amounts  for  the  items  which  the  accounting  is  incomplete  are\nreported  in  the  financial  statements.  During  the  measurement  period,  the  provisional  amounts\nrecognized at the acquisition date are retrospectively adjusted to reflect new information obtained\nabout facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date. The measurement period shall\nnot exceed one year from the acquisition date.\n\nAcquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred except for the costs related to issuance of debt or\nequity instruments.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED\n\nNotes to Parent-Company-Only Financial Statements\n\n30\n\n(j)\n\nProperty, plant and equipment \n\n(i)\n\nRecognition and measurement\n\nProperty,  plant  and  equipment  are  measured  at  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation  and\naccumulated  impairment  losses.  Cost  includes  expenditure  that  is  directly  attributed  to  the\nacquisition of the asset and bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for it to\nbe capable of operating in the manner intended by management, the initial estimate of the costs\nof dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which it is located, and any\nborrowing  cost  that  is  eligible  for  capitalization.  Purchased  software  that  is  integral  to  the\nfunctionality of the related equipment is capitalized as part of that equipment.\n\nThe  gain  or  loss  arising  from  the  disposal  of  an  item  of  property,  plant  and  equipment  is\ndetermined  as  the  difference  between  the  net  disposal  proceeds,  if  any,  and  the  carrying\namount of the item, and is recognized as non-operating income and loss.\n\n(ii) Reclassification to investment property \n\nA property is reclassified to investment property at its carrying amount when the purpose of\nthe property changes from owner-occupied to investment.  \n\n(iii) Subsequent costs\n\nSubsequent  costs  are  capitalized  only  when  it  is  probable  that  future  economic  benefits\nassociated with the costs will flow to the Company and the cost of the item can be measured\nreliably. The carrying amount of the replaced part is derecognized in profit and loss. All other\nrepairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred.\n\n(iv) Depreciation\n\nDepreciation is calculated on the cost of assets less their residual values and is recognized on a\nstraight  line  basis  over  the  estimated  useful  lives.  When  an  item  of  property,  plant  and\nequipment  comprises  significant  individual  components  for  which  different  depreciation\nmethods or useful lives are appropriate, each component is depreciated separately. Land is not\ndepreciated. The depreciation is recognized in profit or loss.\n\nThe estimated useful lives of property, plant and equipment for the current and comparative\nperiods are as follows: buildings\xef\xbc\x8dmain structure - 30 to 50 years; air-conditioning system - 10\nyears;  other  equipment  pertaining  to  buildings  -  20  years;  computer  and  communication\nequipment - 3 to 5 years; and other equipment - 3 to 10 years.\n\nDepreciation  methods,  useful  lives,  and  residual  values  are reviewed at each financial year-\nend, with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED\n\nNotes to Parent-Company-Only Financial Statements\n\n31\n\n(k)\n\nInvestment property\n\nInvestment property is property held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or for\nboth, but not for sale in the ordinary course of business or for administrative purposes. Investment\nproperty  is  measured  at  cost  on  initial  recognition.    Subsequent  to  initial  recognition,  investment\nproperty  is  measured  at  initial  acquisition  cost  less  accumulated  depreciation  and  accumulated\nimpairment losses.  The methods for depreciating and determining the useful life and residual value\nof investment property are the same as those adopted for property, plant and equipment. \n\nCost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the investment property,\nbringing the investment property to the condition necessary for intend use, and any borrowing cost\nthat is eligible for capitalization.\n\nAn investment property is reclassified to property, plant and equipment at its carrying amount when\nthe purpose of the investment property has been changed from investment to owner-occupied.\n\n(l)\n\nLeases\n\nLeases  are  classified  as  finance  leases when the Company assumes substantially all the risks and\nrewards incidental to ownership of the assets. All other leases are classified as operating leases.\n\n(i)\n\nThe Company as lessor\n\nLease income from an operating lease is recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis\nover the lease term. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease\nare added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognized as expense over the lease\nterm on a straight-line basis. Incentives granted to the lessee to enter into the operating lease\nare  recognized  as  a  reduction  of  rental  income  over  the  lease  term  on  a  straight-line  basis.\nContingent  rents  are  recognized  as  income  in  the  period  when  the  lease  adjustments  are\nconfirmed.\n\n(ii) The Company as lessee \n\nPayments  made  under  operating  leases  (excluding  insurance  and  maintenance  expenses)  are\ncharged to expense over the lease term on a straight-line basis. Lease incentives received from\nthe lessor are recognized as a reduction of rental expense over the lease term on a straight-line\nbasis. Contingent rents are recognized as expense in the period when the lease adjustments are\nconfirmed.\n\n(m)\n\nIntangible assets\n\n(i) Goodwill\n\nGoodwill  arising  from  the  Company  acquiring  subsidiaries  is  included  in  intangible  assets.\nRefer  to  note  4(i)  for  the  description  of  the  measurement  of  goodwill  at  initial  recognition.\nGoodwill arising from acquisitions of subsidiaries and associates are included in the carrying\namount of investments in associates. Goodwill is not amortized but is measured at cost less\naccumulated impairment losses.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED\n\nNotes to Parent-Company-Only Financial Statements\n\n32\n\n(ii) Trademarks\n\nTrademarks  are  measured  at  cost.  Subsequent  to  the  initial  recognition,  trademarks  with\ndefinite  useful  lives  are  carried  at  cost  less  accumulated  amortization  and  accumulated\nimpairment  losses.  Trademarks  with  indefinite  useful  lives  are  carried  at  cost  less  any\naccumulated impairment losses and are tested for impairment annually. The useful life of an\nintangible asset not subject to amortization is reviewed annually at each financial year-end to\ndetermine  whether  events  and  circumstances  continue  to  support  an  indefinite  useful  life\nassessment for the asset. Any change in the useful life assessment from indefinite to definite is\naccounted for as a change in accounting estimate.\n\n(iii) Other intangible assets\n\nOther separately acquired intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization\nand accumulated impairment losses. Amortization is recognized in profit or loss on a straight-\nline basis over the following estimated useful lives: patents - 4 to 15 years; acquired software -\n1 to 3 years.\n\nThe residual value, amortization period, and amortization method are reviewed at least at each\nfinancial year-end. Any changes shall be accounted for as changes in accounting estimates.\n\n(n)\n\nImpairment of non-financial assets\n\n(i) Goodwill \n\nFor the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill arising from an acquisition of subsidiary is\nallocated to each of the Company\xe2\x80\x99s cash-generating units (CGUs) that are expected to benefit\nfrom the synergies of the combination.  The CGUs with goodwill are tested annually (or when\nthere  are  indications  that  a  CGU  may  have  been  impaired)  for  impairment.  When  the\nrecoverable amount of a CGU is less than the carrying amount of the CGU, the impairment\nloss  is  recognized  firstly  by  reducing  the  carrying  amount  of  any  goodwill  allocated  to  the\nCGU  and  then  proportionately  allocated  to  the  other  assets  of  the  CGU  on  the  basis  of  the\ncarrying amount of each asset in the CGU.  Any impairment loss is recognized immediately in\nprofit or loss. A subsequent reversal of the impairment loss on goodwill is prohibited.\n\n(ii) Other tangible and intangible assets \n\nNon-financial assets other than inventories, deferred income tax assets, and assets arising from\nemployee  benefits  are  reviewed  for impairment at each reporting date to determine whether\nthere is any indication of impairment. When there exists an indication of impairment for an\nasset,  the  recoverable  amount  of  the  asset  is  estimated.  If  the  recoverable  amount  of  an\nindividual asset cannot be determined, the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the\nCGU to which the asset has been allocated. \n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED\n\nNotes to Parent-Company-Only Financial Statements\n\n33\n\nThe recoverable amount for an individual asset or a CGU is the higher of its fair value less\ncosts to sell or its value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are\ndiscounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the evaluation of\ncurrent market on the time values of money and on the risks specific to the asset. When the\nrecoverable amount of an asset or a CGU is less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount\nof the asset or CGU is reduced to its recoverable amount, and an impairment loss is recognized\nin profit or loss immediately. \n\nThe Company assesses at each reporting date whether there is any evidence that an impairment\nloss recognized in prior periods for an asset other than goodwill may no longer exist or may\nhave decreased.  If so, an impairment loss recognized in prior periods for an asset other than\ngoodwill is reversed, and the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is increased to its revised\nestimate of recoverable amount. The increased carrying amount shall not exceed the carrying\namount  (net  of  amortization  or  depreciation)  that  would  have  been  determined  had  no\nimpairment loss been recognized in prior years.\n\nIntangible  assets  with  indefinite  useful  lives  or  those  not  yet  available  for  use  are  tested\nannually  for  impairment.  An  impairment  loss  is  recognized  for  the  excess  of  the  asset\xe2\x80\x99 s\ncarrying amount over its recoverable amount.\n\n(o)\n\nProvisions\n\nProvisions are recognized when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a\nresult of a past event, it is probable that the Company will be required to settle the obligation, and a\nreliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.  \n\n(i) Warranties\n\nA provision for warranties is recognized when the underlying products or services are sold.\nThis  provision  reflects  the  historical  warranty  claim  rate  and  the  weighting  of  all  possible\noutcomes against their associated probabilities.\n\n(ii) Others\n\nProvisions  for  litigation  claims  and  environmental  restoration  are  recognized  when  the\nCompany  has  a  present  obligation  (legal  or  constructive)  as  a  result  of  a  past  event,  it  is\nprobable that the Company will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can\nbe made of the amount of the obligation.\n\n(p) Treasury stock\n\nCommon stock repurchased by the Company treated as treasury stock (a contra-equity account) is\nreported at acquisition cost (including all directly accountable costs).  When treasury stock is sold,\nthe excess of sales proceeds over cost is accounted for as capital surplus\xef\xbc\x8dtreasury stock.  If the\nsales  proceeds  are  less  than  cost,  the  deficiency  is  accounted  for  as a reduction of the remaining\nbalance  of  capital  surplus\xef\xbc\x8d treasury  stock.  If  the  remaining  balance  of  capital  surplus\xef\xbc\x8d treasury\nstock  is  insufficient  to  cover  the  deficiency,  the  remainder  is  recorded  as  a  reduction  of  retained\nearnings.  The cost of treasury stock is computed using the weighted-average cost of different types\nof repurchase.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED\n\nNotes to Parent-Company-Only Financial Statements\n\n34\n\nIf  treasury  stock  is  retired,  the  weighted-average  cost  of  the  retired  treasury  stock  is  written  off\nagainst the par value and the capital surplus premium, if any, of the stock retired on a pro rata basis.\nIf the weighted-average cost written off exceeds the sum of the par value and the capital surplus, the\ndifference  is  accounted  for  as  a  reduction  of  capital  surplus\xef\xbc\x8d treasury  stock,  or  a  reduction  of\nretained earnings for any deficiency where capital surplus\xef\xbc\x8dtreasury stock is insufficient to cover the\ndifference.  If the weighted-average cost written off is less than the sum of the par value and capital\nsurplus, if any, of the stock retired, the difference is accounted for as an increase in capital surplus\xef\xbc\x8d\ntreasury stock.\n\n(q) Revenue recognition \n\n(i)\n\nRevenue from contracts with customers (policy applicable commencing January 1, 2018)\n\nRevenue is measured based on the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled\nin exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. The Company recognizes revenue\nwhen it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a good or a service to a\ncustomer.  The  accounting  policies  for  the  Company\xe2\x80\x99 s  main  types  of  revenue  are  explained\nbelow.\n\n1)\n\nSale of goods\n\nThe  Company  recognizes  revenue  when  control  of  the  products  has  been  transferred,\nbeing when the products are delivered to the customer, the customer has full discretion\nover the channel and price to sell the products, and there is no unfulfilled obligation that\ncould  affect  the  customer\xe2\x80\x99 s  acceptance  of  the  products.  Delivery  occurs  when  the\nproducts have been shipped to the specific location, the risks of obsolescence and loss\nhave been transferred to the customer, and either the customer has accepted the products\nin  accordance  with  the  sales  contract,  the  acceptance  provisions  have  lapsed,  or  the\nCompany has objective evidence that all criteria for acceptance have been satisfied.\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue based on the price specified in the contract, net of the\nestimated volume discounts and rebates. Accumulated experience is used to estimate the\ndiscounts and rebates using the expected value method, and revenue is only recognized to\nthe extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal will not occur. A refund\nliability  is  recognized  for  expected  sales  discounts  and rebate payable to customers in\nrelation to sales made until the end of the reporting period. No element of financing is\ndeemed present as the sales are made with a credit term from 30 to 90 days, which is\nconsistent with the market practice.\n\nThe  Company\xe2\x80\x99 s  obligation  to  provide  a  refund  for  faulty  goods  under  the  standard\nwarranty terms is recognized as a provision for warranty. Please refer to note 6(o) for\nmore explanation.\n\nA receivable is recognized when the goods are delivered as this is the point in time that\nthe Company has a right to an amount of consideration that is unconditional.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED\n\nNotes to Parent-Company-Only Financial Statements\n\n35\n\n2)\n\nRevenue from service rendered\n\nThe  Company  provides  system  implementation  or  integration  services  to  enterprise\ncustomers. Revenue from providing services is recognized in the accounting periods in\nwhich the services are rendered. For performance obligations that are satisfied over time,\nrevenue is recognized based on the actual service provided to the end of the reporting\nperiod  as  a  proportion  of the total services to be provided. The proportion of services\nprovided is determined based on the portion of the work performed, the time passed by,\nor the milestone reached.\n\nEstimates  of  revenues,  costs,  or  extent  of  progress  toward  completion,  are  revised  if\ncircumstances  change.  Any  resulting  increases  or  decreases  in  estimated  revenues  or\ncosts are reflected in profit or loss in the period in which the circumstances that give rise\nto the revision become known by the management.\n\nIn case of fixed-price contracts, the customer pays the fixed amount based on a payment\nschedule. If the accumulated revenue recognized by the Company exceed the payments, a\ncontract asset is recognized. If the payments exceed the accumulated revenue recognized,\na contract liability is recognized.\n\n3)\n\nFinancing components\n\nThe  Company  does  not  expect  to  have  any  contracts  where  the  period  between  the\ntransfer  of  the  promised  goods  or  services  to  the  customer  and  the  payment  by  the\ncustomer exceeds one year. As a consequence, the Company does not adjust any of the\ntransaction prices for the time value of money. \n\n(ii) Revenue recognition (applicable before January 1, 2018)\n\nRevenue  from  the  sale  of  goods  or  services  is  measured  at  the  fair  value  of  consideration\nreceived or receivable, net of returns, rebates, and other similar discounts.\n\n1)\n\nSale of goods\n\nRevenue  from  the  sale  of  goods  is  recognized  when  all  the  following  conditions  have\nbeen satisfied: (a) the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been\ntransferred  to  the  buyer;  (b)  the  Company  retains  neither  continuing  managerial\ninvolvement to the degree usually associated with ownership nor effective control over\nthe goods sold; (c) the amount of revenue can be measured reliably; (d) it is probable that\nthe economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Company; and (e)\nthe cost incurred or to be incurred, in respect of the transaction, can be measured reliably.\n\nThe timing of the transfers of risks and rewards varies depending on the individual terms\nof the sales agreement. Revenue is not recognized for the sale of key components to an\noriginal  design  manufacturer  for  manufacture  or  assembly  as  the  significant  risks  and\nrewards of the ownership of materials are not transferred.\n\nRevenue from extended warranty contracts is deferred and amortized as earned over the\ncontract period, ranging from one to three years.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED\n\nNotes to Parent-Company-Only Financial Statements\n\n36\n\n2)\n\nServices\n\nRevenue from services rendered is recognized by reference to the stage of completion at\nthe reporting date.\n\n3)\n\nRental income, interest income, and dividend income\n\nRental income from investment property is recognized over the lease term on a straight-\nline basis. \n\nDividend income from investments is recognized when the shareholder\xe2\x80\x99s right to receive\npayment has been established, provided that it is probable that the economic benefits will\nflow to the Company and the amount of income can be measured reliably. \n\nInterest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and\nat the effective interest rate applicable.\n\n(iii) Contract costs (applicable commencing January 1, 2018)\n\n1)\n\nIncremental costs of obtaining a contract\n\nThe Company recognizes the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer as\nan  asset  if  the  Company  expects  to  recover  those  costs.  The  incremental  costs  of\nobtaining a contract are those costs that the Company incurs to obtain a contract with a\ncustomer that it would not have incurred if the contract had not been obtained. Costs to\nobtain a contract that would have been incurred, regardless of whether the contract was\nobtained,  shall  be  recognized  as  an  expense  when  incurred,  unless  those  costs  are\nexplicitly chargeable to the customer regardless of whether the contract is obtained.\n\nThe  Company  applies  the  practical  expedient  to  recognize  the  incremental  costs  of\nobtaining a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset\nthat the Company otherwise would have recognized is one year or less.\n\n2)\n\nCosts to fulfil a contract\n\nIf the costs incurred in fulfilling a contract with a customer are not within the scope of\nanother  Standard  (for  example,  IAS  2  Inventories,  IAS  16  Property,  Plant  and\nEquipment or IAS 38 Intangible Assets), the Company recognizes an asset from the costs\nincurred to fulfil a contract only if those costs meet all of the following criteria:\n\n\xef\x82\xb7 the costs relate directly to a contract or to an anticipated contract that the Company can\n\nspecifically identify;\n\n\xef\x82\xb7 the costs generate or enhance resources of the Company that will be used in satisfying\n\n(or in continuing to satisfy) performance obligations in the future; and\n\n\xef\x82\xb7 the costs are expected to be recovered.\n\nGeneral and administrative costs, costs of wasted materials, labor or other resources to\nfulfil the contract that were not reflected in the price of the contract, costs that relate to\nsatisfied  performance  obligations  (or  partially  satisfied  performance  obligations),  and\ncosts for which the Company cannot distinguish whether the costs relate to unsatisfied\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED\n\nNotes to Parent-Company-Only Financial Statements\n\n37\n\nperformance  obligations  or  to  satisfied  performance  obligations  (or  partially  satisfied\nperformance obligations) are recognized as expenses when incurred.\n\n(r) Government grant\n\nA government grant is recognized only when there is reasonable assurance that the Company will\ncomply with the conditions attached to it and that the grant will be received.\n\nA  government  grant  that  becomes  receivable  as  compensation  for  expenses  or  losses  already\nincurred or for the purpose of giving immediate financial support to the Company with no future\nrelated costs is recognized in profit or loss in the period in which it becomes receivable.\n\nGovernment grant is recognized in other gains and losses.\n\n(s)\n\nEmployee benefits \n\n(i) Defined contribution plans\n\nObligations  for  contributions  to  defined  contribution  pension  plans  are  expensed  during  the\nyear in which employees render services.\n\n(ii) Defined benefit plans\n\nThe liability recognized in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the present value of the\ndefined benefit obligation at the reporting date less the fair value of plan assets. The discount\nrate for calculating the present value of the defined benefit obligation refers to the interest rate\nof high-quality government bonds at the financial reporting date that are denominated in the\ncurrency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating the\nterms of the related pension obligation.\n\nThe defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by qualified actuaries using the projected\nunit credit method. When the calculation results in a benefit to the Company, the recognized\nasset is limited to the total amount of the present value of the economic benefits available in\nthe  form  of  refunds  from  the  plan  or  reductions  in  future  contributions  to  the  plan.    The\nminimum funding requirements of any plans applicable to the Company should be taken into\nconsideration  when  determining  the  present  value  of  the  economic  benefits.    An  economic\nbenefit  is  available  to  the  Company  if  it  is  realizable  during  the  life  of  the  plan  or  upon\nsettlement of the plan liabilities.\n\nWhen the benefits of a plan are improved, the expenses related to the increased obligations\nresulting from the services rendered by employees in the past years are recognized in profit or\nloss immediately.\n\nThe remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability (asset) comprise (i) actuarial gains and\nlosses; (ii) return on plan assets, excluding amounts included in net interest on the net defined\nbenefit  liability  (asset);  and  (iii)  any  change  in  the  effect  of  the  asset  ceiling,  excluding\namounts  included  in  net  interest  on  the  net  defined  benefit  liability  (asset).  The\nremeasurements  of  the  net  defined  benefit  liability  (asset)  are  recognized  in  other\ncomprehensive income and reflected in other equity.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED\n\nNotes to Parent-Company-Only Financial Statements\n\n38\n\nThe Company recognizes gains or losses on the curtailment or settlement of a defined benefit\nplan when the curtailment or settlement occurs. The gain or loss on curtailment or settlement\ncomprises any resulting change in the fair value of plan assets and any change in the present\nvalue of the defined benefit obligation. \n\n(iii) Short-term employee benefits\n\nShort-term  employee  benefit  obligations  are  measured  on  an  undiscounted  basis  and  are\nexpensed during the period in which employees render services.  A liability is recognized for\nthe  amount  expected  to  be  paid  under  short-term  cash  bonus  or  profit-sharing  plans  if  the\nCompany has a present legal or constructive obligation to make such payments as a result of\npast service provided by the employees, and the obligation can be estimated reliably.\n\n(t)\n\nShare-based payment\n\nShare-based payment awards granted to employees are measured at fair value at the date of grant.\nThe fair value determined at the grant date is expensed over the period that the employees become\nunconditionally entitled to the awards, with a corresponding increase in equity. The compensation\ncost is adjusted to reflect the number of awards given to employees for which the performance and\nnon-market conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognized shall be\nbased on the number of equity instruments that eventually vested. \n\nThe grant date of options for employees to subscribe new shares for a cash injection is the date when\nthe Board of Directors approves the exercise price and the shares to which employees can subscribe. \n\n(u)\n\nIncome taxes \n\nIncome tax expenses include both current taxes and deferred taxes.  Current and deferred taxes are\nrecognized in profit or loss unless they relate to business combinations or items recognized directly\nin equity or other comprehensive income.\n\nCurrent tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using\ntax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustments to tax payable in\nrespect of previous years.\n\nDeferred  income  taxes  are  recognized  in  respect  of  temporary  differences  between  the  carrying\namounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation\npurposes.  Deferred taxes are not recognized for:\n\n(i)\n\nTemporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is\nnot a business combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable profit nor loss;\n\n(ii) Temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures to the extent\nthat the Company is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences, and\nit is probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future; and\n\n(iii) Temporary differences arising from initial recognition of goodwill.\n\nDeferred  tax  assets  are  recognized  for  unused  tax  losses,  tax  credits,  and  deductible  temporary\ndifferences to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which\nthey  can  be  utilized.    Deferred  tax  assets  are  reviewed  at  each  reporting  date  and  reduced  to  the\nextent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realized.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED\n\nNotes to Parent-Company-Only Financial Statements\n\n39\n\nDeferred tax is measured based on the expected manner of realization or settlement of the carrying\namount of the assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting\ndate.\n\nDeferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  are  offset  when  where  is  a  legally  enforceable  right  to  offset\ncurrent tax assets against current tax liabilities and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate\nto income taxes levied by the same tax authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable\nentities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.\n\n(v) Earnings per share (\xe2\x80\x9cEPS\xe2\x80\x9d)\n\nThe basic and diluted EPS attributable to stockholders of the Company are disclosed in the financial\nstatements.  Basic  EPS  is  calculated  by  dividing  net  income  attributable  to  stockholders  of  the\nCompany  by  the  weighted-average  number  of  common  shares  outstanding  during  the  year.    In\ncalculating diluted EPS, the net income attributable to stockholders of the Company and weighted-\naverage number of common shares outstanding during the year are adjusted for the effects of dilutive\npotential  common  shares.  The  Company\xe2\x80\x99 s  dilutive  potential  common  shares  include    restricted\nshares of stock issued to employees and profit sharing for employees to be settled in the form of\ncommon stock.\n\n(w) Operating segments\n\nThe Company discloses the operating segment information in the consolidated financial statements.\nTherefore, the Company does not disclose the operating segment information in the parent-company-\nonly financial statements.\n\n5.\n\nCritical Accounting Judgments and Key Sources of Estimation Uncertainty\nThe  preparation  of  the  parent-company-only  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  the  Regulations\nGoverning the Preparation of Financial Reports requires management to make judgments, estimates and\nassumptions  that  affect  the  application  of  the  accounting  policies  and  the  reported  amount  of  assets,\nliabilities, income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe  estimates  and  underlying  assumptions  are  reviewed  on  an  ongoing  basis.  Revisions  to  accounting\nestimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised and in the future periods affected.\n\nInformation about assumptions and estimation uncertainties that have a significant risk of resulting in a\nmaterial adjustment within the next financial year is included as follows:\n\n(a) Revenue recognition (accrual of sales allowance)\n\nThe  Company  recognizes  revenue  when  the  earning  process  is  completed.  The  Company  also\nrecords a provision for estimated future sales allowances in the same period the related revenue is\nrecorded.  Provision  for  estimated  sales  allowances  is  generally  made  and  adjusted  based  on\nhistorical  experience,  market  and  economic  conditions,  and  any  other  known  factors  that  would\nsignificantly affect the allowance. The adequacy of estimations is reviewed periodically. The fierce\nmarket competition and rapid evolution of technology could result in significant adjustments to the\nprovision made.\n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0cACER INCORPORATED\n\nNotes to Parent-Company-Only Financial Statements\n\n40\n\n(b) Valuation of inventory\n\nInventories are measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  The Company uses judgment\nand estimates to determine the net realizable value of inventory at each reporting date.\n\nDue to rapid technological changes, the Company estimates the net realizable value of inventory,\ntaking obsolescence and unmarketable items into account at the reporting date, and then writes down\nthe cost of inventories to net realizable value. The net realizable value of the inventory is mainly\ndetermined  based  on  assumptions  of  future  demand  within  a  specific  time  horizon,  which  could\nresult in significant adjustments.

The  Company\xe2\x80\x99 s  risk  management  policies  are  established  to  identify  and\nanalyze the risks faced by the Company, to set appropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor\nadherence to the controls.  Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to reflect\nchanges in market conditions and the Company\xe2\x80\x99s operations.\n\nThe  Company\xe2\x80\x99 s  management  monitors  and  reviews  the  financial  activities  in  accordance  with\nprocedures  required  by  relevant  regulations  and  internal  controls.  Internal  auditors  undertake\nreviews of risk management controls and procedures, and the results of which are reported to the\nBoard of Directors on a regular basis.\n\n(i)\n\nCredit risk\n\n1)\n\nThe maximum exposure to credit risk \n\nCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Company if a customer or counterparty of a\nfinancial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises principally from\nthe  Company\xe2\x80\x99 s  cash  and  cash  equivalents,  derivative  instruments,  receivables  from\ncustomers, and other receivables.  The maximum exposure to credit risk is equal to the\ncarrying amount of the Company\xe2\x80\x99s financial assets. \n\n2)\n\nConcentration of credit risk\n\nThe  Company  primarily  sells  and  markets  its  multi-branded  IT  products  through  its\nsubsidiaries  and  distributors  in  different  geographic  areas.  The  Company  believes  that\nthere is no significant concentration of credit risk due to the Company\xe2\x80\x99s large number of\ncustomers and their wide geographical spread.\n\n3)\n\nCredit risk from receivables\n\nRefer  to  note  6(f)  for  credit  risk  exposure  of  notes  and  accounts  receivable.  Other\nfinancial  assets  at  amortized  cost  includes  other  receivables  (refer  to  note  6(g)),  time\ndeposits (classified as other financial assets), etc. Abovementioned financial assets are\nconsidered  low-credit-risk  financial  assets,  and  thus,  the  loss  allowance  are  measured\nusing 12 months ECL. Please refer to note 4(f) for descriptions about how the Company\ndetermines the credit risk.\n\n(ii) Liquidity risk\n\nLiquidity  risk  is  the  risk  that  the  Company  will  encounter  difficulty  in  settling  its  financial\nliabilities by delivering cash or another financial assets. The Company manages liquidity risk\nby monitoring regularly the current and mid- to long-term cash demand, maintaining adequate\ncash and banking facilities, and ensuring compliance with the terms of the loan agreements.

To  manage  the  interest  rate  risk,  the  Company\nperiodically  assesses  the  interest  rates  of  bank  loans  and  maintains  good  relationships\nwith financial institutions to obtain lower financing costs. The Company also strengthens\nthe management of working capital to reduce the dependence on bank loans as well as\nthe risk arising from fluctuation of interest rates.\n\nPlease refer to the note on liquidity risk management for details on interest rate exposure\nof the Company\xe2\x80\x99s financial liabilities. The following sensitivity analysis is based on the\nrisk  exposure  to  non-derivative  financial  instruments  on  the  reporting  date.  The\nsensitivity analysis assumes the liabilities carrying floating interest rates recorded at the\nreporting  date  had  been  outstanding  for  the  entire  period.   The change in interest rate\nreported  to  the  key  management  in  the  Company  is  based  on  100  basis  points  (1%),\nwhich is consistent with the assessment made by the key management in respect of the\npossible change in interest rate.\n\nIf the interest rate had been 100 basis points (1%) higher/lower with all other variables\nheld constant, pre-tax income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017\nwould have been $33,000 and $60,000, respectively, lower/higher, which mainly resulted\nfrom the borrowings with floating interest rates.\n\n3)\n\nOther market price risk\n\nThe  Company  is  exposed  to the risk of price fluctuation in securities market resulting\nfrom its investment in publicly traded stocks. The Company supervises the equity price\nrisk actively and manages the risk based on fair value. The Company also has strategic\ninvestments in privately held stocks, in which the Company does not actively participate\nin their trading. \n\nAssuming  a  hypothetical  increase  or  decrease  of  5%  in  equity  prices  of  the  equity\ninvestments at each reporting date, the other comprehensive income for the years ended\nDecember  31,  2018  and  2017,  would  have  increased  or  decreased  by  $146,095  and\n$165,579, respectively.\n\n(ab) Capital management\n\nIn consideration of the industry dynamics and future developments, as well as external environment\nfactors, the Company maintains an optimal capital structure to enhance long-term shareholder value\nby managing its capital in a manner to ensure that it has sufficient and necessary financial resources\nto fund its working capital needs, research and development activities, dividend payments, and other\nbusiness  requirements  for  continuing  operations  and  to  reward  shareholders  and  take  into\nconsideration the interests of other stakeholders.  \n\n(Continued)\n\n\x0c79\n\nACER INCORPORATED\n\nNotes to Parent-Company-Only Financial Statements\n\n(ac) Changes in liabilities from financing activities\n\nReconciliation of liabilities arising from financing activities were as follows:\n\nLong-term debts\n\n7.
